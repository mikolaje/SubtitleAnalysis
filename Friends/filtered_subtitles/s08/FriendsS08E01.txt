太棒了012---Great.
让我换一下底片  好012---Great. Just give me a sec to change film. Okay.
我知道你不希望我知道012---Okay. I know I'm not supposed to know,
但我知道了  我真为你感到高兴012---but I do and I'm so excited for you.
什么回事012---What's going on?
莫妮卡怀孕了012---Monica's pregnant.
天啊  所以说你们两个是奉子成婚012---Oh, my God. Is that why you guys had to get married?
我没有怀孕012---Guys, I'm not pregnant.
精子游得太慢了012---Oh, slow swimmers?
什么  你这是什么意思  你没有怀孕吗012---What?! What do you mean? You're not pregnant?
你没跑去跟别人说我怀孕了吧012---You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
没有012---No.
我马上回来012---I'll be right back.
我们来拍张莫妮卡跟英勇士兵的合照012---Why don't we get a shot of Monica and the bloody soldier.
说起这点  乔伊你得在婚宴开始前换套衣服012---About that, Joey, you have to change before the party.
不行  我没带衣服来换012---I can't. I don't have any other clothes here.
那就拜托去找套衣服012---Find some, please.
别再穿着"我不幸战死于法国"的衣服了012---Anything that doesn't say, "I died tragically in France."
我们让新人跟伴娘们合照一些照片吧012---Why don't we see the bride and the groom, and the bridesmaids.
莫妮卡  你为什么告诉大家你没有怀孕012---Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys that you weren't pregnant?
因为我本来就没怀012---Because I'm not.
我们发现了你的验孕棒  如果你没有怀孕...012---We found your tests. If you're not pregnant...
那是因为我怀孕了012---...it's because I am.
你在胡说什么  菲比  你在胡说什么012---What are you talking about? Phoebe, what are you talking about?
对  我怀了孩子012---Yes, I am with child.
我不想说  因为今天是你们的大喜之日012---I didn't want to say anything because it's your day.
我不想抢了你的风采012---I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
于是你就告诉大家我怀孕了012---So you told people I was pregnant?
你觉得这种对话  我会想要记录下来吗012---Does this look like a conversation I want to remember?
孩子他爸是谁  对啊012---Who's the father? Yeah.
我不能说012---I can't say.
为什么   为什么不行012---Why? Why not?
我不能说  因为他是名人012---I can't say because he's famous.
天啊  是哪个名人012---Oh, my God. Who is it?
菲比  你得告诉我们012---Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
好吧  是詹姆斯.布洛林012---Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.
詹姆斯.布洛林是孩子的爸爸012---James Brolin is the father of my baby.
你指的是芭芭拉·史翠珊的老公詹姆斯·布洛林012---As in Barbra Streisand's husband James Brolin?
什么012---What?!
他从没跟我提过这事012---Well, he never said that to me.
《老友记》  第八季  第1集  在说了"我愿意"之后012---Friends S08E01 The One After I Do
莫妮卡  请你先到旁边012---Monica, if you step away,
我们要拍钱德勒跟伴娘的合照  好012---we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids. Okay.
何不只拍伴娘的合照呢012---How about just the bridesmaids?
我是新郎  听说这个角色很重要012---You know, I am the groom. I was told it was a big deal.
没错  对012---It is. Yeah.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
谢谢你  我现在还没有办法处理这件事012---Thank you for that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
于是你告诉我莫妮卡怀孕了012---So instead you told me Monica was pregnant?
是你说她怀孕了  我只是没反驳你罢了012---You said she was. I just didn't disagree with you.
真狡猾  是啊012---Sneaky. Yeah.
笑一个  姑娘们012---Smile, ladies!
詹姆斯.布洛林  亏你想得出  我知道012---By the way, James Brolin? I know.
我脑海里只蹦出两个人名012---I could only think of two names:
他跟小艾德·贝格利012---Him and Ed Begley Jr. And then...
我记得他是男同志  所以...012---I remembered he's gay, so...
小艾德·贝格利不是男同志012---Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
真的吗012---Really?
非常感谢012---Thank you very much.
先生们女士们  我非常荣幸地012---Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you
首次向大家介绍  钱德勒·宾夫妇012---for the very first time: Mr. And Mrs. Chandler Bing.
到舞池前  我要送你一份礼物012---Before we go out there, I got a present for you.
我才不要把手伸到你的口袋里012---Honey, I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.
不是  我去上了舞蹈课  什么012---No. I've been taking dancing lessons. What?
我上了六星期的舞蹈课012---For the last six weeks.
我希望这一刻能让你永生难忘012---I wanted this to be a moment you'd never forget.
真的是太体贴了012---That is so sweet.
你愿不愿意以夫妻的身份跟我跳第一支舞012---So would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
我愿意012---Yes.
怎么了012---What's the matter?
我的新鞋太滑了012---It's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
你还能跳舞吗  不太行012---Are you gonna be able to do this? Not well.
好消息是我觉得没人在看我们012---Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
你准备好要谈谈了吗012---So are you ready to talk about it?
没有012---No.
现在呢012---Now?
我不要谈012---No!
我们来谈别的事  谢谢012---We'll talk about something else then. Thank you.
孩子他爸是谁012---Who's the father?
亲爱的  我还没有告诉他012---Honey, I haven't told him yet...
我打算先告诉他  再告诉其他人012---...so, until I do, I don't think I should tell anybody else.
没关系  那很合理012---Yeah. That's fine. That's fair.
是泰格吗  菲比012---Is it Tag? Phoebe!
好吧  对不起  我不问了012---Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.
是罗斯吗  是罗斯吧012---Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?
天啊  是乔伊  别说了  好吗012---Oh, my God, it's Joey! Stop it. Okay?
在告诉他之前我不会告诉你的012---I am not gonna tell you until I tell him.
至少我们知道他是个男的012---At least we know it's a him.
天啊012---Oh, sweet Lord.
对不起  好吗  我跑到礼品店012---I'm sorry, okay? I went down to the gift shop.
那里只卖这个跟浴袍012---It was either this or a bathrobe.
你更看重哪点呢  是我的穿着打扮012---Look. What's more important: the way I'm dressed,
还是我能出席你的婚礼012---or being with you on your special day?
我都懒得假装刚才在听你说话012---Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!
我是罗斯  我们应该没有见过012---I'm Ross, I don't believe we met.
我是莫妮卡的哥哥012---I'm Monica's older brother.
我是她在餐厅的同事蒙娜012---Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
你好  她在餐厅的同事蒙娜012---Hello, Mona from her restaurant.
蒙娜  这个名字很美012---Mona. What a beautiful name.
是吗  我一直都很讨厌这个名字012---You think so? I always kind of hated it.
少来了  蒙娜丽莎012---Come on! Mona Lisa.
蒙娜...012---Mona...
利格拉齐012---...Llegglachen.
她是着名的植物学家012---The famous botanist.
不  她...她死了  但是012---Oh, no, she's... Well, she's dead now, but...
她曾经是植物学界最性感的女人012---Supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
真的吗012---Really?
我根本不认识她  琳达·利格拉齐012---See, I never knew about her. Linda Llegglachen...
你在几号桌012---So, what table are you at?
我也是012---Me too.
很好  那就有个喜欢我名字的人跟我同桌了012---Good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
对  没错012---Yes, there will.
猜怎么着  莫莉·吉柏特012---Guess what, Molly Gilbert.
你刚刚被踢到一号桌了012---You've just been bumped up to table one.
如果你没有意见的话012---And if it's all right with you,
我要代替你坐到六号桌012---I'll take your place at table six.
马丁·利格拉齐012---Martin Llegglachen.
这样好多了  现在双手弯曲012---That's better. Now, just bend your arms a little bit.
眼睛看前方012---Now look straight ahead.
这次我要你臀部用力顶012---Okay, this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
钱德勒  你看我的男伴终于来了012---Chandler, darling, look, my date has finally arrived.
这位是丹尼斯·菲利浦斯012---I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
恭喜  谢谢012---Congratulations. Thank you.
丹尼斯是我的老朋友...012---Yes, Dennis is a dear old friend...
还是个绝佳情人012---...and a fantastic lover.
太棒了  丹尼斯  谢谢你取悦我老妈012---Bravo, Dennis. Thanks for pleasing my mother so.
抱歉我没赶上婚礼  我在忙着试镜012---I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony. I was stuck at auditions.
对  丹尼斯正在执导一出百老汇新戏012---Yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
我们应该还没见过  乔伊·崔比安尼012---I don't believe we've met. Joey Tribbiani.
丹尼斯·菲利浦斯012---Dennis Phillips.
多年来我一直很欣赏你的作品012---I've admired your work for years.
你的作品真的很棒  谢谢012---You've done some really amazing stuff. Thank you.
失陪一下  我要去喝点东西012---If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink.
我马上回来012---I'll be back in a moment.
丹尼斯·菲利浦斯  真是太棒了012---Dennis Phillips. That's great.
你们怎么认识的012---How did you guys meet?
那个故事说起来有趣012---Well, it's a funny story.
是惹人发笑  还是惨不忍睹012---Funny, "haha"? Or funny:
谢谢  非常感谢012---Thank you. Thank you very much.
大家请坐012---If everyone will please take your seats,
晚宴马上开始012---dinner will be served.
我以为你在六号桌  不  是九号桌012---I thought you were at table six. No. Nine.
你刚刚给我看时是那样拿的...012---See, before, when you showed it to me, you held it that way...
我被你误导了012---...which was misleading.
你们好012---Hello.
你能请你妈把我的履历表012---Will you see if your mom
拿给丹尼斯·菲利浦斯吗012---can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?
只要能演百老汇舞台剧  我就什么戏都演过了012---If I could get in a Broadway show, then I would've done it all.
电影  电视剧跟舞台剧012---Film, television and theater.
唯一的例外是广播剧012---The only thing left would be radio.
那是留给丑八怪演的012---But that's just for ugly people.
你穿几号鞋  11号  11号半012---What size shoes do you wear? 11, 11 half.
我的鞋子太滑没办法跳舞012---Great. My shoes give me a problem on the dance floor.
你的戏靴能借我吗012---Can I borrow your boots from your costume?
我真不知道把靴子丢到哪里去了  抱歉012---I don't really even know where I left those. Sorry.
你的脚不可能是11号半012---Those aren't 11 half.
好吧  我穿七号的鞋子012---Okay, fine, I'm a 7!
我的脚出奇的小012---I have surprisingly small feet.
但其它部份都很大  我可以露给你看012---But the rest of me is good. I'll show you.
你能相信菲比怀孕了吗012---Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
现在别谈那件事了012---You know what, honey? Let's not talk about that right now.
这可是爆炸性新闻012---This is so huge.
没错  但那也没有你的婚礼重要012---Sure, but as big as your wedding?
当然  我的婚礼最重要了012---Of course not. Nothing is.
说句悄悄话  到了这个时代...012---Between me and you, in this day and age...
谁会笨到让自己怀孕012---...how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
有时候你该做的都做了012---You know? Sometimes you can do everything right.
双方都戴上了该戴的东西012---Everyone wears what they're supposed to wear...
但有个小家伙还是攻过了城池012---...and one of those little guys just gets through.
怎么会呢012---How?
我不知道  或许它们有什么工具012---I don't know. Maybe they have tools.
我跟她谈过  她要把孩子生下来012---Well, I talked to her, and she's definitely gonna have the baby.
她说她要自己抚养孩子012---She said she's gonna raise it on her own.
或许那真的很勇敢012---Well, maybe that's really brave.
或许吧  我只是希望她知道那有多辛苦012---Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
或许她没有想那么多012---Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that much.
的确有很多事需要考虑012---Well, there's a lot to think about.
她要怎么解决经济问题012---How is she gonna handle this financially?
她怎么能应付得了工作012---How is she gonna juggle work?
她知道她在未来的18年内012---Does she realize she's not gonna have a date again
都没法再去约会了吗012---for the next, like, 18 years?
我不知道012---I don't know.
你没事吧012---Are you okay?
我只是想到菲比怀了孕  可怜的菲比012---I'm just thinking about Phoebe. Poor, knockedup Phoebe.
要喝香槟吗012---Champagne?
好的  谢谢你012---Oh, yes! Thank you very much.
法国人都是那样喝香槟的012---That's actually how the French drink it.
我刚刚跟我的情人詹姆斯·布洛林通过电话012---Well, I just got off the phone with my lover James Brolin.
真的吗012---Oh, really?
他显然娶了一个歌手012---Yes. Apparently, he is married to some singer.
但他说他会为了我离开她012---But he said he'd leave her for me.
我说"詹姆斯·布洛林  你确定吗"012---And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?"
詹姆斯·布洛林说...012---James Brolin said...
怀孕的人是瑞秋012---Rachel's really the one who's pregnant?
什么012---What?!
装得那么费劲干嘛012---Why bother?
你感觉如何  我不知道我有什么感觉012---How do you feel? I don't know. I don't know how I feel.
一切都发生得太快了012---This is all happening so fast.
我得做出许多我不想做的决定012---I have to make all these decisions that I don't wanna make.
谁快把这玩意拿走012---Someone just take this away from me!
冷静点  或许你没有怀孕  什么012---Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant. What?!
我怀三胞胎的时候012---When I got pregnant with the triplets,
也验了三次孕才确定012---I took that test, like, three times just to make sure.
对  或许是假警报012---Yes. Maybe it's a false positive.
你确定你在验孕棒上尿的方式没错吗012---Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
不然我要怎么尿才对012---How many ways are there to do that?
我是说在没有百分之百确定前别大惊小怪012---I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're 100 percent sure.
好吧  我回家后会再验一次012---All right, I'll take it again when I get home.
你可以现在验012---You gotta take it now.
就当成送我的礼物吧012---Do it as a present to me.
好吧  谢谢你  好的012---Okay, thank you. Okay.
我去帮你买验孕棒012---I'll run out and get you one.
你们真是太好了012---You girls are so great.
等一下  孩子他爸是谁012---Wait a minute. Who's the father?
她不肯告诉我们012---She won't tell us.
快说吧  这可是我的婚礼012---Come on! It's my wedding.
你可以把这当做是送我的礼物012---That could be my present!
我刚刚答应为了你验孕012---I just gave you peeing on a stick.
看吧  所以一定要做礼物登记012---See, this is why you register.
又是椅子的声音  好吗  我没放012---It was the chair again. Okay? I'm not doing it!
这样吧012---It was... Look, you know what?
你想跳舞吗  好啊012---Would you like to dance? Sure.
太棒了012---Great.
盖勒博士  我没有放屁012---Dr. Geller. I wasn't farting!
那是我们那一桌玩的小游戏012---A little game from our table.
什么事  盖勒博士  你愿意跟我跳舞吗012---Yes? Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
或许待会再说  现在我要跟这位小姐跳舞012---Maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.
好吧012---Okay.
除非这位小姐不介意让你插队012---Unless this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.
我很乐意  你太好心了012---I'd be happy to. You are very sweet.
没错  我确实好心012---Yes, I am.
我们来试试我的绝招012---In fact, why don't we try my special way?
你可以踩在我的脚上跳舞012---You can dance on my feet.
没问题  是吗  跳上来吧012---Sure. Yeah? Hop on.
那个美丽的小姐在看吗  在012---Is the pretty lady looking? Uhhuh.
继续跳012---Keep dancing.
世上无人将欣赏到这般舞姿012---And the world will never know.
你跟丹尼斯提过我的事了吗012---Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
我跟他提到你非常有天份012---Yes. I told him how talented you were
还有《我们的日子》的事012---and I told him all about Days of our Lives.
不不不  你不能把那种事告诉百老汇导演012---No, no, no! You don't tell a Broadway guy that!
现在他会以为我只是个肥皂剧演员012---Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.
但你不只是肥皂剧演员012---But you're not just a soap actor.
你是长了双小脚的肥皂剧演员012---You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
谢谢  不  谢谢你  米兰达012---Thank you. No, thank you, Miranda.
是梅玲达  好吧012---Melinda. All right.
那简直太可爱了012---How cute was that?
你在看我们吗012---Oh, were you watching?
下一个能跟我跳吗012---Can I go next?
当然可以  来吧012---Of course you can. Hop on.
好吧  但我要排在她后面012---Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
我一定能"得分" 什么012---I am so gonna score. What?
我喜欢你的蝴蝶结012---I like your bow.
我要请大家举杯向莫妮卡及钱德勒致意012---I'd like to propose a toast to Monica and Chandler...
他们是全世界最般配的夫妻012---...the greatest couple in the world,
也是我最好的朋友012---and my best friends.
我刚听说他们要结婚时012---When I first found out they were getting married,
我有点生气012---I was... I was a little angry.
我心想"天啊  为什么012---I was like, "Why, God? Why?
你为什么要把他们从我身边抢走"012---How can you take them away from me!"
然后我回想起我们之间有过的回忆012---But then I thought back over all our memories together.
快乐的回亿012---Some happy memories.
还有悲伤的回亿012---And there were some sad memories.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
还有可怕的回亿012---And some scared memories.
然后我才发现  我永远都会是他们的朋友012---And then I realized I'll always be their friend.
他们这个朋友会说好几种方言012---Their friend who can speak in many dialects...
接受过舞台训练012---...and has training in stage combat
愿意拍部份裸露的戏份012---and is willing to do partial nudity.
敬这对金童玉女012---To the happy couple.
谢谢  刚才跳得很棒  艾许莉012---Thank you. That was very nice, Ashley.
我们能再跳一次吗   不行012---Can we do it again? No, no.
现在轮到我了吗  我是下一个012---So, is it my turn now? I'm next.
没关系  你可以先跟她跳012---That's okay, you can dance with her first.
你确定吗012---Are you sure?
好吧012---Okay.
你叫什么名字  葛特012---Okay, so, what's your name? Gert.
名字真美012---That's pretty.
你想要做什么  葛特012---What are you doing there, Gert?
跟其他女孩一样踩在你脚上跳舞012---Dancing on your feet like the other girls did it.
好吧012---Okay.
跳上来吧  葛特012---Hop on, Gert.
你的脚为什么不动012---Why aren't you moving your feet?
我在努力了012---I'm trying.
快一点  你跳得太慢了012---Faster. You're not going fast enough.
或许我该踩在你脚上012---Maybe I should stand on your feet!
你听到我的致词了吗012---So did you happen to catch my toast up there?
天啊  你那么做是为了我012---Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?
我那么做是为了所有人012---There was a little something for everyone.
我知道你在为新戏选角012---I know you're casting for this new show.
我觉得你不适合这部戏012---Look, Joey. I don't think you're right for this project.
你这就错了吧012---See, that's where you're wrong.
不论是什么戏  我都能演012---Whatever it is, I can do it.
如果你对刚刚的表演不满意  考考我012---If you didn't see it up there, just try me.
那出戏的演员全是中国人012---It's an all Chinese cast.
你可以变成中国人吗012---Can you be Chinese?
我不以此为荣  但是...012---Well, I'm not proud of this, but...
天啊  求求你别那么做012---Oh, my God. No, no, no. Please don't!
准备重回舞池了吗012---Ready to get back to the dance floor?
它变成沙地了吗012---Did it turn into sand?
我喜欢这首歌  你会跳得很好的012---Come on, I love this song. Come on. You'll be fine.
不  我跳不好012---No. No, I won't.
你知道为什么我要去上舞蹈课吗012---Do you know why I took all those lessons?
我不希望让别人看到012---For the first time, I didn't want you to be embarrassed
你跟一个跳梁小丑跳舞  丢光了脸012---to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
老公  你绝不会让我出丑012---Oh, sweetie, you could never embarrass me.
好吧  你很容易就会让我出丑012---Okay, you could easily embarrass me.
但那不重要  好吗012---But it doesn't matter, all right?
我嫁给你了012---I married you.
我要在新婚之夜跟我丈夫跳舞  来吧012---So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on.
