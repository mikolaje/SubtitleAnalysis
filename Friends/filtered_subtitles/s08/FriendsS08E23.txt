到了012---All right!
太棒了  从家里到医院花了不到七分钟012---Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! 
我们办到了012---We did it.
对  最艰苦的部分彻底结束了012---Yes, the hard part is truly over.
打起精神来 012---No, but come on, 
我们算是开了个好头  对吧012---we're off to a great start, aren't we?
我知道可以很快赶过来012---I knew I'd get here fast.
但这个速度一定是创下了记录012---But this has gotta be some kind of a record!
你们赶到了  嗨012--- Oh, you made it!  Hi.
你们怎么会比我们先到  012---How the hell did you beat us here?
我们搭的计程车  你们是走过来的吗012---We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
不  我们也是搭计程车  但我做过实验...012---No, we took a cab too. But I did test runs...
你们赶到了012---Hey, you made it!
好吧  难不成有魔法地道通到这家医院吗012---Okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?
罗斯  你留下来聊天 012---Ross, you stay here and talk.
我要去生孩子了012---I'm gonna go have a baby.
好吧  你好  她是瑞秋·格林012---Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
我是罗斯·盖勒  我们在车上打过电话012---I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.
对  我们为你们准备了双人待产室012---Right. We have a semiprivate labor room waiting for you, so...
对不起  双人房  012---Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semiprivate?
我们订了单人房012---We asked for a private room.
我知道  012---Yes, I see that here.
不幸地是我们无法保证一定有单人房012---Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.
现在单人房都满了  012---And, currently, they're all unavailable.
你要是早点赶过来就好了012---Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
抱歉 我们只有双人待产室012---I'm sorry. Semiprivate rooms are all we have.
好吧  等我们一下  罗斯012---Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
什么 012---Yeah?
塞点钱给她  012---Give her some money.
我觉得他们真的没房间了012---I really think they're out of rooms.
才怪  罗斯 012---They're not, Ross.
他们是为大人物留的012---They're just saving them for important people!
好吧  如果我是总统呢 012---Okay? What if I was the president?
那么我们的麻烦就大了 012---Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
你不知道任何国家的地理位置012---You don't know where any countries are.
好吧012---Okay.
你能再帮我们确认一遍吗 012---Say, would you mind checking again?
有没有我们可以使用的单人待产室 012---See if any private rooms may have opened up?
这里是医院012---This is a hospital.
好吧  你知道吗  我得说012---Okay, you know what? I have to say,
我真的不喜欢你的语气012---I don't really care for your tone.
这不是市里唯一一家医院012---And this is not the only hospital in this city,
我们完全可以... 天啊012---and we have no problem... Oh, gosh!
什么  是阵痛012--- What? What?  Contraction!
你们想看看双人待产室吗  012---Would you like to see a semiprivate room?
好吧  看看又何妨012---Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
《老友记》  第八季  第23集  瑞秋生孩子012---Friends S08E23 The One Where Rachel Has A Baby
你的子宫颈只开了两公分 012---Well, you're only two centimeters dilated,
得等开到十公分才行012---and we need to get to 10.
那得等上一段时间  好吧012--- It'll be a while.  Oh, okay.
我一小时后再回来帮你检查  谢谢012--- I'll be back in an hour to check you again. Thank you.
看来这段时间我们有的闲了012---I guess we have some time to kill.
没错012---Yeah, guess so.
你看012---Oh, check these out.
我以前从没这么玩过012---Never done this before.
对  看起来棒极了012---Yeah, well, it looks great.
谢谢  我想我们准备好...012---Thank you very much. I think we're ready to...
嗨  我是罗斯 012---Hi, I'm Ross. 
抱歉毁了你们的大好日子012---I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
一点都不会  没关系的  012---Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
马克·何格  她是我太太茱莉012---Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
嗨  茱莉  她是瑞秋  012---Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
嗨  瑞秋012---Oh, hi, Rachel.
这是你的第一胎  对012--- Is this your first?  Yeah, it is.
小吉米是我们的第三胎012---Well, little Jamie here is our third.
如果你们有问题012---So if you have any questions, 
或需要帮忙  叫我们一声就好012---or you need anything at all, just holler.
那真是太棒了  对012--- That's so sweet.  Yeah.
我之前把帘子拉开了  我来给你们留点隐私012---I opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy.
没关系  我们同舟共济012---Nonsense. We're all in this together.
我们愿意跟你们分享待产的每一刻012---We are gonna share every moment of this with you.
我想我们会相处得非常愉快  对012--- And I think we're gonna have some fun.  Yeah.
好吧  笑一个012--- Oh, okay, I guess.  Hey, smile!
我不知道...  我真的不要...012--- I don't know if...  I really don't want any...
谢谢012---Oh, thank you.
罗斯  我又开始阵痛了012---Oh, Ross! Here comes another contraction.
好吧  深呼吸012---Okay, just breathe.
老公  我也开始阵痛了  012---Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
来吧  不012--- Here you go!  Oh, no!
天啊012---Oh, my God!
你看012---Hey, look at this.
三个小时过去了还是没生012---Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
生产的奇迹让人很想打磕睡012---The miracle of birth sure is a snoozefest.
你要看点好玩的事吗  012---Hey, you wanna see something?
当然  什么012---Sure. What?
这一定会很有意思012---This is gonna be fun.
看我怎么吓钱德勒012---Watch me freak out Chandler.
老公  什么事012--- Honey?  Yeah?
听着  我一直在想012---Listen, I've been doing some thinking...
我不知道是因为我们身处医院012---...and I don't know whether it's because we're here...
还是瑞秋要生孩子了012---...or Rachel's giving birth...
但我觉得我们应该开始造小孩了012---...but I think we should try to have a baby.
好吧012---Okay.
你说什么 012---What's that now?
好吧  我也一直在想这件事 012---Okay. I've been thinking about it too, 
我觉得我们准备好了012---and I think we're ready.
你在开玩笑吗  012---Are you kidding me?
你觉得我们现在就准备好要怀孕了012---You think we're ready to have a baby now?
这确实很好玩012---This is fun.
你们准备要怀孕了  012---You're ready to have a baby?
我的小男孩长大了012---My boy's all grown up!
你说你也准备好了012---You said you were ready too.
对  我只是想跟你开玩笑012---Yeah, but I was just screwing with you
逼你用高八度的怪声音说话012---to try to get your voice all high and weird...
就像我现在一样012---...like mine is now!
对  但你不是一直都想要生孩子吗 012---Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?
好吧  滚开  先生012---Okay, then, back off, mister!
我确实准备好生孩子了012---Because I am ready to have a baby.
我只是希望乔伊是孩子他爸012---I just want Joey to be the father.
什么  你疯了吗  012---What? Are you crazy?
就是那样  那就是我的目的012---That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
实在抱歉  012---I am so sorry.
医生坚持要拉上帘子做检查012---The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
那非常... 真的没关系012---Oh, that's very... Really, very, very okay.
茱莉的子宫颈开了七公分 012---Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters.
大约是四指宽012---That's about four fingers!
医生让我自己摸摸看  012---Doctor let me feel it myself.
你摸过瑞秋的子宫颈吗  罗斯012---Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
没有  我们不会那么做  我们不会那么做012--- No, we're not gonna do that.  We won't be doing that.
如果你愿意的话  你可以摸摸瑞秋的 012---Well, if you like, you could feel Rachel's, 
再摸摸我的做比较012---then feel mine to compare.
我打扰了你们吗  012---Am I interrupting?
太棒了  谢谢  待会见012---Yes! Thank you! Later.
不  你不能丢下我跟他们独处  对不起012--- No, you can't leave me alone with these people. Oh, I'm sorry.
不  罗斯  我的孩子没有父亲012---No, Ross? Ross? Ross? My child has no father!
很高兴你能过来  可能还要再等一阵 012---I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while.
你该先打电话来012---I wish you'd called first.
没关系  我待会再跟你爸来一趟012---That's all right. I'm coming back later with your father.
在孩子出生前  我得跟你谈一谈  012---I acturally needed to talk to you before the birth.
好吧  什么事012---Okay. What's up?
我有样东西要给你012---I brought something that I want to give you.
当然前提是你需要的话012---Assuming, of course, that you want it.
妈  你要我娶你吗012---Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
这是你外婆的订婚戒指 012---This is your grandmother's engagement ring.
我要你把它送给瑞秋012---I want you to give it to Rachel.
妈  不  别这样  012---Mom, no. Come on. 
谢谢你  听我说...012--- Thank you.  Just hear me out...
不要  我们谈过了012---No! Okay? We've been through this.
我们不会因为她怀孕了就去结婚  好吗 012---We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant. Okay?
说真的  罗斯 012---Honestly, Ross, 
她不是你在酒吧泡到就上的女孩012---this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.
罗斯  孩子应该要有个完整的家庭012---Ross, a child should have a family.
你知道吗  我现在无法思考此事  抱歉012---You know what? I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry.
考虑一下吧 012---Just think about it.
如果你不收  我会再跟你谈上女孩的事012---If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
给我吧012---Give me.
嗨  亲爱的  谢谢你赶过来012--- Hi, dear.  Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
罗斯  快进来012---Ross, get in here!
她把我拖出待产室 012---She dragged me out of the labor room 
问我为什么不跟瑞秋结婚012---to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
对012---Yeah.
你为什么不跟瑞秋结婚  012---Why aren't you with Rachel?
你在开玩笑吗012---You're kidding, right?
我们不会因为孩子的关系就去办结婚012---Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having this baby.
但你们俩看着很般配012---But it just seems that you two belong together.
别说了  现在我没法想这件事 012---Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this right now.
我得去等孩子出生012---I have to go have a baby.
对  孩子他妈是谁来着012---Right. And with who again?
他简直疯了 他为什么不想跟瑞秋结婚 012---He's crazy. Why doesn't he wanna be with Rachel?
就是啊012---I know.
说真的  她是个完美的姑娘012---Seriously, she's like the perfect woman.
我知道她拒绝了我...012---I mean, I know she turned me down...
如果她没有拒绝  她想跟我在一起012---...but if she hadrt and she wanted to be with me...
我会抱着她...012---...I would take her in my arms and...
我有一阵子没有这样吓你们了吧 012---I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while, have I ?
那是谁  新来的012--- Who's that?  New people.
恶心夫妇怎么了 012---What happened to the Disgustingtons?
他们去生孩子了 012---They're having their baby.
这不公平  罗斯  是我先来的012---It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
你离开不久  他们就将她推进产房了012---Right after you left, they wheeled her off into delivery.
但她走之前  她的产道如鲜花怒放012---Oh, but not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little Jamie
画面十分生动012---just crowning away.
抱歉012---Wow. Sorry.
新来的人怎么样012---So how are the new people?
他们给对方起的昵称都很奇怪012---Well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.
其中有"恶婆娘"和"臭混蛋"012---Including "Evil Bitch" and "Sick Bastard."
天啊  阵痛  012---Oh, gosh, a contraction.
是吗  好了  深呼吸012---Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
你在看她吗  不012--- Are you looking at her?  No!
别看她  你个臭混蛋012---Don't you look at her, you sick bastard!
我发誓  没有在看她 012---Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!
她在生小孩012---She's in labor.
你喜欢吗  你个狗娘养的012---You like that, you sick son of a bitch?
我还是把...012---I'm just gonna...
看吧  都是你偷看的关系  变态死胖子012---See? It's because you were looking, you fat pervert.
不  我相信没有人在偷看 012---No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
我们只是需要一点隐私012---Just want some privacy.
你想念你的女朋友吗 012---You miss your girlfriend?
别管他们012---Just ignore them.
你没事吧  没事012--- You okay?  Yeah.
罗斯  怎么了012--- Ross.  What?
他在盯着我看012---He's looking at me.
你还想活着看到自己的孩子出生吗012---You wanna live to see your baby?
你竟敢这么跟我老公说话  你个臭混蛋012---Don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!
天啊  如果你那么想要孩子  去偷一个吧012---Oh, good God! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!
你是怎么了  012---What is going on with you.
你什么时候这么喜欢孩子了012---Since when are you so crazy about babies?
我不是喜欢孩子  我是喜欢和你在一起012---I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
什么 012---What?
我们总是说以后要生孩子 012---We've always talked about having babies someday, 
我没说非得是现在012---I'm not saying it has to be right now, 
但我觉得我们现在能应付得来  012---...but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. 
我们准备好了012---We're good.
我们真的准备好了012---We're really good.
我们准备齐全了012---We are pretty good.
但你没准备好前我是不会行动的012---But nothing has to happen until you're ready.
也许我现在就准备好了012---Well, maybe I'm ready now.
虽说稍微有点吓人  但感觉对了012---I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
什么感觉对了012---What? It's not right!
我们还没有准备好要生孩子012---We're not ready to have a kid now!
什么  012---What? 
我在开玩笑  这一定会很好玩012---I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
我们要试试看吗  我们现在就要试吗 012---So we're gonna try? I mean, we're trying?
我们要试着怀孕012---We're trying to get pregnant.
我不想在宝宝面前干这种勾当012---I'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
你想什么时候开始试  012---So when do you want to start trying? 
好吧  等一下012---All right, hold on a sec.
你在算生理周期  对012--- Period math?  Yeah.
我们可以从现在开始012---Well, we could start trying now.
在这里吗  不是012--- Right here?  No, not here.
这里也可以啊012---Maybe here.
这里太适合了  我们有大把时间要消磨012---It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill,
而且医院里到处都是床012---and we're in a building that's full of beds!
还很干净012---And it's so clean!
快点  你这台蠢机器  来嘛012---Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
把你的钱吃掉了吗  012---It ate your money? 
没有012---No.
那么楼下见  好吧012--- I'll see you downstairs then.  All right.
我拿到了012---Hey, I got one! I got one!
上还是下  下楼  谢谢012--- Oh, up or down?  Oh. Down, please.
我讨厌抢男人的风头  但可以由我来吗 012---I hate to be a ballbuster, but can I just do it?
麻烦你帮我按上  没问题012--- Could you press up too?  Sure.
我真的很遗憾  我也曾摔断过腿  012---I feel bad for you. I broke my leg once too.
是吗  你怎么会摔断腿012---Yeah? How'd yours happen?
说来话长  有点丢脸012---Well, it's a long story, it's kind of embarrassing.
其实是性爱手册排版上出了点小错误012---Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
你呢  车祸012--- How about you?  Car accident.
有个白痴在打手机  没注意看路012---Let me guess. Some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
对  就是我012---Yeah. Me.
我的电梯来了012---Oh, hey, that's me.
我猜你是来探病的  没错012--- Hey, I take it you're just visiting someone.  Yeah.
如果你有时间  想探望其他人...012---Well, if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else...
对  我很乐意012---Yeah, I would like that.
等一下  不要啊  012---Wait! What? No! 
电梯等等012---Elevator! No!
你得按按钮才行012---You gotta press the button.
护士说他们要送另一位女人过来012---The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
她已经怀孕了吗 012---Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
她根本不需要怀孕012---She doesn't need to be.
她还是能赶在我之前把孩子生下来012---She'll still have the baby before I do.
罗斯  我又阵痛了  好吧012--- Oh, Ross! Another contraction.  Oh, okay. Here, here.
没错012---That's it.
听起来好像很痛  没错012--- Oh, that sounded like a bad one.  Yeah, it was.
我的阵痛没有那么厉害  又来了012---Mine haven't been so bad. Oh, here comes one now.
真的好痛012---Oh, that was a big one.
打扰一下  你能帮我个忙吗 012---Excuse me, could you help me with something?
我在找一位一条腿骨折的病人012---The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg.
他坐着轮椅  31到35岁  非常迷人012---He's in a wheelchair. He's early to mid30s, very attractive.
我知道你在说谁  012---I know who you're talking about.
太棒了  他住几号病房012---Great! What room number is he in?
小姐  对不起012---Ma'am, I'm sorry.
只有医院人员能查看资料012---That information is restricted to hospital staff.
她跟我是一起的  德雷克·拉莫瑞医生  012---She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
哪个德雷克医生012---Dr. Drake who?
拉莫瑞  那是葡萄牙姓氏012---Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
我们需要他的资料  我是医生012---We need that information. I'm a doctor.
这间医院的医生  012---A doctor at this hospital?
该死  我们正在浪费宝贵的时间012---Damn it, we're losing precious time.
你希望头上沾上这个男人的血...012---You want this man's blood on your head...?
是手  手上012--- Hands.  Hands!
你必须告诉我012---It is absolutely essential that you tell me 
我助手描述的病人住几号病房012---what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
他是我的病人  我为他治疗多年了012---He's a patient of mine. I've treated him for years.
他住816号病房  816  谢谢012--- He's in room 816.  816. Thank you.
他叫什么名字  不要012--- And what is his name?  No.
我们找到地方了  好吧012--- I think we found a place.  Okay.
等一下  你想增加点气氛吗 012---Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
好  把灯调暗  好吧012--- Okay. We'll dim the lights.  Okay.
或是通通关掉012---Or turn them out altogether.
没有精油蜡烛  好吧  来  喷一喷012---No scented candles. Okay, here. There we go.
好吧  帮我消了毒（不孕）  但没关系012---Okay, okay. Making me sterile, but okay.
对不起  等一下  我们有安全套吗 012---Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait. Do we have a condom?
对了012---Oh, right!
好  37摄氏度  你没有大碍012---Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
就是这里012---This is it!
就是他  太棒了  去找他吧012--- That's him!  Great. Go get him!
等一下  你可以先进去012---Wait a second. Or maybe you could go in first.
他真的不是我的菜012---He's not really my type.
不是以你的身份  而是拉莫瑞医生 012---Not you. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
你可以问他问题  看看他是个什么样的人012---You could ask him questions and see what he's like.
大家对医生什么都肯说012---People tell doctors everything.
你说他是个好男人012---But you said he was this great guy.
我认识的男人一开始看上去都很好 012---Lately all the guys I meet seem nice at first, 
最后都成了大混蛋012---then turn out to be the biggest jerks.
你的确吸引了一些烂男人  对  我知道012--- You do attract some stinkers.  Yeah, I know.
朗医生 我已经等了17个小时012---Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.
三个女人进进出出  生下了孩子012---Three women have come and gone with their babies.

我要把孩子生出来012---I'm gonna push this baby out.
我现在就要生  三公分 012---I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
大概有这么宽吧012---That's gotta be like this, right?
