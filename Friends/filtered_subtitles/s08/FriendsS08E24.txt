 如果你有时间想拜访其他人...  对  我很乐意012--- Wanna visit someone else?  Yeah, I would like that.
 就是他  太棒了  去找他吧012--- That's him.  Great. Well, go get him.

嗨  我是德瑞克拉莫瑞医生 我得问你几个例行的问题012---Hi, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few routine questions.
你会跟女人上了床后 不再打电话给她们吗?012---Do you sleep with women and never call them again?

我们该告诉瑞秋 她隔壁就有一问单人待产室吗?012---Should we tell Rachel there's an empty, private room right next door to hers?
没错  或许我们可以在这里做爱012---We could. Or we could have sex in it.
让我边脱裤子边想012---Well, let me think about that. While I remove my pants.
好吧  先生  来造人吧012---Okay, mister. Fertilize me.
那是珍妮丝的声音吗?012---Does that sound like Janice?
如果不是的话  就是有个人很像她012---If it's not, then there's two of them.
那表示世界末日到了012---And that would mean it's the end of the world.

那真的很有趣  会痛吗? 生产会痛吗?012---That's funny. Does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
好吧  我想到一个 如果非吃不可  你要吃哪一个?012---Okay, I've got one for you. If you had to, which would you rather eat?
千里眼的小狗或会说话的猩猩?012---A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
我猜是会说话的猩猩012---I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
因为至少我可以跟他解释 是你逼我吃掉他012---Because at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.
 有人读过大学  对012--- Oh. Somebody went to college.  Yeah.
怎么了?对不起012---Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
对不起  我的脚好痒012---Oh, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
让我来吧012---On. I'll get it.
通常我会跟女人混熟后 才会让她用汤匙帮我搔痒012---Wow. I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.
别激动  它不是叉子012---Relax. It's not like we're forking.
一共是五个  罗斯 五个女人生了五个孩子...012---Oh, that's five, Ross. Five women have had five babies...

她为什么不肯出来?012---Why doesn't she want to come out?
你知道我在想什么吗? 我想九个月来...012---You know what I think it is?I think you made such a nice home for her...
她在你的身体里很舒服 所以她不想离开012---...over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
你甚至在瞎编哄我012---Oh. Look at you making up crap for me.
 天啊  好吧012--- Oh, God. Ooh, ooh...  Okay. Okay.
21小时  你是英雄012---Twentyone hours. You're a hero.
医生  你得想想办法 给我药...012---Doctor, you gotta do something. You gotta give me drugs...
或是放火 把她熏出来012---...or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
事实上 我想你可以进产房了012---Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
什么?012--- What?
开了10公分了 你快当妈妈了012---  Ten centimeters.You're about to become a mom.

如果...如果你想知道的话 我们觉得你是个好人012---Um, if it, you know If it helps, you came off great.
比现在的我好多了012---A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
我不敢相信 你要他假扮医生?012---I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
假扮?对不起  哈罗012---Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
 你要我以为自己疯了?  那是不对的  我非常抱歉012---And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy?You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
那只是因为我非常喜欢你 我们能重新开始吗?012---It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just start over?
我不那么认为012---I don't think so.
我可以说话吗? 你跟我透露了很多你的私事012---Uh, if I may?Look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?
或许你应该知道 一些关于她的私事012---Now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.

她帮她弟弟 生下三胞胎012---Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets.

 我们不想听那些疯狂的事  对012--- Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.  Right.
我们并不认识彼此 要忘了这些很容易...012---Look, we don't really know each other, so it'd be really easy to just forget about this...
但我们对彼此有感觉 我不知道你是怎么样...012---...but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you...
但我不是常常遇到这种事012---...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

 你们取好名字了吗?  还没有012--- Do we have a name yet?  No, not yet.
没关系 先叫她葛林之女012---That's fine. For now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
不  盖勒葛林之女012---Oh, no. Baby Girl GellerGreen.
嗨  小女孩012---Hello, Baby Girl.

她看起来好真实012---She looks so real.
你们了解我的意思012---You know what I mean.

宝贝  你好可爱012---Yes. Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute.
我可以捏碎你小小的头012---Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
我不会那么做的012---I won't.
 甜心  怎么了?  没事  我只是不由自主地哭了012--- Honey, what's the matter?  Nothing. Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
医生说这很正常 都是荷尔蒙害的  而且我还会睡不着012---The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, youyou’re sleep deprived.
你们都会失眠012---So? You guys are all sleep deprived.
我没看过你因为鞋子穿错脚 就哭个不停012---I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.
天啊012---Oh, God.
 怎么了?  我又想起来了012--- What's the matter now?  I was reliving it.
你们帮她 取好名字了吗?012---So do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
等一下  她不是叫女儿吗? 我觉得那个名字很有创意012---Oh. Wait a minute, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?I thought that was so original.
事实上 我们正在考虑两个名字012---Uh, actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.
你知道吗?两个名字我都很喜欢 你们帮忙桃一个012---Yeah, and you know what? I love them both.So why don't you just pick one, and that'll be it.
好吧  大伙们...012---Wow, um, okay. Uh, everyone?
她是伊莎贝儿012---This is Isabella.
嗨  伊莎贝充 嗨012--- Hi, Isabella.  Hi.
什么?012--- What?
那不是她的名字012---  That's not her name.
抱歉 她感觉上不像伊莎贝儿012---I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
 另一个名字是什么?  笛莉拉012--- What was the other one, Ross?  Um, Delilah.
太棒了 突然间她成了圣经里的妓女012---Oh, great. Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
我猜还是叫她女儿吧012--- Ahem, so I guess we're back to Baby Girl.  Yay.
我们该怎么办?012---What are we gonna do?
 没关系  你们会想到好名字的  你说的倒容易012--- It's okay, honey. You'll find a name.  Ugh. Easy for you to say.
你已经知道 你的孩子要叫什么名字了012---You already know what your kids' names are gonna be.
 是吗?  我14岁时就帮他们取好了名字012--- You do?  Yeah. I had them picked out since I was 14.
不  你的宝宝会以点心 或烘烤食物的名字来命名吧?012---Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it?
 告诉我们你想了什么名字  好吧  如果是男孩的话就叫丹尼尔012--- Well, tell us, what are they?  Um, okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
 如果是女孩呢?  我不想说012--- And if it's a girl?  I don't want to say.
少来了  告诉我们 我们不会抢走它的012---Oh, stop. Tell us. We're not gonna want it.
好吧  她叫艾玛012---Okay. It's Emma.
艾玛012---Emma.
看吧  我不喜欢它012---See, I don't want it.
 拿去吧  什么?012--- Take it.  What?
她真的很适合叫艾玛012---She's clearly an Emma.
甜心  但你喜欢那个名字012---Oh, honey, but you love that name.
对  但我更爱你012---Yeah. But I love you more.
而且什么名字都跟宾不配 所以我是死定了012---Besides, you know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed.
亚朗利普曼古扛尼克 要跟他未来的新娘打个招呼012---Aaron LipmanGuralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.
他真的会让人说不出话来 对吧?012---Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?
他是个谦虚的人012---He's a keeper.
 你觉得如何?  我很好012--- How are you feeling?  Oh, you know, I'm fine.
我真的很佩服你做的事 你要自己抚养她012---Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing.Just raising her all alone.
我不是一个人  我有罗斯012---Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
现在是的  如果他认识别人结了婚 那时又会是怎么样的呢?012---Oh, sure. Now.But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
他会离婚的 那就是罗斯012---Well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.
我得告诉你  瑞秋  听珍妮丝的话012---I'm telling you, Rachel. Listen to Janice.
男人都说他们会在 但他们会成立自己的家庭012---They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.
 罗斯不会那么做的  以前我也那么相信012---That's never gonna happen with Ross.That's what I thought about my first husband.
如果我的孩子能跟她爸 及新的波霸小姐共度一个周末...012---Now, I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father...
那算我运气好012---and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
真的吗?012---Really?
我讨厌跟你这么说...012---I hate to be the one to say it...
但你们两个得靠自己012---...but, honey, you two are on your own.
那是...你知道的  那是...012---Well, that's, you know, that's...
我们已经单独相处了20分钟 我们表现的很好012---We've been alone for the last 20 minutes and we're doing okay.
或许我们不会孤单的012---Besides y’know what? II—Maybe we won’t be alone, 
因为最近 我跟罗斯之间有些事发生012---Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross, you know?
我来医院前 我们还接了吻  你知道吗?012---And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss. You know?
或许那会是个开始012---So it might be the beginning of something.
 嗨  珍妮丝  嗨012--- Hey, Janice.  Oh, hi.
这个小家伙是谁?012---Oh. Who's this little guy?
 亚朗  那是你未来的岳父  不012--- Say hello to Aaron, your future soninlaw.  Oh, no, no. 
 我让你们一家人好好独处  好吧012--- I'm gonna leave you three alone. Okay.
天啊  你看到那孩子的鼻子了吗?012--- Man, you see the kid on that nose?
你知道我刚刚想到什么吗?012--- You know what I was thinking about? 
我们出门前的那个吻 那真的很特别吧?012---Um, that kiss before we left the apartment.That was something, huh?
对  真的是012---Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
但我们...我们得小心点012---But we, we gotta be careful.
我们...你知道的 我们不能让历史重演012---We You know, we can't let that happen again, you know?
对012---Right.
 我们不希望再发生那种事  对  所以我才会跟你提这件事012---We don't want to go down that road, do we?No. No, of course not. No, that's why I brought it up.
 他们没有汽水吗?  天啊  对不起012--- They didn't have any sodas?  Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
我忙着跟护士说话 完全忘了012---I was talking to this nurse. Completely forgot.
现在就已经开始了012---And so it begins.
她在里面吗?012---She in there?
对  护士正把她放在床上 那就是她012---Yeah. She's putting her down now. That's her.
你看  快看艾玛012---Look at Emma.
我无法决定 她长得像你或瑞秋012---I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
什么?你在开玩笑吗? 她美极了  完全是瑞秋的遗传012---Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.
对不起  这是我最后一次问你 你们两个为什么不结婚?012---I'm sorry. For the last time, why aren't you two together again?
不  我知道 因为你们没有到那个程度012---No, I know. Because you're not in that place.
那真的很棒 但事实上你们真的到了012---Which would be fine, except you totally are.
情况很复杂  好吗?012---It's complicated, okay?
对  那是真的012---Yeah, that's true. 
你一直都爱着她 你们生了一个孩子012---Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together.
没有答案是百分之百的正确012---There's no right answer.
我们曾经交往过 后来分手  后合后又分手012---Look, we've been together. Okay, and then apart.And then together, and then apart.
现在我们生了一个孩子012---And now we have a baby.
如果我们又复合 结果还是不行...012---It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out?
我不会对艾玛那么做012---I could never do that to Emma.
她来到这个世界 想像每件事都...这是我的想法012---I mean, she came into this world thinking everything Now me.
什么? 他们在水里放东西?012---What, do they put something in the water in this place?
瑞秋跟我 现在过得很好012---It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well right now.
我知道  如果你想更进一步 就得突破现状012---I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
 没错  对012--- Yeah, exactly.  Right.
或许你可以得到 你从15岁开始梦想的世界012---Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.
嘿012---Hey
我看到一个女人 同时在喂双胞胎母乳012---I just saw a woman breastfeeding both of her twins at the same time.
那真的很像怪物秀012---It is like a freak show up here.
 怎么了?  没事012--- What's the matter?  Nothing.
怎么了?嘿012---What is it? Hey?
 真的没事  我...  瑞秋  别这样  什么?012--- Really, it's nothing. I'm...  Rach, come on. What?
我一直在想 我跟宝宝要怎么独自活下去012---I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
你在说什么?罗斯呢?012---What are you talking about: "alone"? What about Ross?
拜托  他会有自己的家庭 双胞胎跟新波霸小姐012---Oh, please. He'll be with his real family. The twins and little Miss NewBoobs.
好吧 我看那个女人多久了?012---Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
我那么说...012---I'm just saying that, you know...
因为有一天 罗斯会认识别人...012---...someday Ross is gonna meet somebody...
他会去过自己的生活012---...and he's gonna have his own life.
对吧?012---Right?
我猜你说的对012---Yeah, I guess so.
我没有想过 我要自己抚养这个宝宝012---I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.
那真的很傻吧?012---Pretty dumb, huh?
你得听我说  听着012---Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
你永远都不会是一个人012---You are never, ever gonna be alone.
好吧? 我发誓我不会让那种事发生012---Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.
乔伊  喔  甜心 没有你我该怎么办?012---Oh, Joey. Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you?
你不必担心  好吗?012---You don't have to worry about that, okay?
你能再帮我 拿盒面纸来吗?012---Oh, honey, could you grab me my other box of tissues?
 就在罗斯的外套下面  没问题012---They're right on that chair under Ross' coat. Sure.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
乔伊012---Joey?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
好吧012---Okay.
（清洁间）012---
 那真的是太神奇了  我知道012--- That was amazing.  I know.
你知道我们很可能 已经永远地改变了我们的生活吗?012---Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever?
我们可能已经开始组成了我们的家庭012---We may have started our family.
九个月后我们可能会来这里...012---Nine months from now, we could be here...
生下我们的孩子012---...having our own baby.
要是没办法的话 我们得把宝宝生在桶子里012---And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
