专柜小姐的表情像是在说012---The saleswoman was looking at me like:

很有道理012---She had a point.

你怎么能让他对着你的胯下说话012---How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
他是在跟宝宝说话  原来如此012--- He's talking to the baby.  Oh! Okay.
好吧  因为当他说012---Okay, because when he said,
"我等不及要听到你说第一句话"012---"I can't wait for your first words"...
我想"这招不错"012---...I thought, "There's a trick."
我得走了  待会见012---Well, I gotta go, you guys. I'll see you later.
好吧  拜拜  拜012--- Okay. Bye.  Bye.

她知道你在拉夫罗兰工作..012---and she knows you you work at Ralph Lauren...
算了  绝对不行012---Forget it. No way.

你知道却一直没有告诉我们012---You knew and never said anything?
只知道跟我们说那些笨恐龙的事情012---With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?

我真的很想去听他星期五的演唱会012---I really wanna go to his concert Friday night,
但票卖完了012---but it's totally sold out.
我知道了  你为什么不去跟他要票012---I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets.

真的很实用012---They're very practical.
可以搭配连衣裙  短裙  长裤012---You can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...
你可以搭配短裤  站在街角012---You wear them with shorts on the corner
赚点钱来付靴子的帐单012---and earn the money to pay for them.
哇  好漂亮012---Wow, they're beautiful.
真的很磨脚012---They hurt so much.
什么  做这双靴子的人012--- What?  The guy who made these...

把它们送给我012---Give them to me.
我的脚好几年没有感觉了012---I haven't felt my feet in years.
不行  我花了大价钱买下来012---I can't. I spent so much money on them
我告诉钱德勒我会一直穿着012---and I told Chandler I'd wear them all the time.
我不能送人012---I can't just give them away.
你可以拿去退货换钱012---Then get your money back and return them.
我也不能那么做012---I can't do that either.
鞋底的地方有磨损012---The soles are already a little scuffed up,
内衬沾满了我的血012---and the insides are filled with my blood.
我刚刚去学校接了本012---Hey, I just picked up Ben from school.

我把他送回卡罗尔家了012---I dropped him off at Carol's.
总之  我没有要到门票012---Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna get those tickets, though.
不是吧  为什么012---Oh, no. Why not?
结果本跟史汀的儿子处得不好012---It turns out Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
怎么会呢012---How come?
很明显  史汀的儿子取笑012---Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that
本的妈妈们是女同志012---Ben's moms are "lesbenims."
等一下  如果他们处不好012---Wait, Ross. If they don't get along,
那你应该帮他们劝和012---then you should smooth things over.
让他们做好朋友012---Make them be friends.
你不能逼孩子们做朋友  当然可以012--- Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.  Sure you can.
给他们一些积木  让他们在游戏床里玩012---Give them some blocks. Put them in a playpen.
游戏床  本都七岁了  七岁了012--- Playpen? Ben's 7.  Your kid is 7?
他个头好小哦012---He's really small.
拜托你去要门票012---Please get the tickets.
抱歉  菲比  我办不到012---I'm sorry, Pheebs. I just can't do it.
不  你可以  史汀亲口说过012---Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
什么  罗斯可以012--- What?  Ross can.
听着  我很抱歉012---Look, I'm sorry...
罗斯可以012---Ross can.
菲比  罗斯可以帮我要到门票012--- Phoebe?  Ross can get me the tickets.
罗斯可以帮我要到门票012---Ross can get me the tickets.
她来了  未来的流行界超级巨星012---Here she is: Future fashion superstar.
乔伊  我还算不上...  我妹妹蒂娜012--- Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...  My little sister Dina.
蒂娜  很高兴见到你  嗨012--- Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.  Hi.
谢谢你答应见我012---Thanks so much for meeting with me.
乔伊告诉我很多关于你的事012---Joey's told me so much about you.
她好兴奋哦012---This is so exciting for her.
我让你们两个"流行大师"012---Well, I'll let you two "fashists"
坐下来好好谈正事012---get down to business.
好吧  蒂娜012---Okay. All right, Dina.
我们来谈谈  你可以考虑的012---Well, let's talk about the different areas of fashion...
服装界的不同领域012---...that you could get involved in.
让我看看  有设计部门012---Let's see, there's design.
但那得需要相关文凭012---But you may need a whole other degree for that.
销售部门不错  你可以旅行012---There's sales which is great, because you get to travel.
我不在乎流行服装012---I don't care about fashion.
我怀孕了  我知道你也是  你得帮帮我012---I'm pregnant. And I know you are too, so you gotta help me.
还有行销部门012---Then there's marketing.
怎么了  没事  我只是在打哈欠012--- What's wrong?  Nothing. I just was yawning.
别忘了今晚我公司要办派对012---Don't forget, my office holiday party's tonight.
我们今晚不一定要去  对吧012---Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing, do we?
我知道你不喜欢参加我公司的派对012---Sweetie, I know that you don't like my office parties,
但你可以穿你的新靴子012---but you can wear your new boots.
看吧  每件事都有它好的一面012---See? Every cloud has a supple leather lining.
今晚我不想穿靴子  为什么012--- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.  Why not?
我担心你老板看到以后012---Well, you know. I'm worried your bosses will see them
会觉得他们给你的薪水太高了012---and think they pay you too much money.
或是你的助理看到以后会要求加薪012---Or your assistant will see them and want a raise.
你以为我是在帮靴子订价的公司上班吗012---Do you think I work some kind of bootpricing company?
我已经挑好了我要穿的衣服012---I picked out this outfit I wanna wear,
靴子跟它不配012---and the boots don't go with it.
你说过这双靴子物有所值012---You said that you paid all that money
因为可以搭配短裙  连衣裙跟长裤012---because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
好吧  你要我穿靴子我就穿嘛012---Fine. If you want me to, I'll wear the boots.
事实上我要到卧室去试穿我的衣服012---In fact, I'll go into my room right now and try the outfit on.
穿着我的靴子参加圣诞节派对012---Christmas party in my boots!
我不能进去  我不敢告诉他012---I can't go in there. I can't tell him.
一定会没事的012---It's gonna be okay.
他一直都非常支持我012---He has been incredibly supportive of me.
如果他大发脾气012---And if he gets a little upset,
快把肉饼赛百味三明治拿给他012---that's what the meatball sub is for.
谢谢  好吧012--- Thank you.  Okay.
我的流行界女王们回来了012---Hey! It's my fashion girls.
怎么了  你为什么不坐下呢012--- What's wrong?  Why don't you sit down.
蒂娜有件事想告诉你012---Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
发生了什么事  是妈妈吗  她生病了吗012---What's going on? Is it Mom? Is she sick?
是爸爸的心脏出问题了吗012---Is it Dad's heart?
那是三明治吗012---Is that a sandwich?
妈妈跟爸爸没事  那是三明治吗012--- Joe, Mom and Dad are fine.  Is that a sandwich?!
乔伊  有件事你得知道012---Joey, there's something that you should know.
蒂娜012---Dina?
我怀孕了  什么012--- I'm pregnant.   What?
快给他三明治  给他三明治012---Now. Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
很明显  这是个误会  你不可能怀孕012---Obviously, this is a mistake. You can't be pregnant.
因为你得先做爱才会怀孕012---Because you have to have sex to get pregnant.
乔伊  我试着学你一样等到25岁再尝禁果012---Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25, like you did.
什么  蒂娜...012---What? Dina...
我不敢相信  你是个好孩子012---I can't believe this. You're the good one.
你念过大学  还念了两年012---You went to college! Both years!
是谁干的012---Who did this to you?
巴比·科索  但他是个很好的人012---Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.
我很喜欢他  他很好笑012---I like him a lot. He's real funny.
你因为"好笑"而怀孕012---You got pregnant for "funny"?
蒂娜  如果他很好笑  你只要笑就行了012---Dina, if he's funny, laugh!
我马上回来  你留在这里012---I'll be back in a little while. You stay here!
为什么  你要去哪里012---Why? Where you going?
我现在没法直视你012---I can't look at you right now.
我知道012---I know.
你在这里啊  本012---Oh, there you are, Ben.
菲比阿姨  你来这里做什么012---Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
我听说你跟班里的一个男生012---Well, I heard you're having a problem
相处得不太好012---with one of the boys in your class.
所以我就想过来  让你们坐下来012---So I thought I'd come down here and sit you both down,
好好地谈一谈  把问题解决掉012---have a little talk and make it all okay.
那个孩子叫做史汀的儿子012---Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.
杰克  我恨他  他是个混蛋012---Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.
本  有时候人们外表看起来像是混蛋012---Now, Ben. Sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside...
但他们有个名人爸爸012---...but they have famous fathers.
我得走了  我朋友道格在等我012---I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
你就跟这种孩子做朋友012---Him, you're friends with.
对不起  需要我帮忙吗012---Excuse me, can I help you with something?
对  我在找杰克的父母012---Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.
你是家长吗  我来找本012--- Are you with one of the students?  I'm with Ben.
你是本的妈妈012---Are you one of Ben's mothers?
我是本的妈妈012---I am one of Ben's mothers.
我是女同志012---I'm a lesbian.
我爸妈很难接受这种事012---It was difficult coming out to my parents.
我是珍妮·布恩  新来的老师012---Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon. I'm a new teacher here.
我只见过你的另一半卡罗尔012---I've only met your partner, Carol.
那么我就是苏珊012---That would make me Susan.
对  你要找杰克父母012---Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents
讨论他跟本的问题吗012---to discuss his problems he's having with Ben?
是啊  我觉得父母们012---Yeah, because I really do think the parents
应该坐下来好好谈一谈012---should sit down together and have a conversation.
对  我们就那么办吧012---Yeah, let's do that!
听起来很不错012---That sounds good.
我们应该坐下来谈一谈012---We should sit down and talk.
我和爱人卡罗尔跟史汀夫妇012---Just me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.
我要怎么联络他们012---How will I get in touch with them?
联络簿上有他们的电话号码012---Their number's on the contact sheet.
能给我一份吗012---Could I get a copy of that?
卡罗尔把它丢了  她弄丢了我们的联络簿012---Carol threw it out. She lost ours.
她真的很糊涂012---She's such a scatterbrain.
但天啊  她的屁股真是火辣性感012---But, man, what a hot piece of ass.
那场派对还不错012---You know, that party wasn't bad.
对  我不知道还有舞会012---Yeah. I didn't know there'd be dancing.
那真是个大惊喜012---That was a fun surprise.
我看不到计程车  或许我们该走回家012---I don't see a cab. Maybe we should walk.
不  我们不能走路012---No, we can't walk.
离地铁站只有15条街远  来吧012---It's 15 blocks to the subway. Come on.
你觉得我们可以从那个下水道孔012---Do you think we can get to the subway right there
直接爬到地铁站里吗012---if we climb through that manole cover?
什么事不对劲吗012---What's going on?
我走不动了  好吗012---I can't walk, okay?
买这双靴子是个天大的错误  什么012--- These boots were a huge mistake.  What?
你说得对  我不该买下来012---Okay, you were right. I never should have bought them.
害我的脚好痛  我的脚趾快断了012---They're killing me, one toe at a time.
我说得对  原来"对了"就是这种感觉012---So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.
我为什么觉得很不安012---It's oddly unsettling.
我们要怎么回家  背着走吧012---How are we gonna we get home? Maybe a piggyback ride?
来吧  好吧  等一下012--- Hop on.  Okay, wait, just give me a second.
我先把靴子脱掉012---Let me just get my boots off first.
天啊012---Oh, God.
亲爱的  我知道你很痛012---Honey, I know you're in pain right now,
但我却来了性致012---but I'm a little turnedon.
你会不会担心走路的时候012---Do you ever worry that you'll be walking
宝宝会掉出来012---and your baby will just slip out?
你念的哪所大学  蒂娜012---What college was that, Dina?
天啊  巴比012---Oh, my God. Bobby?
蒂娜  很高兴能见到你012---Hi, Dina. Good to see you.
乔伊  你在做什么012---Joey, what are you doing?
我只是在做我该做的事012---Just what needs to be done.
亲爱的亲友们  我们齐聚一堂012---Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...
乔伊  这太疯狂了012---Joey, this is crazy.
我在跟上帝说话  别打断我012---Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God!
我们说到哪里了012---Where were we?
你  蒂娜  愿意嫁这个人...  不012--- Right, okay. Do you Dina take this man...?  No!
你得嫁他  不  我不会嫁012--- You'll take him.  No, I won't!
这可由不得你  不  我就愿意这样012--- You don't get a say in this.  Yes, I do.
我听到了"我愿意"  已经完成一半012---I heard "I do." We're halfway there.
再来是你012---Okay. You.
好吧  乔伊  够了012---All right, Joey, that is enough!
虽然这个婚礼既漂亮又温馨012---Listen. As beautiful and moving as this ceremony is,
这是不合法的012---this is not legal.
他们没有结婚证书012---Okay. They don't have a marriage license
也没有证婚人012---and they don't have any witnesses,
而且新郎只穿了一只鞋012---and the groom only has one shoe.
对  他把另一只鞋脱了  用来打我012---Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
我该怎么办012---What am I supposed to do?
你应该了解他们是成年人012---You're supposed to realize they are adults
可以自己做决定012---and that can make their own decisions.
不  他们不能  他们笨到让自己怀孕012---No, they can't. They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
预防措施不一定有效对吧012---Contraceptives are not always effective. Right?
对  我们没有做预防措施012---Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
孩子们  别帮倒忙了012---Come on, kids, a little help here!
这个地方真的很棒012---Wow! This place is incredible!
史汀的笔...012---Sting's pen...
他送给了菲比012---...that he gave to Phoebe.
来吧  秘密通道012---Come on, secret passageway.
我是楚蒂  你一定是本的妈妈012---I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
不然我为什么要到这里来呢012---Why else would I be here?
请坐012---Why don't you sit down.
我知道杰克跟本最近处得不太好012---I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
我相信这个故事一定有两面说法012---I'm sure there are two sides to this story.
但我听到的是本是个"大笨蛋"012---But all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a "poopoohead."
抱歉  杰克的爸爸不会来吗012---I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?
对不起  杰克的爸爸没空012---Well, I'm sorry. Jack's father's not available.
好吧  我们可以改约到周五晚上012---Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule for Friday night,
八点见行吗012---perhaps at 8:00?
不  那样行不通012---No, I know that wouldn't work.
我丈夫要办演唱会012---My husband's in concert.
演唱会012---Concert. Yeah.
这让问题变得有点棘手012---That does put us in quite a pickle.
演唱会前后我都有事012---Because you see I'm busy before and after the concert,
演唱会的时间他又很忙012---and he's obviously busy during.
我想你跟我现在该来谈谈杰克跟本的事012---So I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
除非...012---Unless... Unless...
我愿意到演唱会上...012---Okay, I would be willing to go to the concert...
想一想孩子们的事012---...all the while thinking about the children, of course.
你是来要票的吗012---Are you here for tickets?
谢谢  四张就够了012---Thank you. Four would be great.
我不会把演唱会门票012---I'm not giving concert tickets
送给这样利用自己孩子的人012---to someone who'd use their son like this.
那正好  本不是我的儿子012---Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.
听着  我已经按下了静声警铃012---Look, I've just pressed a button triggering a silent alarm.
警察随时会到012---Any minute now, the police will be here.
"警察乐队"要来？012---The Police? Here?
他们要复合了012---A reunion?
好吧  已经走了十条街  只剩五条012---Okay, 10 blocks down. Five to go.
