哦  嗯012---Oh. Mm.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hey.
你应该尝尝这块起司蛋糕012---You have got to try this cheesecake.
你知道   我的牙不能吃太甜的东西012---Oh, you know, I'm not that much of a sweet tooth--
我的天啊  好香浓012---Oh, my God, it's so creamy. Oh.
那是我吃过的最棒的起司蛋糕012---Oh, my God. That's the best cheesecake I've ever had.
你在哪里买到它012---Where did you get this?
我到家时它就已经放在门口了  应该是有人寄给我们的012---It was at the front door when I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
钱德   收件人可不是你012---Chandler, this isn't addressed to you.
收件人是楼下的布雷曼太太012---This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.
小偷012---Thief.
我没看名子就打开盒子了012---I didn't read the box before I opened it...
盒子已经打开   就无法退还了012---...and you can't return a box after you opened it.
为什么  因为它太好吃了012---Why not? Because it's too delicious.
钱德  你偷了这个起司蛋糕   是犯错的012---Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
不  不  没关系的012---No, no, no, it is going to be okay...
因为布雷曼太太会免费再收到一个012---...because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one.
那可是   双赢啊012---And that way, we all win.
唯一的输家是大型起司蛋糕店012---The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate:
"妈妈的小面包店"012---"Mama's Little Bakery."
我觉得好难过012---I feel terrible.
我是个大坏蛋  大坏蛋  大坏人012---I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
对不起  你说什么012---Well, I'm sorry, what?
老友记  第七季  第11集  起司蛋糕012---Friends  S07E11 The One With All The Cheesecakes
行了  我得走了  我今天工作很忙012---All right, I should get going. Big day a work.
你们知道我怎么会昏迷不醒吗012---You know how I'm in a coma?
今天他们要帮我做检查   结果发现我没有脑死亡012---Today they do a test on me and it turns out I'm not brain-dead.
所以012---So--
聪明先生012---Ah-ah, Mr. Smarty-Pants.
没有脑死亡的是我演的角色012---It's just my character that's not brain-dead.
菲比  今晚的事没取消吧012---Hey, so Pheebs, still on for tonight?
当然  八点见  好的012---Absolutely. Okay. All right, I'll see you at 8. Okay.
什么东西八点见012---Oh, what's at 8?
我们约好吃晚餐012---Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey.
我们大约一个月会约一次去讨论你们的事012---We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
哇  我真的不知道012---Wow. Did not know that.
我能说  你今天看起来很漂亮吗012---May I say how lovely you look today?
那当然012---Duly noted.
那么  明天012---Oh, so for tomorrow...
你要租辆车一起开过去吗012---...do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
芬妮表妹的婚礼  明晚啊012---Cousin Frannie's wedding. It's tomorrow night.
你被邀请了012---You were invited?
不012---No.
我的天啊  我不敢相信012---Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
我以为他们只邀请了爸跟妈012---I mean I knew Mom and Dad were invited. I thought that was it.
七岁到九岁  芬妮跟我形影不离012---I mean, from the ages of 7 to 9, Frannie and I were inseparable.
或许九岁后  芬妮交了新朋友012---Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
或许这只是个误会  我打电话去问雪若阿姨012---Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Cheryl, okay?
或许他们邀请你了  只是请帖寄丢了012---Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
你可以打电话告诉她  我们小时候012---Yeah, well, you call her and tell her that, you know, when we were kids...
她的宝贝芬妮好几次想脱光我的衣服012---...her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay?
要不是我阻止了她  她也结不了婚012---If I hadn't stopped her, there probably wouldn't be a wedding to go to.
她也想脱我的衣服012---She tried to undress me too.
我以前会帮葛兰表弟脱衣服012---I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
乔瑟夫法兰西斯崔比亚尼   你回家了吗012---Joseph Francis Tribbiani, are you home yet?
我想他还没有回家  怎么了012---Um, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
我得告诉你   瑞秋凯伦葛林012---Well, I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Green.
我跟乔伊今晚有约  他留了这张字条给我012---I had plans with Joey tonight, and he left me this note.
"菲比  我没办法赴约  我有约会  待会再谈012---"Pheebs, can't make it. Got a date. Talk to you later.
大爹地"012---Big Daddy?
"大爹地"  那是我们之间的昵称012---"Big Daddy"? Oh, that's a nickname we were trying out.
你知道什么样的昵称  不会跟别人重复吗  "罗斯原子超人"012---Hey, you know what nickname never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."
乔瑟夫法兰西斯回来了012---Hey. Oh, here's Joseph Francis.
等一下  你干嘛叫我的全名012---Whoa, what are you middle-naming me for'?
我给你留了字条012---I left you a note.
那不是你放我鸽子的好理由012---So what? That doesn't give you the right to ditch me.
如果你有机会上床  当然可以取消跟朋友的约会012---Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there's a possibility for sex.
菲比  他说的对  这是规则012---Phoebe, he's right. That is the rule.
我无法接受这种事012---I don't accept this rule.
我们约好后  我期待你会出现012---When we make plans, I expect you to show up.
我不是你泡到马子前打发时间的代替品012---Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time till you meet someone better.
男女朋友来来去去   但朋友是一辈子的012---You know, boyfriends and girlfriends are gonna come and go, but this is for life.
我真的很抱歉   我不知道这对你来说那么重要012---Wow. I'm so sorry. I had no idea it would bother you this much.
是啊  它的确很重要012---Well, it does.
我可以弥补你吗012---Okay, can I make it up to you? Huh?
对不起012---I'm sorry.
明天晚上一起吃饭吧   我会自己付钱012---How about dinner tomorrow night? I'll pay for myself.
好吧  你说服了我012---Okay, you wore me down.
乔伊  既然你站在那边  就拿罐啤酒给 "罗斯原子超人"吧012---Hey Joe, while you're over there, how about another beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?
"罗斯" 它又回来了012---"Ross--" Is that back?
又有起司蛋糕012---Hi. The other cheesecake came.
他们又把它送到这里了012---They delivered it to the wrong address again.
把它送到楼下去   能有什么问题012---So just bring it back downstairs. What's the problem?
我不知道该怎么说再见012---I can't seem to say goodbye.
你是认真的吗  钱德  两天前我们才吃掉了一个蛋糕012---Are you serious? Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago...
你还想再吃啊012---...and you want more?
喔  我已经忘记它的味道了012---Well, I've forgotten what it tastes like, okay?
它是起司蛋糕   很好吃012---It was cheesecake. It was fine.
它又香又浓   酥酥的饼干012---It had a buttery, crumbly, graham-cracker crust...
还有味道非常浓郁012---...with a very rich...
但不油腻的奶油起司012---...yet light cream-cheese filling.
我的嘴巴全是口水012---Wow, my whole mouth just filled with saliva. Ahem.
你知道吗  忘了它  我们只是饿了012---Y'know what? Forget it. We are just hungry.
我们没吃午饭   所以头昏脑胀的012---We have not had lunch. We are just light-headed.
那我们去吃午饭吧   忘了那个起司蛋糕吧012---So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
我们得把它还回去  才不会被诱惑012---Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
好主意  你要去哪儿吃午饭012---Good idea. Where do you wanna go to lunch?
芝加哥小妈妈面包店012---Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
梅尔多米死了012---Mel Torme died.
乔伊  那是一年前的报纸了012---Joey, that paper's like a year old.
那就表示山姆古迪商店的大特卖结束了012---Oh, does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我终于收到雪若阿姨的回音012---So I finally heard back from Aunt Cheryl...
很明显地这不是误会012---...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.
婚礼现场座位有限012---Uh, there's limited seating in the hall--
座位有限  我是个瘦皮猴012---Limited seating? I am just one tiny person.
对  但是她不知道012---Well yeah, but she doesn't know that.
我是说上次她看到你012---I mean, the last time she saw you...
你会把婚礼用的小椅子给压垮012---...you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
"座位有限"  真是个烂藉口012---"Limited seating." That's such a lame excuse.
那不是她不邀请我的原因012---That's not the reason why she's not inviting me.
那有什么大不了的呢  我没办法观礼  只能去吃喜酒012---What's the big deal? I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception.
如果这能让你觉得开心一点012---And you know what? If it makes you feel any better...
琼安跟我只会去亮个相012---...Joan and I will just make an appearance...
我们会提早离开  以示抗议012---...and then we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
琼安  对  她是我的女伴012---Joan? Yeah, Joan Tedeschi, my date.
她是语言学系的助教012---She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department.
又高又漂亮012---Tall, very beautiful.
虽然有些人说  别挑太魁梧的女孩012---And despite what some people say, not broad-backed.
等一下  你收到的喜帖是 "请携伴参加"012---Wait a minute. You got "Ross Geller and guest"?
我没有被邀请  你却可以"携伴参加"012---I wasn't invited, and you got "and guest"?
对不起  我真的得解释罗斯的行为012---Uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross' behalf.
我想规则也适用在这里012---I think the rule applies here y'know,
因为他有机会跟魁梧女人上床012---Since he has a chance to get on broad-back--
她没有那么魁梧012---Not broad-back!
等一下  你得带我去012---Wait a minute. You're bringing me.
什么  我不能放琼安鸽子012---What? I can't cancel on Joan.
为什么  你没有听到吗012---Why not? Did you not hear me?
她是语言学系的助教012---She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department, okay?
她们很辣012---They're wild.
你到底为什么想去   是因为012---Why do you want to come anyway? Because...
她是我表妹012---...she's my cousin.
我是说  我们是一起长大的012---I mean, we grew up together.
我们是家人  你知道吗  对我来说很重要012---Family, you know? And all that's important to me.
好吧  我带你去012---Okay, all right. I'll take you.
我去打电话给琼安012---I'll go call Joan.
那真的是太棒了012---Oh, that's nice.
家人应该要出席的012---Family should be there.
这是她的婚礼  她一生中最快乐的日子012---This is her wedding. Happiest day of her life.
我们等着瞧吧012---We'll see. Ha, ha.
谢谢你请我吃午餐012---Well, thank you for lunch.
什么  等一下  我以为你付了钱012---What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay. I thought you paid.
很明显的  我们不必再掏钱买食物了012---So apparently, we just don't pay for food anymore.
我没有看错吧  它还在那里012---Do you see what I see? Huh! It's still there.
布雷曼太太一定是出去了012---Mrs. Braverman must be out.
她可能出城去了  或许几个月后才会回来012---She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
到时候  蛋糕一定坏了012---By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad.
不能让她回来时看到坏掉的起司蛋糕012---We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
她可能会中毒死掉   我不希望发生那种事012---No that could kill her. Well, we don't want that.
我们是在保护她012---No so we're protecting her.
我们把它拿走  但是要快点012---We should take it. But we should move quick.
为什么  我听到她在里面走动的声音012---Why? Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
快走  快走012---Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
天啊  是大卫012---Oh, my God, that's David.
谁  那个科学家大卫012---Who? David, the scientist guy.
我爱上了的那个大卫012---David that I was in love with.
那个去了俄罗斯伤了我的心的大卫012---David who went to Russia and broke my heart, David.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
只要一直念某人的名字  那个人就会转过身来012---Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
菲比  大卫012---Phoebe. David.
你在做什么   你不是在俄罗斯吗012---What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
我到城里来开会012---Yeah, I'm just in town for a conference.
天啊  你看起来美得出奇012---Um, God, you look phenomenal.
喔012---Well, ha, ha...
对012---Yeah.
你看起来也很棒  你剪了头发吗012---You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
对  我大概剪了三十次012---Yeah. Well, I got like 3O of them.
是012---Yeah.
听着  我要跟你坦诚一件事012---Um, look, I got a confession to make. Uh-huh.
我希望能在这里遇到你012---Um, I was hoping to run into you here.
我不知道该不该打电话给你  我只会在城里待几天012---I didn't know that I should call or not. You know, I was only in town a few days...
我不想打扰你的生活012---...and, you know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or anything like that,
我真的想见你012---But I really wanted to see you...
但我不知道你要不要见我012---...but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
我当然想见你  我常常想到你012---Of course I would want to see you. I think about you all the time.
真的吗  因为我也常常想到你012---Really? Because I think about you all the time.
真的吗  明斯克有一座雕像012---Really? There's a statue in Minsk...
让我常常想起你012---...that reminds me of you so much.
实际上  那是列宁的雕像012---I mean, um, it's actually of Lenin...
但有些角度看起来012---...but, you know, at certain angles... Yeah.
总之  今晚你想跟我共进晚餐吗012---Anyway, do you want to have dinner tonight?
好012---Yes.
喔  不012---Oh, no. Oh.
什么  我不能012---Uh, what? I can't.
我不敢相信  我已经有约了  今天不行  明天可以吗012---I can't believe I have plans. I can't. Can you do it tomorrow?
不行  再过几小时我就得离开了  我得赶回去012---Uh, no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the redeye.
听着  下次你到明斯克012---Well, listen, you know, next time you're in Minsk, uh...
菲比  我能跟你谈一谈吗012---Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second? Uh-huh.
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
我今晚跟乔伊有约  所以呢  他会谅解的012---Well, I have plans with Joey tonight. So? He'll understand.
不  他不会的  那根本不是重点012---No, he won't. And that's not even the point.
摩妮卡  我教训他不该见色忘友012---Monica, I made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends.
而现在呢   只因为可能是我真爱的人012---And now, you know, what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life...
明天就要回俄罗斯了  我就应该改变我的想法012---...comes back from Russia just for one night, I should change my beliefs?
我应该改变我的想法012---I should change my beliefs.
不  如果失去了原则   我什么都不会有012---No. No, no. If I don't have my principles, I don't have anything.
天啊  你太有说服力了012---God, you are so strong.
或许我可以赶快跟乔伊吃完晚餐  然后九点跟大卫见面012---Or I should rush through dinner with Joey and I could meet David at 9.
我的天啊  真的是太棒了012---Oh, my God, that is so good.
我吃饱了  但我知道  如果我现在停下来012---I'm full. And yet I know if I stop eating this...
我会后悔的012---...I'll regret it.
嘿  你们在吃什么012---Hey, what have you got there?
那是  喔012---Oh, it's, um...
豆腐蛋糕  你要吃一点吗012---it's tofu cake. Do you want some? Aah.
今晚你要做什么012---What are you doing tonight? Huh?
兄弟012---Uh. Dude. Dude.
对不起  我跟菲比有约012---Sorry. Uh, I got those plans with Phoebe.
真的  摩妮卡说她九点有约会012---Oh, really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9.
什么  今晚  摩妮卡是那么说的012---What? Tonight? That's what Monica said.
她教训了我一顿012---After she gave me that big speech...
却同时约了我跟她的男伴012---...she goes and makes a date on the same night she has plans with me'?
她想草草解决 "大爹地"012---I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy.
好了  我们的位置应该是这一桌012---Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
还座位有限  屁话012---Limited seating, my ass.
我们来看看  谁被邀请了012---Let's just see who made the cut.

你们跟新人是什么关系   我是芬妮以前的同事012---How do you know the bride and groom? I worked with Frannie.
以前的同事  以前012---Used to work with her. Used to.
我是她的亲戚却没有被邀请012---I'm a relative and I didn't get invited, okay?
我是她的血亲  血012---A blood relative. Blood.
别在陌生人面前提到 "血"012---Stop saying "blood" to strangers.
你呢  你跟快乐的新人是什么关系012---So how about you? How do you know the happy couple?
我们是他们的大学同学  现在是他们的邻居012---We went to college with both of them. And now we live next door.
好吧  你还够格012---Okay, you're fine.
你们要点菜了吗  是的012---Hey. Are you guys ready? Hey. Yes.
我要沙拉  特调酱汁  给我水就好了012---I will have a green salad, urn, house dressing and water's fine.
你呢  先生012---Okay. And for you, sir?
对  慢烤鲑鱼012---Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...

它已经烤好了012---It's already been roasted.
那我不要了  麻烦你  再告诉我一次今日特餐012---Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
乔伊  我们已经听了三次012---Oh, Joey, we've heard the specials three times, okay?
有烤肋排  鬼头刀鱼  跟特制龙虾饺子012---There's prime rib, mahi-mahi and a very special lobster ravioli.
事实上我们没有饺子了  那我们得重来一次012---Actually, we're out of the lobster ravioli. Oh, well, that changes everything.
你知道吗  菲比012---You know what, Pheebs? Uh-huh.
之前你说的话是对的  朋友太重要了012---You were right before. Friends are so important.
对  我很聪明  我知道012---Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
你知道我想做什么吗012---You know what I really want?
什么  我想花时间跟你长谈012---What? ls to have a long, long talk.
你知道吗   多告诉我一点人生道理012---You know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
可以点菜了吗  可以012---Any progress? Yes.
我要点龙虾饺子012---I will have the lobster ravioli.
天啊  乔伊  这得花一辈子的时间012---God, Joey, this is taking forever.
现在干嘛这么急   喔012---What's the rush? Well...
我有个约会012---...I just have, you know, an appointment.
它非常重要012---And it's very important.
怎么说012---What is it?

我约了一个男人012---...it's a date.
你约了男人  不  不  菲比  你一定弄错了012---A date? No, no, Pheebs, you must be mistaken...
因为你不能跟男人约会的同时012---...because you wouldn't schedule a date...
又跟朋友约吃饭012---...on the night you have plans with a friend.
别让我觉得内疚012---Come on. Don't make me feel badly about this.
不  我就是要那么做012---No, I'm gonna.
好吧  我跟那个女孩出去012---That's right. Yeah, you made me feel really guilty...
你让我觉得非常内疚012---...about going outwith that girl.
好像我做了什么可怕的事  菲比  现在你也那么做012---Like I did something terrible to you. Now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing.
我才不呢   这个完全不一样012---That's not the same thing. This is totally different.
我跟大卫有约  你还记得科学家大卫吗012---This is with David. Remember David, the scientist guy?
对我来说他非常特别012---Okay, he's very special to me.
那晚我约的女孩也很特别012---Okay, well, my girl from the other night was special.
她也是个科学家012---She was a scientist too.
是吗  她高中毕业012---She was? Well, she graduated high school.
随便啦  你知道吗012---Okay, whatever. Know what?
我没时间跟你讲道理012---I don't have time to convince you.
他只会在这里待4个小时  我得去见他012---He's only here for four hours and I'm gonna go see him.
好吧  对  对012---Fine. Fine! Yeah. Yeah.
你还在这里做什么  我说过了  龙虾饺子012---What are you still doing here? I told you, lobster ravioli.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我正要离开  我以为你不会来了012---Oh, I was just about to leave. I didn't think you were coming.
我绝不会错过这次约会012---Oh, I wouldn't have missed this. Ha, ha.
我很高兴你能来012---Well, I'm very glad you're here.
你是个绅士012---Oh, you're such a gentleman.
来吧  到我家去012---Come on, we're going to my place.
你想一个人独吞起司蛋糕012---Are you eating the cheesecake without me?
只要你现在能吹出口哨  我就给你一百块钱012---I will give you $100 to whistle right now.
你怎么可以不管我  一个人独吞012---How can you eat the cheesecake without me?
你会怎么做呢012---What are you gonna do?
告诉摩妮卡或乔伊  不  你得把一切都告诉他们012---Gonna run and tell Monica or Joey? No, you'd have to tell them what we did.
我们是甜点小偷  我们犯了法012---We are dessert stealers. We are living outside the law.
知道吗  我不能让你跟蛋糕独处012---You know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore!
