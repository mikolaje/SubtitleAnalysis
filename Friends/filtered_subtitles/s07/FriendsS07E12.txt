用炒菜锅012---With a wok?
我以为你要看我的书来帮助睡觉012---I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.

什么合约012---What contracts?
拜托  告诉我这是  你另一个我搞不懂的笑话012---Please tell me this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get. Heh, heh.
像什么012---Like what?
像是你把电话放在裤档012---Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
泰格  我很认真  这不好笑012---Tag, I'm serious. This isn't funny.
那些合约今天一定要寄出去012---Those contracts absolutely had to go out today.
瑞秋  对不起  你没给我什么合约啊012---Rach, I'm sorry, You didn't give me any contracts.

"今天一定要寄出"  在"今天"下面划了三道012---"Must go out today," and I underlined "today" three times.
然后我还在角落画了一颗心  因为我不想太像上司012---and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't wanna seem to bossy.
告诉你  你没有给我012---I'm telling you, You never gave them to me.
如果我们到办公室去  你会看到它在你的办公桌上012---Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office, you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
不  我会看到你很窘  因为它不在我的办公桌上012---No, I'd see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk.
也许我很窘  是因为你用裤档接电话012---Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you talk on the phone with your crotch.
你要现在去办公室  不012---You want to go to the office now? No.
算了  太晚了  我们不去办公室了012---Come on, it's late. We're not going down to the office.

我们一定要确定着陆在012---Yep. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land...
那块冰的右边  好吗012---...to the right of that patch of ice, okay?
不要撞到旁边的垃圾桶012---Not hit the dumpster on the other side.
试着避开中间那棕红色的什么怪东西012---and uh, and try to avoid that weird brownish-red stuff in the middle.
当你跳到下面以后012---So when you get down there...
上到屋顶让我进去012---...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
等下  要我去  你会没事的012---Oh whoa-whoa. Wait a minute. I have to do it? Yeah! Oh yeah, You'll be fine.
就像高空弹跳012---It'll be just like bungee jumping, you know?
但你不会回弹012---But instead of bouncing back up, you won't.
要是我的头撞到水泥地上呢012---Well, what if I smack my head on the concrete?
乔伊  我不想骗你  是有这个可能的012---Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey. It's a possibility.
我不知道  这样吧  掷铜板决定谁去012---I don't know Ross! Tell you what, let's flip to see who does it. okay?

你看得到是哪面吗  不行012---Can you see what it is? No.
你小心点  罗斯  不  不要这样012---Okay. Well, you be careful. No. No, Ross, stop.
我不跳012---I'm not jumping...
明天我要试镜  如果摔断腿就不能去了012---Okay, Look, I have an audition tomorrow, and I can't go if I break my leg.
我不跳  我有一个儿子  要是我死了他就没爸爸了012---Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son. Okay? He won't have a father if I die.
看来我们平手012---Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
好  这条线012---Okay, so this wire...
接到这条线  插到这儿012---...is connected to this wire, which plugs into here.
好  让哔声停止  我只要012---Okay, so to get the beeping to stop, all I have to do...
解决012---0Kay.
做得好  菲比012---Well done, Pheebs.
你到底要我怎样012---What do you want from me?!
你的牛奶来了  你想谈什么012---Okay, Here's your milk. What should we talk about?
什么  什么  什么012---What? What? What?
甜心  你在睡觉吗  抱歉  给你012---Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
好  你爱怎么找都行012---Okay. Feel free to look...
不过我告诉你  那些合约没在这张桌上012---...but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
你怎么可能知道  你看看有多乱  泰格012---Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag.
这就是我说的  你一定要有组织一点012---I mean, This is what I'm talking about. You have to be more organized.
有报纸  有杂志  你啊012---You've got newspapers, you've got magazines, you-Oh!
这小妞是谁012---And who's this chippy?
对你来说太幼稚一点吧   随便啦012---A little young for you, but whatever.
是我妹012---It’s my sister.
真的  牙套好可爱012---Really? Very cute braces.
你知道吗  重点是  泰格  开始找吧012---Anyway, you know what? The point is, Tag, start looking...
你会在你桌上找到那些合约的012---...because you're gonna find those contracts on your desk.
你想像是什么时候给我的  早上还是下午012---So when do you imagine you gave them to me? Morning or afternoon?
下午  塞纳先生午餐后  进来我办公室012---In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch...
放在我桌上  我贴了一张随手贴在上面012---...he put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-it on it...
写着012---...that said:
"今天一定要寄出"012---"Must go out today."
请你继续找  好吗012---So you just keep looking in there, all right?
不在这里012---Not here.
奇怪012---Puzzler.
真奇怪012---Bit of a puzzle.
你去复印室找一找  也许你放在那里012---Why don't you check the copy room? Maybe the contracts are in there.
我怎么可能放在那里  我不知道  泰格012---How could I have left them in the copy room? I don't know Tag!
你的私处怎么可能打电话012---How can your genitals make phone calls?
好吗  这不是个完美的世界  请你去找一找012---Okay? It's not a perfect world. Just go, please?

我饿死了  晚饭时我在想什么啊012---Man, I'm starving. What the hell was I thinking at dinner?
"你要汤还是沙拉"  两样都要  永远都两样都要012---"Do you want soup or salad?" Both, always order both.
我看了半天  我想没人在家012---You know, I'm looking, and I don't think anyone's home here.
我说我们打碎窗户012---I say we just break the window...
爬进去012---...crawl through...

"菲比布非财物  不是摩妮卡的"的毯子012---"Property of Phoebe Buffay, not Monica."
你有搜查令吗012---Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant?

看起来还好远  没有那么远  跳就是了012---It still looks pretty far. It's not that far. Just drop.
不要催我012---Do not rush me!
我的裤子开始下滑  我没穿内裤012---Ross, you should know that my pants are starting to come down, and I'm not wearing any underwear.
哇啊012---Whoa!
我的脚踝  我伤到我的脚踝012---Ow! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle!
我想我扭到了  这里有个硬币012---I think I twisted it when-Ooh, a quarter!
真的是你的最佳表现啊012---That really was some of your best work.
