《老友记》 前情提要012---Previously on Friends:
你居然不能去  是啊012---I can't believe you won't be there. I know.
为什么不能请两天假012---Why can't you take a couple of days off?
我不行  这是我的婚礼012---Because I can't. This is my wedding.
真想赶快看到婚礼场地  她父母就在那里结婚012---So,I can't wait to see this place you're getting married! Emily's parents got married here.
你绝对没看过那么美的房子  就在012---It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. It's right over...
天哪012---Oh, my God!
我只知道延期是不可能的012---The only thing I understand is postponing is not an option.
我跟你讲  我们不会结婚了012---I tell you, this wedding is not gonna happen.
要是你不喜欢  我们就改地点  改时间  真的没关系012---If you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place or any other time. Really, it's fine.
这样很完美012---It's perfect.
我要去伦敦  什么012---I'm going to London. What?
有人说 "我愿意" 才算结束012---It's not over until someone says, "I do."
我愿意  我愿意  我愿意012---I do! I do! I do!
瑞秋  不012---Rachel, no!
华森公馆012---The Waltham residence.
是艾蜜莉的父母家吗012---Hi, is this Emily's parents' house?
我是管家012---This is the housekeeper speaking.
还有  小姐  讲电话不能这样讲012---And, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.
先表明身份012---First one identifies oneself...
再请你想找的人过来012---...and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
我是菲比布非012---Um, this is Phoebe Buffay.
我是想麻烦你012---I was wondering, please...
如果不是很麻烦的话012---...if it's not too much trouble, please...
我能和艾蜜莉华森小姐通话吗012---...um, might I speak with Miss Emily Waltham, please?
华森小姐去排练餐会了012---Miss Waltham is at the rehearsal dinner.
嘲弄别人的口音是不礼貌的  再见012---And it is not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
不  我会有礼貌  我发誓012---No, no! I'll be nice, I swear.
可以把电话给我吗012---Could you just give me their number?
我恐怕没有权利泄露这个信息012---I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
有人正要去破坏婚礼  我得警告他们012---Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody,
你不给我号码  我就杀到伦敦012---alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there...
把你一脚瑞到新咕噜肯夏去012---...and I'll kick your snooty ass all the way to New Gloukenshire!
喂  喂012---Hello? Hello? Oh!
她知道我说到做到012---Ooh, she knew I could kick her ass.

当然  我明天婚礼上会正式敬酒012---Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding,
这里也就是随便敬敬012---so this is kind of my little toast, or Melba toast, if you will.
我跟罗斯认识很久了  他第一次交女朋友我都知道012---Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend.
我以为他们很顺利  直到那天他替她充气012---And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her.

不  不  出事了  瑞秋跑去伦敦了012---No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
太好了012---Oh, great!
一点也不好  她要去告诉罗斯她爱他012---No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
但是罗斯爱艾蜜莉012---But he loves Emily.
我知道012---I know that!
你得阻止她  她会破坏婚礼012---You have to stop her. She's going to ruin the wedding.
好012---Okay.
我该做的都做了012---Okay, so I'm done my part, okay.
现在该你负责  我现在没担子了  对吧012---It's your responsibility now, The burden is off me, right?
对012---Right.
说说那个伴娘吧012---So tell me about this girl.
你看见摩妮卡了吗012---Hey. Have you seen Monica?
我没有看见摩妮卡012---I'm not seeing Monica.
什么  什么012---What? What?
我们得找到她012---Look, we gotta find her.
菲比说  瑞秋要来向罗斯表白012---Phoebe just called! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him.
天哪  没错  所以要找到摩妮卡012---Oh, my God. I know. That's why we got to find Monica!!
你知道她在哪里吗  不知道012---You know where she is? No, okay?
你在逼问什么  干脆拿灯照我的眼睛算了012---What's with the third degree? Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?
结果我发现我的一切举动012---...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing....
向约书亚求婚  骗罗斯说我要忙012---...proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. ...
都只是一种表达方式012---...was all just a way of... Oh! Oh! Oh!
抱歉  可以打断一下吗012---Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, Can I interrupt?
你真是个很糟糕  很糟糕的人012---You know I just want to say that you are a horrible, horrible person.
你说什么012---Ehh, Pardon me?
你说你爱这个人  却要去破坏他的大喜之日012---You say you love this man, You're about to ruin the happiest day of his life.
我不得不同意你朋友菲比的话012---I have to agree with your friend Pheebs.
这是个很糟糕  很糟糕的计划012---This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
但他必须知道我的感受  为什么012---But he has to know how I feel. But why?
他爱这个艾蜜莉  你这么做绝对没好处012---He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
我觉得你错了012---Well I think you're wrong.
糟糕012---Oh, no!
还有  你们当时显然是分手了012---And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
跟仙境一样012---It's like a fairyland.
是啊  很恐怖吧012---I know. It's horrible, isn't it?
我好喜欢  希望我的婚礼也能这么美012---I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
我觉得  有些话就别接了012---Ha! I just hope... You can let some go by.
摩妮卡012---Psst. Monica.
好了  我们要开始提防瑞秋了012---Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel.
我守前门  你守后面那个大洞012---I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building
罗斯那里有钱德看着012---and I got Chandler covering Ross.
我干嘛管钱德在哪里012---Why would I care where Chandler is? Heh.
你知道…012---You know, uh...
有的时候我根本不喜欢钱德012---...sometimes I don't even like Chandler.

你好吗012---How you doing?
没得商量  我们不会付酒窖的钱012---There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
你们总得折衷一下012---You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
嘿  你再这么逼我  我就踹你的屁股了012---Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
怎么了  没事  一切都在掌握中012---What's going on? Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
你想干一架  是这个意思吗  想干一架012---You want a piece of me? Is that what you're saying? You want a piece of me?

天哪  你真美012---My God! You look beautiful.
