我刚刚告诉我妈   帮她的晚会准备食物012---I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
为什么这样做   因为我需要钱012---How come? -Because I need the money
而且我那点仅存的自尊  不要也罢012---and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
别这样  这是一件好事012---Come on, I think this is a good thing.
老妈若不是觉得你厨艺精湛  才不会雇你呢012---I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
你犯不着替她说好话   她又听不见012---You don't have to stick up for her. She can't hear you.

瑞秋  昨天很有趣  我在街上碰见乔安娜了012---Hey, Rach, funny story. I, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
我的老板  乔安娜  很惨吧012---My boss, Joanna? That must have been awkward.
不  实际上  她只是问我是否想一起喝一杯012---Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
你没答应她吧012---You, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
没有  没有012---No! No!
嘿  瑞秋012---Hello, Rachel.
起初我没答应012---Well, not at first.
她在这里做什么012---What is she doing here?
上次你跟她约会以后  还说她是个反应迟钝的笨女人012---I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
我过早对她下结论了012---Well, I think I judged her too quickly,
现在我跟她可以做进一步的发展012---and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
上次我差点被开除  你必须跟她绝交  立刻012---Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
我又不是天天有艳遇012---Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me!
通常我都是独处的012---I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
钱德  答应我012---Chandler! Promise me.
跟她断交012---you will end this now.
好吧   我答应   谢谢012---Okay, I promise, I'll end it. Thank you.
希望你知道  我为了你牺牲很大012---I hope you know what I'm giving up for you

你祖母死后  我们发现时  她的手就这样012---Ha. It's what your grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
我想问你一个问题012---Let me ask you a question.
为什么你要雇我012---Why did you hire me?
理查德一直说他晚会的派对餐点很棒012---Well Richard raved about the food at his party...
当然  那时你和他睡过012---of course you were sleeping with him.
而且我听说  在那个女同性恋的婚礼上012---Then I heard the food at that lesbian
你的菜也大受欢迎012---wedding was very nice.
我假定你没和那里的什么人睡过012---I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there.
所以  我认为你可能有两把刷子012---Though, at least that would be something.
天啊  你听到了吗012---Oh, my God! Did you hear that?
她雇我是因为  她认为我很优秀012---She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
我没听见012---I didn't hear that.
她不是可怜我012---Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity.
不是想在朋友面前刁难我012---it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends,
她是真的觉得我行012---she actually thinks I'm good.
喔   如果你是个同性恋就太酷了012---Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
下午好  你是一家之主吗012---Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
你有大百科全书吗012---Do you currently own a set of encyclopedias?
没有  你可以查查分类广告  卖什么的都有012---No, but try the classifieds. People sell everything in there.
实际上  我不是要买  我是要卖012---Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling.
我想问你一个问题012---Let me ask you one question.
朋友们聊天的时候012---Do your friends ever have a conversation...
你只能跟着点头   却搞不懂他们在说什么012---and you just nod along, even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
我告诉你  这是违反宪法的012---I'm telling you, it's totally unconstitutional.
没错  完全同意012---I hear you. Yeah it is. I totally agree.
我觉得他应该得诺贝尔奖012---I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
才怪012---No.

抱歉  对不起012---Excuse me. I'm sorry.
这两分半钟   你什么也没有说012---You haven't said anything for about two minutes.
你有兴趣吗012---Are you at all interested?
有  有… 进来012---Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah. Come on in.
怪了  什么012---That's weird. What?
你的指甲012---Your nails.
我知道  我从不戴假指甲的012---I know, I never wear fake ones.
我怕咬指甲被我妈抱怨012---I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
不  我的意思是  你现在只有九个指甲012---No, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
等一下012---Wait a minute.
刚才还是十个012---I had them when I put...
天啊  在咸派饼里012---Oh, my God! It's in the quiche!
天啊  别着急012---Oh, my God! Okay, don't panic.
我现在就去商店  帮你买一套新指甲012---I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails.
神不知鬼不觉  你看起来还是很美012---No one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great.
但是问题是  他们会吃到那只的012---Oh. Oh, it's because they're gonna eat... That's the problem.
亲爱的  不要咬你的指甲012---Honey, don't bite your nails.
好吧  别惊慌012---Okay, please don't freak out.
不过有个咸派里  有我的一片蓝指甲012---but, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups.
谁也不知道是哪一个杯子012---And there's no way to know which one.
找到指甲可以中大奖012---And whoever finds it wins the prize!
我没惊慌012---I'm not freaking out.
那你笑什么  没事  你爸输给我5美元012---Then why are you laughing? It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
什么  你打赌我会掉一个指甲吗012---What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
别傻了   我打赌我会用上这个012---Don't be silly. I just bet that I'd need these.
冰冻宽面条012---Frozen lasagnas? Mm.
你赌我会搞砸012---You bet that I'd screw up?
"你雇我是因为我很优秀"  都是假的...012---So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
不  不  不  那是真的012---No, that was all true.
准备备用食物  只是怕你又"很莫妮卡"012---This was just in case you "pulled a Monica."
你答应过外恩博格教授   不再这么说了012---You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
拜托  有点幽默感嘛012---Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour
你总是不懂得自嘲012---you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
没错012---That's right.Ha, ha.
我妈从没信任过我  好好笑012---My mom doesn't have any faith in me. Oh, that's hilarious.
我不觉得好笑012---I don't get it.
不   我信任你012---No. I have faith.
不   你只是有烤宽面条012---No. You have lasagnas!
报废的咸派烤好了012---The ruined quiches are ready.
怎么没有...分手的感觉012---It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.

好吧012---Okay!

我光溜溜走出去  会有人朝我扔东西012---When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.

你是012---Yeah, you are.
好调皮012---Saucy!
2分钟后我就回来012---I'll be back in two minutes.
你就这样离开我012---You're going to leave me like this?
你就乖乖地坐在这里等我  感觉让人兴奋012---Knowing you're here waiting for me. I think that's kind of exciting.
好的  但如果你不能马上回来012---Okay. But if you don't come back soon...
我也不能怎么样012---there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
我给你带了蛋白杏仁饼干012---I brought you back a macaroon!
太好了  我会把它贴在屁股上012---Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
奇怪  她把门锁上了012---That's weird. She locked the door.
你知道为什么吗  里面有圣诞节奖金名单012---You know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there.

手拷的钥匙在门的后面012---The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door.
你可以乖乖012---Could you be a doll...

顺便说一下  你的长裤套装很可爱012---And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
你发誓你和她分手了012---You promised you would break up with her.
我是和她分手了  只不过她分得很狂野012---I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
你都没想过  这样会破坏我的事业吗012---And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
我想过啊012---It did enter my mind.
但是情况有变   打开手铐012---But then something happened that made it shoot right out.
钱德  你作茧自缚  你自己想办法012---You know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
别... 我开不了手拷012---No..I can't get myself right out of them!

快点  你必须帮我012---Come on, you have to unlock me,
她要好几个小时后才能回来  我很冷  而且012---she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and...

我会被炒鱿鱼的012---and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
我会编个故事   我很擅长说慌012---I'll make something up! I'm good at lying!
实际上我借过你的随身听012---I actually did borrow your Walkman!
我无法解释  她知道我有她办公室的钥匙012---No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office.
我得把你铐回去012---I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
噢  想都别想012---Oh, I don't think so.
这样好多了012---Well, this is much better.

"耶  他很莫妮卡"012---"Yeah, he pulled a Monica." You know?

反正你都会有麻烦  明白吗012---Look, you're in trouble either way! Okay?
她回来看见我被锁在这边012---If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair...
知道你进来过  还不如让我走012---she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
我帮你打扫一个月浴室   还是洗不干净012---What if I clean your bathroom for a month? It still wouldn't be clean.

索菲知道  莫妮卡和菲比也知道012---Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
她们怎么会知道  我给她们打电话012---How do Monica and Phoebe know? I called them.
如果她们问我看见了什么012---And when they ask me what I saw...
