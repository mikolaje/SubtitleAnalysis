你朋友触犯了这个法案012---Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it.
我一直没出声  不过现在我不用再做好人了012---I've been a nice guy up until now, but, I don't need this grief.
我要去告诉房东012---I'm gonna call the landlord...

不得与客人乱来...012---Yeah, no fooling around with clients...
时刻准备着012---and always be prepared.
后一句是童子军说的  不过说得通012---Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
你为什么不把他转给别人012---Why don't you just give him to somebody else?

英雄  事情怎样了012---My hero! What happened?
我下去告诉他  说谁也不能那样对我朋友012---Well, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that.
最好能上来道个歉  待会儿见012---and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
等等012---Wait a minute.
那他怎么说012---What did he say?
他说他不会来道歉  因为你们住在这里是违法的012---He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally.
相反他要把你们赶出去  待会儿见012---so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
