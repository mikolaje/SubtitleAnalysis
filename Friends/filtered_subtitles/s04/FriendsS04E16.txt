怎么了012---What is it?
没什么  我不知道要吃什么012---Nothing. I can't find anything that I want to eat.
吃什么都会让我恶心012---Everything makes me nauseous.
我告诉你  怀孕可不像吃蛋糕那么简单  哇啊  蛋糕012---I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake. Oh, cake.
不行012---No.
真可怜  天啊012---Aw, honey, I'm sorry. God.
什么香味  是浴室传出来的012---Ooh, what is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom.
你倒是多了些怪癖012---Wow, pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
是我  菲比012---Yeah. It's me. It's Phoebe.
听着  这里有我想吃的东西  什么012---Listen, there's something in here I want to eat. What?
什么味道这么香012---What smells so good?
是洗发香波吗  是石榴香味012---Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
不是012---No.
等下  等等012---Ugh. Oh, wait, wait.
是我的红肠三明治吗012---Is it my bologna sandwich?
对  对  没错012---Yes, yes, yes.
这孩子居然想吃红肠  可能他想让我吃肉012---I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna. The baby wants me to eat meat.
我不能吃肉  等等012---I can't eat meat. Uh, wait, wait.
也许是腌黄瓜012---Maybe it's the pickle.
老友记  第四季  第16集  假派对012---Friends S04E16  The One With The Fake Party
你在写什么012---What are you writing?
约书亚明天要来012---Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow...
因为我没胆儿约他出来012---...and since I don't have the guts to ask him out...
所以我打算卖他件衣服   然后把这纸条塞进口袋里012---...I'm gonna sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
是吗  是012---Oh, yeah? Oh.
"约书亚  有空打电话给我  你这样的男人…012---"Joshua, give me a call sometime. Guys like you...
…永不过时"012---...never go out of style."
你都扔了哪些话啊012---What did you throw away?
伙计们  嗨  你们干什么去了012---Hi, guys. Hey, what have you guys been up to?
我们去Cupert-Hewitt博物馆  看维多利亚时期门把展012---Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs at the Cooper-Hewitt museum.
没带-我012---Without me?
是我舅舅拖我们去的   结果很有意思012---My uncle dragged us there, but actually it turned out to be interesting.
是啊  那些门把很华丽012---Yeah. They were so ornate and beautiful.
我是说  你们看012---I mean, look at that.
我不知道英国的国情012---I don't know how museums work in England...
但这里  不能顺手牵羊012---...but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
这是礼品部的012---I, uh... I got it from the gift shop.
那里没什么防盗措施012---They have really lax security there.
开个玩笑012---It's a joke.
拜012---Bye.
我该走了  再见  我会想你们的  拜拜012---Right, I've got to be off. I'll see you. Bye-bye, then.
再见012---Bye.
看起来你们相处得很愉快嘛012---Wow. Hey, you guys seem to be having a good time.
对啊  她人很棒   而且很有趣012---Oh, yeah, she is amazing, and she's so much fun.
还有  你知道吗  跟她在一起时  我也相当有趣012---And you know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun.
我甚至报名学开直升机012---I even signed up for helicopter classes.
她过两天就走了  我其实不用这样012---She's leaving in two days. I don't have to do it.
过两天  你一定很失落吧  是啊012---Aw, two days? You must be bummed. Yeah.
她非回伦敦不可012---She's got to go back to London.
但你知道吗  我一开始就有心理准备012---But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start.
我们都知道我们彼此只有这两星期  仅此而已012---We both knew we had two weeks together and then that's it, you know?
我的每段恋情也都是这样012---Hey, that's what all my relationships are like.
对  但是罗斯他们是"双方"都知道  只有两星期而已012---Yes, but in Ross' case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
菲比  嗨012---Pheebs, hey.
宝宝  好啊  好啦  我知道012---Hello, hello. Yeah, I know. Yeah.
这孩子就喜欢肉012---So the baby is totally craving meat.
下午我想用素汉堡骗骗他012---This afternoon, I tried tricking it.
我做了个素汉堡  就是让他以为他吃到肉了012---I made it a soy burger so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.
然后  我又恶心了012---You know? And I got nauseous.
也许是因为素汉堡太难吃012---Well, maybe that's because soy burgers suck.
怀孕吃东西真难啊012---Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.
但你有一种孕妇的光彩012---Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant-lady glow.
真好听  你要是吐一个早上也会红光满面的012---Oh, that's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
这是你想要的风衣012---Okay. Uh, here's that trench coat you wanted.
太好了012---Oh, great. Great.
很舒服012---Wow, yeah, it's comfortable. Yeah.
这个可以用来装变态012---Man, you could really flash somebody in this thing.
不行  出了店门012---Ha, ha. They don't want you to put your hands in the pockets...
才能把手放进口袋里012---...until you are out of the store.
为什么012---Why not?
因为012---Well, because
有很多人012---we get a lot of
你知道  装变态毁了好多人012---You know, they ruin it for everybody.
我知道012---I know.
你知道  我昨晚穿那件喀什米尔毛衣去约会012---You know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
我离婚后第1次的约会012---Oh. It was the first date since the divorce.
恭喜  你爱她吗012---Well, congratulations. So do you love her?
她还不错  不过我也发现012---No, no, no. She's nice, but, you know, it made me realize...
我还没有心情约会  你明白012---...I'm just not ready to be dating, you know?
对012---Huh.
这样012---Well, uh...
真有意思012---That's, uh... That's interesting.
那是什么  就是个防盗磁条012---What was that? Oh, that's just an antitheft device.
那这是什么012---Then what's this?
那个你也需要  因为很明显  贼会把它撕掉012---Well, you need that too, because obviously a thief could just tear this up.
听着  今天晚上有个派对012---Listen, we have to have a party tonight.
其实是5分钟后开始  所以大家都要取消别的计划012---We have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
你说什么  是啊  怎么回事012---What? Yeah, what's going on?
我们要帮艾蜜莉搞个惊喜告别晚会012---We have to have a surprise bon-voyage party for Emily.
其实是为了约书亚012---But it's actually for Joshua.
他说他还没有心情约会012---Look, he said he's not ready to date.
所以我得邀请他参加派对  才能在工作之外见到他012---So I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside work.
现在我创造了个绝好的机会来勾引他012---And now I have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.
同样我也有机会见到约书亚  很想当面警告他012---Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him...
但是艾蜜莉和我不能参加  好吗012---...Emily and I aren't gonna be here, all right?
她会来说声再见012---She's gonna come by first to say goodbye.
我今晚还有个完整的计划  对不起  没戏唱了012---And then I've got a whole special evening planned. So sorry. No party.
有人吗  惊喜012---Hello? Surprise!
惊喜  惊喜012---Surprise!
从来没有人给我办过惊喜派对012---No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before.
这都是罗斯的主意012---Well, it was all Ross' idea.
你真好012---You're so sweet.
我真的很惊喜啊012---And I'm so surprised.
你真的没料到012---You really didn't know?
约书亚在那边  你怎么在这边012---Why are you over here if Joshua's all the way over there?
啊  因为我想玩玩欲擒故纵012---Uh, because I'm trying to play hard-to-get.
快  快点他看过来了  说句好笑的话012---Oh, quick. He's looking over here. Say something funny.
比如012---Like what? Ha-ha-ha.
什么事这么好笑012---What's so funny?
我说了个 "比如"012---I said, "Like what?"
真深奥012---Now that's a thinker.
你知道吗  玩欲擒故纵不好使啊012---Okay, you know what? This playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.
把樱桃给我  好…012---Uh, hand me those cherries. Okay.
好012---Okay.
嗨012---Hi. Hey.
要吃樱桃吗  不要  谢谢012---Care for a cherry? No, thanks.
你知道吗  我可以用舌头把樱桃梗打结012---You know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
你还好吗012---You okay?
没事吧012---You all right?
我们差不多得赶快走了012---So we should probably get going soon.
但是派对才刚刚开始啊012---Oh, but the party's only just getting started.
我们得在15分钟内   赶去"四季" 喝酒012---Yeah, but we have to be at The Four Seasons for drinks in, oh, 15 minutes.
然后再去广场饭店吃晚饭012---And then, uh, you know, then the Plaza for dinner.
那你为什么还在同一时间还办派对啊012---So why did you plan a party at the same time?
不  不  不是的012---No, no, no. Ha, ha.
其实  美国的惊喜派对时间都很短012---Actually, American surprise parties are very short.
一般都是 "惊喜"   然后就 "我好惊喜  再见"012---It's usually, "Surprise!" Then, "Oh, my God, I'm so surprised. Goodbye."
但是我觉得好好玩012---Ross, I'm having such a great time.
你妹说你以前会假扮成老太太012---Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dressed up like old ladies...
举办 "虚拟世界" 茶会012---...and host make-believe tea parties.
摩妮卡说的  是吧012---Monica said that, did she?
好赞  你接下来要放什么012---Oh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
放点蒜味肉肠  好棒012---A little salami. Ooh, yeah. Yeah.
那蒜味肉肠上面呢012---Then, um, what goes on top of the salami?
燻牛肉  太赞了012---Pastrami. Oh, yeah.
你真是天才012---You're a genius.
能帮我拉下拉链吗012---Can someone give me a hand with the zipper.
往上拉012---Up.
你换衣服  对  我需要我的幸运裙012---You changed? Yeah, I just needed my lucky dress.
幸运是指露更多乳沟  对我管用012---And "lucky" means "more cleavage"? Does for me.
你们看他啊  这么可爱012---Oh, God, look at him. He's so cute.
我真想过去  抓着他  然后亲他012---I just want to go over there and grab him and kiss him.
我怎么才能又亲他  又不让他知道我喜欢他012---How could I kiss him without letting him know that I like him?
我知道怎么能办到  脱胸罩012---Hey, I know how you can get him. Take off your bra.
什么012---What?
在 "浑身是劲" 里   是"闪舞"里012---There was a scene in Footloose... Flashdance.
对  那个水电女工  她是焊接工012---Yeah, yeah. Yeah, with that plumber girl? She was a welder.
你在电影里吗012---Were you, like, in the movie?
反正  她从衬衫里脱掉了胸罩012---Anyway, she takes off her bra under the shirt...
然后从袖子里拉了出来012---...and pulls it out the sleeve.
看着非常性感  还很有品位012---Very sexy. And classy.
不然如果你想亲他  可以用槲寄生树（圣诞节传统  在槲寄生树下接吻）012---Or if you wanna kiss him, um, you could use mistletoe.
现在不是圣诞节012---It's not Christmas.
转瓶子  他不是小孩子了012---Or spin the bottle. And he's not 11.
谢谢你们真用心  想的真周到012---Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
你们要走了012---You're leaving?
对  我们还有别的事  我想我也要走了012---Yes, we have something we have to get to. Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna take off too.
先别走  留下来  你们得留下012---No, you guys, you can't leave yet. You have to stay.
我们还准备了重头戏012---We've got the whole big thing planned.
什么重头戏012---What big thing?
像这样这么转瓶子012---So, Spin-The-Bottle works like this.
我转瓶子012---I spin the bottle.
指向阿甘  我就要亲阿甘012---Lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther.
就这样012---All right.
谁要先012---Who wants to go first?
我先012---I'll go.
欢迎来到美国012---Welcome to America.
好012---All right.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
连续两次  来个舌吻吧012---Oh, my gosh. Two in a row. You gotta use your tongues now.
再来012---All right.
这概率  太巧了012---What are the odds? What are the odds?
够了  我们012---Okay, that's enough, you know. Ha, ha.
让别人玩吧012---Let's let someone else play.
你不想玩  干嘛来参加派对啊012---Hey, if you didn't want to play, then why'd you come to the party?
好了  该我了012---Okay, my turn.
是你012---Oh! Look at that.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
天哪  宝宝踢我了012---Oh, my God. The baby just kicked.
没事  他踢了一次  还会踢第二次012---It's okay, it's okay. If it kicked once, it'll kick again.
好吧  大家要记住刚才坐的位置012---All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
有虫012---It was a bug.
不管我多想吃012---It doesn't matter how much I'm craving it.
你知道我为什么不吃肉  因为这是冷血谋杀012---You know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's cold-blooded murder.
好012---Okay.
我的三明治上有菲比012---There's a Phoebe on my sandwich.
菲比  你干什么012---Phoebe, what are you doing?
我忍不住012---I can't help it.
我要吃肉  孩子要吃肉012---I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
你知道和别人交往012---You know how when you're dating someone...
绝对不能欺骗她们  除非遇见特惹火的012---..and you don't want to cheat on them unless it's with someone really hot?
那当然  明白  这就对了012---Yeah, totally. All right, okay.
吃肉也一样012---Well, this is the same kind of deal.
如果你想犯错误012---If you're gonna do something wrong...
就要错得漂亮012---...do it right.
感觉好多了吗012---Feel better?
对  但要付出多大代价012---Yeah, but at what cost?
六个月   一天三顿肉012---Six more months, three meals a day?
我会吃掉几百万头牛012---I'm gonna eat like, you know, millions of cows.
要是我帮你扯平  肉方面012---Hey, what if I said I could even things out for you, meat-wise?
什么  我很会吃肉  对吧012---What? Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?
要是在孩子出生前012---Yeah. But suppose, until the baby's born...
我戒吃肉012---...I laid off it.
就不会多死动物   你是相当于在吃我的那份012---No extra animals would die. You'd just be eating my animals.
你居然愿意为我这么做012---Joey, I can't believe you'd do that for me.
当然愿意   我也可以吃素012---Absolutely. I could be a vegetarian.
啤酒里没有肉  对吧012---There's no meat in beer, right?
不要开胃菜  马上买单012---Okay, we can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers...
还赶得上预定时间012---...and ask for our check right away.
现在不能走  瑞秋要表演012---We can't go now. Looks like Rachel is going to put on a skit.
我的天哪  你疯了吗012---Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind?
不  不  我终于想通了012---No, no, no. I am finally thinking clearly.
我的幸运裙没发挥作用012---My lucky dress wasn't working out too well for me.
但这宝贝大学四年里  从没失手过012---But for four years, this baby never missed.
瑞秋  等等  我不能让你…012---Rachel, wait, I can't let...
其实  我也想看看会发生什么012---Actually, I kind of want to see what happens.
嗨  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
好棒的行头012---Nice, uh, costume.
是啊012---Oh, yeah.
我想给艾蜜莉  来个超级美式的告别表演012---Well, I wanted to give Emily a big American goodbye cheer.
太棒了012---So okay. Whoo!
预备  起012---Ready. Okay.

拼起来是什么012---What do you get?
哦  艾蜜莉012---Oh! Emily.
哇  艾蜜莉012---Whoo! Emily.
我这拉拉队长怎么样012---Okay. That's me as a cheerleader. Ta-da!
你没事吧  有颗牙齿松了012---You all right? I just loosened a tooth.
小意思  我有牙医012---It's no big deal. I have a dentist, you know?
我敷点冰块  失陪012---I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
我做得怎么样  怎么样  我认为你成功了012---What do I do now? What do I do now? I think you're done.
该脱胸罩了012---Okay, time to take off the bra.
刚才表演很精彩012---Uh, that was really great.
但我真得走了012---But I got to take off, actually.
脱胸罩012---Take the bra off.
好吧  过来  我陪你去拿外套012---All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
好的012---Okay.
瑞秋是我的女朋友012---Rachel's my girlfriend.
今晚真的很开心的012---So this was really fun.
是啊  很开心012---Oh, yeah, it was real fun.
你知道  这胸罩012---You know, this bra...
真的很不舒服012---...is really bothering me.
这里曾经是我的睡房012---You know, this used to be my bedroom.
嗯012---Yeah.
有很多回忆  很多很多回忆012---A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.
要是墙壁能说话  你知道  它们会说什么吗012---If these walls could talk, you know what they'd say?
"想回忆往事吗"012---"Want to hear some memories?"
你需要帮忙吗012---Need a...? Need a little hand there?
不  不用  没问题  我应付的了012---Oh, no, no, no. No, I got this all under control.
可你看起来不像能应付的了012---You really don't seem like you do.
算了啦   真是012---God. Forget it! Oh, this is...
事情本来不该这样的012---This is not how this was supposed to happen.
那应该怎样啊012---What was supposed to happen?
我说的时候你能不看我吗012---Can you not look at me when I say this?
我以为只要能把你找来012---I thought that if I could get you here...
就可以勾引你012---...I could seduce you.
我上班不穿西装012---Uh, I don't wear suits to work...
却从你那买了六套012---...and I bought six of them from you.
抱歉啊   我以为你有需要012---Well, I'm sorry. I thought you needed them.
我意思是  我不停地来找你  是因为我想见你012---My point is, I kept coming back because I wanted to see you.
为什么  因为我喜欢你012---Why? Because I like you.
你喜欢我012---You like me?
是啊012---Yeah.
你漂亮  聪明又成熟012---I mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.
这些印象不都是来自今晚012---A lot of this isn't, you know, based on tonight.
但是你喜欢我012---But you like me?
天啊  这段日子以来  我们竟然互相喜欢012---Oh, my God. I can't believe this. All this time, I liked you and you liked me.
啊012---Oh!
但是  不要说 "但是"012---But... No don't say "but."
"但是" 都没好事  停在 "我们互相喜欢"就好012---"But" is never good. Let's leave it at "I like you and you like me."
好012---Okay, uh...
然而  那是好听的 "但是"012---However... No, that's a fancy "but."
我刚结束我的婚姻012---My marriage, like, just ended.
我还没心情跟别人交往012---And I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
但是…012---But...
对不起  我需要点时间012---I'm sorry. I just need a little time.
好啊012---Okay.
你在这里  我刚才在找你012---Oh, there you are. I was looking for you before.
约书亚走了  你和艾蜜莉也可以走了012---Joshua's gone, so you and Emily are free to go.
无所谓012---It's okay.
她还在里面享受这场假派对呢012---She's still in there enjoying her fake party.
现在我要做什么也来不及了012---And, uh, it's too late to do any of the stuff I had planned, so...
罗斯012---Ross.
抱歉  我毁了你美好的夜晚012---I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
是啊012---Ahem. Yeah.
如果这让你好受点  我出了个大丑012---Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool of myself.
你有没有高兴点012---Helps a little.
有地方让悲惨的衰仔坐一坐吗012---Is there a room on that step for a pathetic loser?
过来  坐吧012---Yeah, have a seat.
对不起012---I'm so sorry.
没关系012---It's okay.
反正只是一段两星期的恋情012---I mean, it was just a two-week thing anyway.
我只是不想以这样的方式结束  你知道012---I just didn't want it to end this way, you know.
也许你不想结束呢012---Or maybe you didn't want it to end?
什么意思012---What do you mean?
看起来你很喜欢她012---You seem to really like her.
没错  真的是012---Yeah, I really do.
但我能做什么呢012---Yeah, but what am I gonna do?
我们说好了只在一起两个星期012---We both agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.
你知道  双方没有责任012---You know? No commitment.
罗斯012---Ross?
那个女孩整晚都跟你的朋友聊天012---That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends...
吵着要听你的事012---...asking to hear stories about you...
还拿摩妮卡的相册来看012---...looking through Monica's photo albums.
