买大堆酒  很好  很好012---Get a lot of liquor. Great. Great.
至于邀请名单有你  我  钱德012---Okay, now, uh, in terms of the invite list, obviously I got you, me and Chandler.
我也会请阿甘  因为我们讨论得很大声012---And I'm invite Gunther because, well, we've been talking pretty loud.
我会去的012---I'll be there.
听好  派对是为你办的012---Oh, listen. I know it's your party...
但我想限制博物馆怪脚的人数012---...but I'd really like to limit the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.

只找搞恐龙的就行012---Just the dinosaur dudes.
好  还得买半打汽水酒012---Okay, we'll need a six-pack of Zima.
嗨  伙计们  你们在干嘛012---Hey, guys, what are you doing?
跟我的伴郎筹划我的单身派对啊012---Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
祝你们办得比上次好012---Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
这不难  因为这次不会在012---I don't think it's gonna be that difficult, considering this one won't take place...
必胜客的地下室举办了012---...in the basement of a Pizza Hut. Heh.
我是罗斯  我是罗斯012---Oh, I'm Ross, I'm Ross.

待会见012---Okay, see you later. Yeah.
好好办不能疯的派对吧012---Ha, ha. Have fun planning your mellow party.
会有脱衣舞娘012---There's gonna be strippers there.
他没说不要脱衣舞娘啊012---He didn't say anything about no strippers.
他刚刚才说不要的  我当作没听到012---He just said, "No strippers." Oh. I chose not to hear that.
你看我买了什么   买了什么012---Look what I got, look what I got, look what I got.
居然有这种童装012---Can you believe they made these for little people?
给乡下小孩穿的012---Aw. Little Village People.
好  你看这件  我最喜欢这件012---Aw, okay. Look at this one. This is my favorite.
太可爱了012---Oh, that is so sweet.
菲比一定会很喜欢打扮他们012---Phoebe's gonna love dressing them in these.
但到时候  替他们打扮的不是她012---Huh. Except, uh, Phoebe's not gonna be the one who gets to dress them.
因为她不能把宝宝留着012---I guess she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
天哪  这真是最今人沮丧的送礼会012---Oh, my God, we are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
等等  除非我们送她产后可以用的礼物012---Wait a minute. Unless we give her all gifts that she can use...
像普通咖徘  龙舌兰酒012---...after she's done being pregnant. Like, um, regular coffee. Tequila.
还有她一直想要的皮裤012---Oh, and somebody can get her those leather pants she's always wanted.
她一定会很高兴012---Oh, she's gonna love that.
这是什么玩意儿012---What the hell is this?
送我两个月后才能用的礼物012---What, did you actually thought it'd make me feel better?
我的心情会好吗012---To give me something I can't even use for another two months?
真是烂透了012---This sucks! Oh!
好了  下个礼物呢012---All right, what's my next present?
我们都没带012---I don't have anything.
对了  那个脱衣舞娘012---Hey, listen, man, about the stripper...

嘿012---Hey...
跳脱衣舞的012---Stripper.
舞娘把戒指偷走了012---The stripper stole the ring!
钱德  起床  舞娘把戒指偷走了012---Chandler, get up, get up! The stripper stole the ring!
什么  戒指被偷了012---What? The ring is gone!
别闹  给我一分钟先让我清醒一下012---Oh. Okay, just, like, give me a minute to wake up for this.
你把戒指弄丢了  你是最烂的伴郎012---You lost the ring. You're the worst best man ever.
一点都不好笑  怎么办012---Dude, this isn't funny. What am I gonna do?
昨晚我去睡觉  一切正常012---I go to sleep last night, everything's cool.
等我醒来  舞娘不见了  戒指也不见了012---I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone, and the ring is gone!
你跟她上床了  废话012---You slept with the stripper? Of course!
你们两个012---Hi, guys.
嗨  菲比012---Hi, Phoebe.
我想说声抱歉  我昨天在送礼会上012---Ahem. I wanted to apologize if I, you know, seemed a tad edgy yesterday...
似乎凶了点012---...at my shower.
没事  都是荷尔蒙在作怪012---You know, it's just the hormones. You know?
别这样  我们  对啊  荷尔蒙嘛012---No, we... Hormones. Yeah. Hormones.
谢谢你们  你们真有心012---Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. It was just... It was so sweet.
真有心012---Oh, okay. So sweet.
你似乎好多了012---Yeah. Wow, you seem to be doing much better.
太好了  你现在怎样  很好012---That's great. How are things going? Good.
可是  最近的注意力都在我自己身上012---No, but... Okay, it feels like everything's been about me lately.
你们怎么呢012---So, what's happening with you?
我们正在说  我不去参加罗斯的婚礼012---Oh. Well, actually, we were just talking about me not going to Ross' wedding.
曾经有那段过往012---Oh. It just might be too hard...
我可能很难面对现实012---...given the history and all that.
这让我想起当年流落街头时012---Wow, this reminds me of the time when I was, um, living on the street.
有人说我陪他上床就请我吃饭012---And this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
这两件事哪里像啊012---Well, how is this like that?
我想想  的确不像012---Well, let's see. It's not really like that.
因为那样才算是问题012---Because, you see, that was an actual problem.
你这只是高中女生无病呻吟012---And, uh, yours is just, like, a bunch of high-school crap...
没人在乎的012---...that nobody really gives... Yeah.
抱歉  我只是012---Well, I'm sorry. I just thought...
泪眼攻势来了012---All right, here come the waterworks.
我已经完全没辙了012---Oh. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
我打给中介站  他们不管012---I called the company that sent her, and they don't care.
我打119又被对方吼骂012---And I called 911 and they yelled at me.
都这样了  还不能算紧急事件吗012---If this isn't an emergency, then what is?
嘿  两位  嘿012---Hey, guys. Hey.
谢谢你  昨晚派对办得很棒012---I just wanted to thank you for last night. What a great party.
博物馆那伙人玩得很爽012---And the guys from work had a blast.
其中有一个没参加过单身派对012---You know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
另一个没参加过任何派对  所以012---Yeah, and another one had never been to a party before, so...
那个  结婚戒指012---So, uh, hey, that wedding ring, huh?
可真漂亮  漂亮吧012---Man, that is nice. Yeah. Yeah, right?
我也想给自己买一只012---Yeah, I was thinking I might pick one of those babies up for myself.
去哪里能买得到啊012---Where might one get one of those?
那只戒指  我奶奶刚来到这个国家时012---That ring, when my grandmother first came to this country...
全身上下只有那只戒指  和一小包衣服012---...that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
所以那只戒指可以说是独一无二012---So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.
显然  它是我家的传家宝012---Oh, absolutely. It's been in my family for generations.
每个新娘戴上它  都能预示着幸福到老012---And every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
所以简直算是一只魔戒012---So you might say it's a magic ring.
被脱衣舞娘偷了012---Yeah, the stripper stole it.
我的戒指  我的结婚戒指012---My ring? My wedding ring?
脱衣舞娘偷了我的结婚戒指012---The stripper stole my wedding ring?
怎么  怎么会这样012---How? How could this happen?
原因就在于你说了 "乔伊  你来当我的伴郎吧"012---Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey, Joey, why don't you be my best man."
好  我来报警012---All right, all right. Fine. I'm gonna call the cops.
我搞砸了  你也用不着报警抓我啊012---Dude, I screwed up. You don't have to turn me in.
不是抓你  是抓那个舞娘  我试过了012---Not on you, on the stripper. Oh, yeah, well, I already did that.
他们说等侦破完所有谋杀案再说012---They said they're gonna look into it right after they solve all the murders...
那好  就找舞娘中介站012---Okay, we'll call the company that sent her.
我也试过了012---I did that too.
他们不肯透露她的真名或电话012---They wouldn't give me her name or number.
他们说我再打去  就要报警012---They said if I bother them again, they'd call the police.
我说  "你去报警啊  就说我掉了一只戒指"012---I said, "You talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring."
乔伊  你说说  一点办法也没有了012---So, what, Joey? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do?
怎么会这样  罗斯  我真的很抱歉012---How could this happen? Look, Ross, I am so, so sorry.
这样  我们何不再叫她一次012---Well, what if we just, uh, called her...
用假名召她  然后去我的办公室012---...used a fake name and had her come to my office?
好像不赖  但我们只能找戒指012---Oh, that sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!
菲比  你的茶012---Here's your tea, Phoebe.
感觉真好012---Mm. It's so good.
谢谢  真好心012---Oh, thanks. That's sweet.
那就好  你喜欢就好012---Good. So glad you like it.
怎么了012---Oh. What?
什么  茶是她泡的012---What? She made the tea.
不是  我刚才阵痛了012---No, I think I just had a contraction.
什么  天哪012---You what? My God.
几分钟前就有一次012---Yeah, I thought I felt one a couple minutes ago.
这次绝对错不了  你不能在这里生012---And now I know that definitely was one. Well, you can't have the baby here!
男生搬走之后我还没消毒012---I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!
没事  别怕012---It's okay. We're gonna be okay.
你懂什么  我来烧水  撕床单012---You know what? It's okay. I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets.
别紧张  可能是假性阵痛012---Ow, it's all right. It's probably false labor.
他们说  接近预产期会这样  赶快012---They said that, that can happen near the end. So just...
去拿书来  瑞秋  拿书来012---Somebody get the book. Rachel, get the book.
书  好  好012---The book. Okay. Okay. Here.
《圣经》啊   我哪懂啊012---The Bible? I don't know!
好  很好  就这样012---All right. Okay, okay. This is great.
钱德  你站到桌子后面012---Uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
但愿她一进来不会认得你   因为012---And when she comes in, hopefully she won't recognize you because...
她怎么会不认得你012---Well, why would she?
然后  你对罗斯和我打暗号012---Uh, okay. And then you buzz Ross and I.
你是冈萨勒斯先生  我是王先生012---You be Mr. Gonzales, and I'll be Mr. Wong.
民族大熔炉012---Diverse.
有人叫警卫吗012---Anybody call for security?
你们冷静012---You be cool.
好  哪位是阿甘中央咖啡厅012---Okay. Which one of you guys is Gunther Central Perk?
嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joey.
我的戒指呢  我过世的奶奶的结婚戒指呢  在哪里012---Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring! Where is it?
你还真冷静012---Way to be cool, man.
他在说什么012---What's he talking about? Oh!
床头柜的丝绒盒里有只戒指012---There was a ring in a box on my nightstand.
你一走  它就不见了012---After you left, it was gone.
等等  你们认为我偷了戒指012---Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
对012---Yeah.
一定是你偷的  少废话  从实招来012---We know you took it! So just save yourself the time and confess.
你们谁啊  少年侦探团吗012---Okay, Who are you, the Hardy Boys?
我根本没必要偷什么白痴戒指012---I don't need to steal some stupid ring.
我一星期能赚一千六012---I make $1,600 a week doing what I do.
你们有人赚那么多吗012---Any of you guys make that?
嫁给我012---Marry me.
我不懂  戒指整晚都在我房里  如果她没拿012---I don't get it. It was in my room all night. If she didn't take it...
我没拿  你没拿  那是谁拿的012---...and I didn't take it and you didn't take it. Then who did?
安静  我们在想事情012---Shh. We're trying to think.
你怎么会知道是假痛012---I still don't get how you know when it's false labor.
你有看到宝宝吗012---Well, do you see any babies?
你感觉如何  还好吧  大概012---How do you feel? Okay, I guess. I mean...
我不知道012---I don't know.
大概是我知道快要结束了012---I guess I know it's going to be over soon so...
那不是很好吗012---But isn't that a good thing?
你说你受够了  我知道012---I mean, you said you were sick of this. I know.
只是一般怀孕完之后012---It's just usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing...
就是该当妈妈了012---...then you get to do the mom thing.
我却穿着皮裤  喝龙舌兰酒012---I'm gonna be, you know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
有些妈妈也会那样012---Some moms do that.
那样更悲惨012---Yeah, that's even sadder.
我知道这么做的后果012---Look, I know what I got myself into, you know?
但他们现在在我肚子里  我好像012---It's just that now that they're in me, it's like...
