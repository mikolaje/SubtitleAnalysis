噢  保...持冷静012---Okay, just be calm.
让他感觉  我们只是在聊天012---For all he knows, we're just hanging out.

这不叫随意012---That's not nonchalant!
我都不知道你说的啥意思012---No idea what it means.

我简直不敢相信  你们一直...012---I don't believe this. Have you guys been--?
墙这边  只能听不许说话012---This is the listening side of the wall.
然后她告诉我012---Then she told me
她和乔伊已经分手了012---that she and Joey had broken up
某程度上是因为她喜欢我012---and part of the reason was she had feelings for me.
是吧  好012---Right. Yeah.
你知道我碰到查莉的那天012---You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out
就想跟她约会012---since the day I met her.
噢  我明白...012---Oh, I know, I know.
我知道你这些天来很难过012---That's been really hard for you.
总之  事情一件接一件012---Anyway, one thing led to another, and...
还没反应过来  我们已经在接吻了012---...before you know it, we were kissing.
你觉得乔伊会多生气012---How angry do you think Joey's gonna be?
这很难说  罗斯012---That is hard to say, Ross.
这很难说012---That is hard to say.
我要去找他了012---I gotta find him.
他一定就在这什么地方012---He's gotta be here someplace.
就是啊012---You would think.
乔伊012---Joey?
-他走了吗  -你怎么做到的012---- Is he gone?  - How are you doing this?
怎么  你们012---What? Hey!
你们怎么...  这是怎么回事012---What are you--? What is this?
你们一直在偷听吗012---Have you been listening this entire time?
对012---Yeah!

这是怎么回事  这么说吧012---What is this? Well, let's see.
我们吻了十分钟012---We kissed for 10 minutes...
然后和朋友说这件事012---...and now we're talking to our friends about it,
只有六年级学生才这样012---so I guess this is sixth grade.
不  你们想过这会使012---No, no. Have you thought about
事情变得多复杂吗012---how complicated this could get?
罗斯怎么办012---What about Ross?
可他现在跟查莉在一起012---Look, he's with Charlie now.
对  可他想在正式开始之前012---Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
先和你说一下012---before anything really happens with her.
作为朋友012---And as his friend,
你们不觉得012---I mean, don't you think
你们也应该这么做吗012---he deserves the same from you?
你太讨厌了  姓盖勒的012---You're a pain in my ass, Geller.
好吧  各位012---All right, you guys.
很感谢你们的意见012---Look, we appreciate all the advice...

我们能处理012---And I think We can handle it.
我们可以回去012---We'll go.
可你能为我们这些012---Will you do one thing for us,
在乎你的朋友做件事吗012---the people that care about you?
-当然  -去说清楚012---- Sure.  - Enunciate.
出去012---Get out!
他们说得对吗012---Are they right?

-虽然...  -我喜欢"虽然"012---- Although--  - I like "although."
我是说012---I mean, you know....

六年没约会了012---...six years.
六年012---Six years?

看起来我无法忽略罗斯012---I can't seem to get Ross out of my head.
好吧  让我来帮你012---Well, maybe I can help.
你的唇真软  再来一次012---Your lips are so soft. Do that again.

回纽约以后  我跟他说012---When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
谢谢  真的  我跟感激012---Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
-你好  迈克家  -我是迈克012---- Hi, Mike's place.  - Hey, it's Mike.
-真快  -不是  她还没来012---- That was fast.  - Oh, no, she's not here yet.
我想我应该离开012---You know, I'm just gonna take off
然后在电话上跟她说分手就好012---and break up with her over the phone.
你不能这样012---You can't do that. Oh, come on,
这样太怂了  迈克012---Mike, strap on a pair.
怎么不直接告诉她我们又复合了012---Why don't you tell her that we got back together.
女人欣赏诚实012---You know, women appreciate honesty.
偶尔也喜欢012---We also appreciate gentle spanking
被轻柔地打屁股012---once in a while, just FYl.
还有一件事012---One more thing.
在我的咖啡台上有张宝宝的照片012---There might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
她叫宝宝012---Her name's Precious?
她是纯种的吗012---Is she a pure breed,
还是你在动物收容所捡来的012---or did you pick her up at the pound?
总之  我只想提醒你一下012---Any way, I just want to give you a heads up.
好  如果她不高兴了012---Okay. And if she gets upset.
记得挠挠她的肚子012---...just scratch her tummy
逗她高兴012---and give her a liver snap.
嗨  我是宝宝  你是谁012---Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?
-我是菲比  -菲比012---- I'm Phoebe.  - Phoebe?
迈克的前女友菲比012---Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
他的一生挚爱  那个菲比012---The love of his life? That Phoebe?
我真想让同事们快点看看这个012---Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these!
明天晚上你才回去工作  是吗012---You go back to work tomorrow night?
对012---Yeah.
那么如果你想让他们看012---So if you want people to see them...
也就是说你破晓前不会把他们解下啦012---...you're not having them taken out, say, at the break of dawn?
如果我解下来了012---Well, if I had them taken out,
我就不能这么做了012---then I wouldn't be able to do this.
你很喜欢  对吧012---You like that, right?
你唱什么呢012---What are you singing?
《十全十美》里的波利乐舞曲012---It's "Bolero" from 10.
那是《现代启示录》里的《狂热的瓦格纳》012---It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from Apocalypse Now.
是这样  梳辫子是012---Here's the thing. The cornrows were
用来解决你头发的卷曲问题的012---a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.
现在到家了012---Now that we're home,
没有那样的困扰了012---you don't have that problem.
所以如果你考虑一下...012---If you think about it...
我讨厌他们012---I hate them.
什么  你说过你喜欢的012---What? You said you liked them.
我说过吗  我们回想一下012---Did l? Let's refresh.
我想我的原话是012---I believe what I said was
"我可以看见你的头皮"012---that I could see your scalp.
好吧  虽然你不喜欢012---Well, fine. So you don't like them.
可其他人都喜欢012---Everybody else does.
再一次  让我们回到那次旅游012---Again, let's journey back.
我记得瑞秋说的是012---As I recall, Rachel said
她以前从没注意过你的头骨的形状012---she had never noticed the shape of your skull before.
还有乔伊...012---And Joey?
乔伊当时看不出你有什么不一样012---Well, Joey didn't realize there was anything different.
我不管  我喜欢这样012---You know what? I don't care.
喜欢它  而且我要留着它012---I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it.
你嫉妒是012---You're just jealous
因为你的头发不能这么做012---because your hair can't do this.
-敲在你的牙上了  -还有眼睛012---- Get yourself in the tooth? - And the eye.
她来了  艾玛012---Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
天呐  我想死你了012---Oh, my God, I missed you.
艾玛  我真是太想你了012---Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.
你和外婆过得开心吗  呃012---Did you have a good time with Grandma Green? Huh?
她喋喋不休的时候012---Did she give you a bottle of antidepressants again
给你抗抑郁药了吗012---to use as a rattle?
只有一次  罗斯012---That was one time, Ross,
而且只有5毫克012---and they were only, like, five milligrams.
艾玛  爸爸有礼物带给你  知道吗012---Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for you, okay?
我想让你在这儿等一会儿012---I want you to wait right here.
在这  宝贝儿012---Come here, sweetie.
罗斯  我有点儿事012---Ross, actually, there's something that
要跟你说012---I really need to talk to you about.
好的  说吧012---Okay, shoot.
-好吧  好的  事情是这样的  -哦不012---- Okay. All right, here's the deal.  - Oh, no!
怎么了012---What is it?
大瓶的洗发液破了012---Oh, major shampoo explosion!
听着罗斯  这很难开口012---Look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
还沾得到处都是012---Oh, it's all over everything!
为什么  为什么偏偏是我012---Why? Why me?
因为你拿了300瓶洗发液012---Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?
对不起  对不起  你刚才说什么012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?
好吧...  是关于我和...012---Well, yeah. Look, it's about me and--
噢  不要  又一瓶012---Oh, not another one!
天呐  是摩丝012---Oh, my--Oh, and this is moisturizer!
这个更难清理012---It's even harder to clean!
为什么012---Why?
为什么坏事总是落到好人的头上012---Why do bad things happen to good people?
好吧  很显然我来得不是时候012---Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
你觉得呢012---You think?
好的  再见012---Okay. Bye.
好了  迈克已经回来了012---All right, so Mike's on his way over.
你以为你们在这儿见012---You thought you were meeting here,
他却以为在餐馆见面012---he thought at the restaurant, so....
谁对谁错不重要012---It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
重要的是我要走了012---The point is, I'm gonna take off.
你告诉我到底发生了什么之前012---Wait. I'm not letting you leave
我不会让你走的012---until you tell me what's going on here.
我是说012---I mean...
你们和好了还是怎么的012---...are you guys getting back together or something?
好吧012---All right.
苏茜  我能叫你苏茜吗012---Susie-- Can I call you Susie?
我叫宝宝012---My name is Precious.
我可叫不出口012---I can't say that.
苏茜  跟你直说了吧012---Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.
迈克跟我确实和好了012---Mike and I are back together.
并且不幸的是012---And unfortunately...
这样就要终结你们的关系012---...that effectively ends your relationship with him.
并且他对此感到很抱歉012---He's very sorry about that,
并祝你好运012---and wishes you the best luck in all your endeavors.
我无法相信  为什么012---I just can't believe this. Why?
这个我也不知...012---Well, I don't--
他为什么这么做012---Why would he do this?
我做错什么了012---What's wrong with me?
没有  你什么也没做错012---There's nothing wrong with you.
那我现在到底该怎么办012---What the hell am I supposed to do now?
可恶  女人  振作起来012---Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!
看在上帝的份上  保持你的尊严012---Have some pride, for the love of God!
好吧  你好象不喜欢苦涩的爱情012---Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
我真不敢相信012---I just can't believe
迈克竟然没有给我一点暗示012---that Mike didn't give me any warning.
他之前也不知道012---He didn't know.
他也不是计划来巴巴多斯012---He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados
向我求婚的012---and proposing to me.
他向你求婚了012---He proposed to you?
这真是史上最糟糕的生日了012---This is the worst birthday ever!
听着  宝宝...012---Look, Precious...
你不值得为迈克伤心012---Mike's not worth this.
你是个迷人聪明的女孩012---You're an attractive intelligent woman...
面对现实吧  迈克太不是东西了012---...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang.
他向我求婚的同时还跟你在一起012---He proposed to me while he was still seeing you.
他居然想在你生日的时候跟你分手012---He was gonna break up with you on your birthday?
我本来也不想炫耀012---I don't like to kiss and tell,
不过这个周末他对你不忠的太多了012---but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
天呐  可能你说对了012---Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right.
可能我并不需要他012---Maybe I don't need him.
我应该受到尊重012---I deserve to be treated with respect.
去你的  迈克012---Screw you, Mike.
你这个胆怯的杂种012---You're a coward and a bastard,
我希望你烂死在地狱里012---and I hope you rot in hell!
不用谢我012---You're welcome.
亲爱的  你在里面好久了012---Honey? You've been in there for a long time.
没事吧012---Is everything okay?
不012---Not really.
我有点问题012---I have a problem.
是吗  怎么了012---Really? What happened?
好吧  我唱着《女人不哭》跳舞...012---Well, I was dancing around and singing "No Woman, No Cry" ...
然后就挂住了012---...and I got stuck.
一点都动不了了012---You can't move at all?
噢  我可以动...012---Oh, I can move.
如果我解开你012---If I untangle you,
你会解开这个稻穗头012---will you please get rid of the cornrows?
好吧012---I guess so.
有些看起来有磨痕了012---Some of these look a little frayed.
对  我本来想咬开的012---Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hey. - Hi.
-怎么样  你跟罗斯说了吗  -没有  我想说012---- So? Did you tell Ross?  - Well, I tried...
但他的洗发液出事故了012---...but then he had a shampoo-related emergency.
-所以我想该轮到你去了  -不...012---- So I guess now it's your turn again.  - No...
最好是你去告诉他012---I think it's better if you tell him.
女人来说容易些012---You know, it's easier for a woman.
你知道  如果他抓狂了  你就可以012---That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go
我不是有意的012---I didn't mean it.
我太抱歉了012---I'm so sorry
对  女人是这样啊012---Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
好吧...这样怎么样  明天...012---Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How about this? Tomorrow...
明天我们一起去012---Tomorrow we'll both go
一起告诉他012---and we'll tell him together.
好吧  听起来公平些012---Okay, that sounds fair.
可这样我们又不能...012---That just means, once again, we can't--
我知道...012---I know...
不过没问题012---That's okay.
我们有自制力012---I mean, we can control ourselves.
我们不是动物啊012---We're not animals.
-当然  我们可以等  -是啊012---- No! Of course, we can wait.  - Yeah.
那么我想该说晚安了012---All right, so I guess that means good night then.
好的  晚安012---Yep. Good night.
晚...安012---Good night.
晚安012---Good night.
说真的  晚安012---Seriously, good night.
别说晚安了012---Stop saying good night.
真对不起啊...012---I'm so sorry.
看我在抽屉里找到了什么012---Look what I found in the drawer.
你还说我永远不会戴它呢012---And you said I'd never wear this.
我把你解救下来012---Now that I untangled you,
你还没报答我呢012---how about you do a little something for me?
当然  你想让我怎么报答012---Sure. What did you have in mind?
你应该知道的啊012---I think you know.
真的  但我有点不想啊012---Really? I don't-- I don't really feel like it.
我就是想要012---This is what I want to do.
好吧012---Okay.
我不知道你为什么这么喜欢它012---I just don't get why you like it so much.
她是个联调局特工012---She's a FBI agent,
伪装去选美012---posing as a beauty contestant.
好吧  罗斯012---Okay, Ross.
我知道你不想进来看到这个012---I realize that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but...
听我解释好吗012---Let me explain, okay?
我们什么都没做012---We weren't doing anything!
瑞秋  他看到了012---Rach, he just saw us.
但你所看到的012---But what you saw,
就是全部了012---that is the extent of it, okay?
仅仅一个吻而已012---One kiss.
不  你说谎我们在巴巴多斯就吻过了012---No, come on. That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
哥们儿  闭嘴012---Dude, chill!
好吧  我们在巴巴多斯也吻过012---Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...
可我们没想那样012---...but we didn't plan it. Ok?
发生这件事的唯一原因012---The only reason that that happened...
是我看见你吻查莉了012---...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.
对  是你开始的  我真的该闭嘴012---Yeah, you started it!  I have got to chill.
好吧  我们或许应该012---Look, we probably should
在事情发生之前跟你说012---have talked to you about this before it ever happened.
可是...012---But....
我们也感到非常抱歉  罗斯012---Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.
是  可它确实发生了012---Yeah. But it did happen.
所以...012---So...
罗斯012---Ross?
罗斯012---Ross?
干脆把门关了算了012---Can we just close the door?
《老友记》  第十季  第2集 罗斯不难过012---Friends S10E02 The One Where Ross Is Fine

可如果我没进来的话  你们会不会...012---But if I hadn't walked in here, would you...?
也许...不  不会012---Probably--No. No.
罗斯  我们本来没想012---Ross, this is not how we wanted you
让你以这种方式发现012---to find out about this.
你有权利抓狂012---You have every right to go nuts.
我不会抓狂的012---I'm not going nuts.
你看我抓狂了012---Do you see me going nuts?
不  可你知道我的意思012---No, but you know what I mean.
如果你们俩开心...012---If you two are happy...
那我也会为你们开心012---...then I'm happy for you.
我没事012---I'm fine.
-真的  -当然012---- Really? - Absolutely.

完全没事012---Totally fine.
我不知道为什么012---I don't know why it's coming out
我的声音又大又尖012---all loud and squeaky...
不过说真的  我没事012---...because, really, I'm fine.
我不是说看见你们接吻012---I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
一点也不吃惊012---to see you guys kissing.
我是说  开始我有点...012---I mean, at first I was like:
不过现在  给我时间消化了012---But now that I've had time to absorb it...
喜欢了012---Loving this.
-罗斯  -都解决了012---- Ross. - It's all working out.
我和查莉  还有你们俩012---Me and Charlie. And you two.
知道我们应该干什么吗012---You know what we should do?
冷静下来012---Calm ourselves?
不012---No.
我们应该一起吃顿饭012---We should all have dinner.
对  我们明天晚上就吃  我来掌勺012---Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!
你不觉得那样太怪了吗012---Look, don't you think that would be a little weird?
怪  为什么  哪儿怪了012---Weird? What? What's weird?
如果有人不喜欢墨西哥菜才是怪事012---The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food...
因为我会做法加它（一种墨西哥食物）012---...because I'm making fajitas!
我非常喜欢法加它012---I do like fajitas.
天呐  领养怎么这么多事儿啊012---God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming.

莱丝莉在往他身上扔百吉饼012---That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

对  我也很珍惜这点时间012---Yeah, I really cherish these moments...
因为没多久012---...because before you know it,
他们就会醒过来012---they're gonna be awake again.
他们可能比较难控制012---Well, they may be a handful...
-可他们真得很可爱  -是啊012---- ...but they're so cute.  - Yeah.
天呐  我最后一次照看他们的时候012---Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
他们最好玩了012---they did the funniest thing.
我已经4年没睡觉了012---I haven't slept in four years.
这么久了012---That's a long time.
你不知道这有多难  菲比012---You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe.
他们太多了012---There's just so many of them.
两个我还能行012---You know, two I could handle.

有时候我甚至想...012---Sometimes, I think that--
不...  我不能说012---Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
太可怕了  不012---It's too horrible. No.
什么012---What?
不...  我不能012---No, no, I can't.
天呐  弗兰克012---Oh, my God, Frank.
你想撇下他们不管012---Are you thinking of leaving?
我生那三个孩子012---Because I didn't have those triplets
不是用来让你遗弃的012---so you could run out on them.
不  我永远不会那么做  不012---Oh, no, I would never do that. No. I just...
我只是想012---...was thinking that, you know,
也许你可以带走一个012---maybe you could take one.
什么012---What?
你不能把它们分开012---You can't separate them,
这太可怕了  哪一个012---that's terrible! Which one?

这些大概就是...012---It's pretty much...

我想我刚经历了一次小高潮012---I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
我知道过程是让人沮丧的012---I know the process is frustrating,
不过是值得的012---but it's so worth it.
领养欧文012---Adopting Owen was the best thing

你想让我先洗手  是不是012---You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
这个这么漂亮  而且是白的012---It's just so pretty and white.
洗手间在走廊那头  左边012---Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

希望到下一罐的时候012---Well, maybe the next batch,

他一般不这么喝酒的012---You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
这没什么012---You know what, this is nothing.
我爸爸就是个疯狂的酒鬼012---My father is a raging alcoholic.
对不起012---I'm sorry,
让你们不舒服了012---have I made this evening uncomfortable?
法加它  当心  盘子很烫012---Fajitas! Be careful! Very hot plate! Very hot!
罗斯  你都没戴手套012---Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on.
明天手要疼了012---That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

我们不会是在讨论012---We can't seriously be talking about
把一个孩子给我  对吧012---me taking one of your kids, can we?
不  当然不是012---Oh, no, of course we're not.

爱丽丝不会支持的  是吗012---Alice would never go for it.Right?
我不知道  她也太累了012---I don't know. She's pretty tired too.
我想她可能会同意012---I think we could get her on board.
为了不起争执012---Well, just for argument's sake, you know,
假设说012---hypothetically...

"嗨  我是一只青蛙"012---"Hey, I'm a frog"?
一只会说话的青蛙012---A talking frog.
你不能带他走  他太有意思了012---Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
好吧  没关系  那莱丝莉呢012---Well, all right, that's fine. What about Leslie?

她是唯一一个会012---She's the only one that knows
打着嗝说出字母表来的012---how to burp the alphabet.

噢不...  你不能带走钱德012---No, no, you can't have Chandler.
不...  她是个小天才012---No, no. She's my little genius.
我对她抱有很大期望012---I got big hopes for her.
她会成为医生或者房地产经纪人012---She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.
弗兰克  已经没孩子可选了012---Wow, Frank, I think we just ran out of kids.

菲比012---Oh, wow. Phoebe,
看来我不能放弃任何一个012---I don't think I can give one of them up.

很抱歉  弗兰克012---I'm sorry, Frank,
我没想到事情会这样012---I didn't realize things were so bad.

我会推掉其它事  我会到的012---But I can move some stuff around and I'll be there.
你和爱丽丝可以整天呆在一起012---You and Alice just take the whole day together.
你为我们这么做012---You'd do that for us?
你开玩笑吗012---Are you kidding?
你以为姐姐是干什么的012---That's what sisters are for.
看看他们012---Oh, look at them.
我真爱你们012---I love you so much.
天呐  别醒过来...012---Oh, crap, don't wake up...
比尔和科琳呢012---Where are Bill and Colleen?
他们在厨房弄点吃的012---They are in the kitchen, getting something to eat.
真不敢相信他们有这么好012---Can you believe how nice they are?
我们必须马上走012---We have to leave.
为什么  你在洗手间做了什么012---Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
我还没去洗手间呢012---I didn't get to the bathroom.
在路上碰到了欧文012---I bumped into Owen on the way.
可他还不知道他是被领养的012---He didn't know he was adopted.
有一丝丝的可能...012---There's a slight chance...
我已经告诉了他012---...l may have told him.
天呐  我的手袋呢012---Oh, my God, where's my purse?
不  我们把东西放在这儿012---No, I can replace everything in there.
- 拿上活页册  走  -嗨012---- Get that binder and let's go!  - Hi.
给大家的一点小茶点012---Some little snacks for everybody.
你们不用吃酸蠕虫  那是给欧文的012---You don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
我一会儿去叫他012---I'll go get him in a second.
顺便说一句   你们该知道012---By the way, you should know,
我们还没告诉他他是领养的012---we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
可孩子们直觉很灵敏012---But kids are so intuitive.
你不认为某种程度上他已经知道了012---Don't you think, on some level, he already knows?
-我是领养的  -看  直觉012---- I'm adopted?  - See? Intuitive.
什么  你从哪儿听来的012---What? Where did you hear that?
他告诉我的012---He told me.
他还给我50块钱让我别说出来012---And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
那现在你该把钱还给我了012---Which, technically, now you should give back.
你告诉他他是领养的012---You told him he's adopted?
实在对不起012---I'm sorry.
可你们应该在那儿或者什么地方写明白012---But You should have a sign out there or something.
或者在人们进门的时候悄悄告诉他们012---Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.
"欧文不知道他是领养的012---"Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
他也认为圣诞老人是真实存在的"012---and he also thinks Santa is real."
他不存在012---He isn't?
我们必须走了  亲爱的012---We have to get out of here, baby.
诸位  我要向012---Everyone, I would like to make a toast...

O代表..012---O is for...
"噢  哇"012---"Oh, wow!"

我想如果我们吃点果馅饼会感觉好点012---I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
等等  罗斯  我...我要走了012---Wait, Ross. Ross, l--I have to take off.

我明天早上还有一节很早的课012---I have an early class in the morning.
不过今晚很美好012---But this has been lovely.
是吧  可你认为跟乔伊一起会尴尬012---Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey.
而且你从没真正喜欢过瑞秋012---And that you never really liked Rachel.
你过火了012---You are on fire!
我早上给你打电话  好吗012---I'll call you in the morning, okay?
-好吧  -好012---- Okay. - All right.
天呐  瑞秋  罗斯刚才说得简直太...012---God, Rachel, what Ross just said, that's just--
没事  女孩们从来都不喜欢我012---That's okay. Girls tend not to like me.
好吧012---Fine.
好吧  只上三人份果馅饼就好了012---Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.
嘿  还挺押韵012---Hey, that rhymes.
罗斯  我想我们也该走了012---You know what, Ross, I think we're gonna take off too.
当然  天呐  我真蠢012---Of course. God, I'm so stupid.
你们现在是一对了012---You guys are a couple now.
我是说  你们可能想单独呆着012---I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
不... 我只是说天晚了012---No, it's just getting late--
没事的  真的没事012---It's fine. It's totally fine.
我做了很多的马格丽塔  没事儿的012---I've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.

知道吗012---You know what?
我想我应该留下看他有没有事012---I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
这可能是个好主意012---That's probably a good idea.
明天早上见012---I'll see you in the morning.

乔伊012---Yeah, you know, Joey, l--
我认为他永远不会012---I don't think he's ever gonna
接受我们俩在一起012---be okay with this.

你什么都不用担心012---Listen, you don't have to worry about that...
因为什么都不会发生012---...because nothing's gonna happen.
你是什么意思012---What do you mean?
我们从一开始就说012---She and I said from the beginning...
如果你不接受的话012---...we weren't gonna do anything
我们什么都不会做的012---unless you were okay with it.
很明显...012---And clearly--
你在说什么  我很好012---What are you talking about? I'm fine.
没关系的  罗斯  我完全理解012---It's okay, Ross. You know, I totally understand.
你当然接受不了  你们是...012---Of course you're not fine. You're...
你们是罗斯和瑞秋012---You're Ross and Rachel.

有这么久了012---Has it been that long?
我也是这么听说的  是的012---That's what I hear, yeah.
这太疯狂了  我是说  6年012---This is crazy.I mean, six years...
就因为我  你们不能在一起012---...and because of me, you guys aren't gonna be together?
我能问你点事吗012---Can I ask you something?
说真的012---Really...

我非常喜欢她012---I'm crazy about her.
她也这么想吗012---And she feels the same way?
我想是的012---I think so.
好吧  那么012---Well, then...
可能现在我们都该往前看了012---...maybe it's time we all moved on.
对  不过  罗斯  你并没有完全接受012---Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it, so--
不  但是我会的012---No, but I want to be.
我会的012---I will be.

用那种脚趾隔离器的012---Like, with the toe separators?
为...为什么012---Why? Why?
我还是不能相信那是喷雾晒肤的结果012---I can't believe that's sprayed on.
我是说  这看起来不错012---I mean, it looks really good.
我也想做一次012---I wonder if I should get one.
当然  然后你应该穿上超短裙显摆下012---Sure, then you should get a miniskirt so you can really show it off.
你是涂了趾甲油还是只加了法式的趾甲片012---So do you get colors or just French tips?
-给你  他们的名片  -谢谢012---- Here. Here's their card. - Thanks.
我知道这个地方012---Hey, I know where this place is.
那儿曾经是个成人录影带...012---It used to be an X-rated video--
花店012---Florist.
-嗨  -嗨  菲比012---- Hey. - Hey, Pheebs.
你们不会相信谁搬回来了012---You won't believe who moved back to town.
我知道  阿曼达012---I know. Amanda.
她也打给我了  她最招人烦了012---She called me too. She's the worst.
谁是阿曼达012---Who's Amanda?
你搬进来之前012---She's this girl who lived in the building
她也住我们那栋楼012---before you did.
后来她搬去英国了012---Then she moved to England
还学了假惺惺的英国口音012---and picked up this fake British accent.
她在我留言机上的留言是这样的012---On the machine, this is her message:
"莫妮卡  亲爱的  我是阿曼达"012---"Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling."
你这是要模仿英国口音012---Are you trying to do a British accent?
钱德勒去美甲了012---Chandler gets pedicures.
我只想知道012---Just so I know,
我还要受多少次这种奚落012---how many more of those can I expect?
你知道阿曼达跟我012---Know what Amanda said
在电话上是怎么说的012---when she called me?
"哦  很抱歉打你的手机"012---"Oh, so sorry to catch you on your mobile."
如果...如果你不想跟我在手机上说012---If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile,
那就别打到我手机上012---don't call me on my mo-Bile.
我知道  她还老是拿她碰到的012---I know. And she always brags about
名人来吹牛012---all the famous people she's met.
噢  我知道012---Oh, I know!
"哦...我跟比利·乔尔睡觉了"012---"I slept with Billy Joel."
好吧  谁没睡过啊012---All right, who hasn't?
我们该怎么办012---What are we gonna do?
我不想见她012---I don't wanna see her.
我们隔离了她012---Let's just cut her out.
-什么  -把她从我们的生活里隔离012---- What? - Cut her out of our lives.
不理她的电话012---Just ignore her calls
躲开她直到她明白过来012---and dodge her till she gets the point.
我觉得可以试试012---Well, I guess we could try that.
不过...有点太苛刻了吧012---But it seems so harsh.
你这么做过吗012---Have you ever done that?
没  不过有人对我做过012---No. Had it done to me, though.
感觉不错012---Feels good.
盖勒先生  请走这边012---All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.
那么你想要颜色多深呢012---So how dark do you wanna be?
我们分一二三级012---We have one, two or three.
我喜欢你的颜色  你是几级012---Well, I like how you look. What are you?
我是波多黎各人012---Puerto Rican.
二级  我想要二级012---Two. I think a two.
你要面对着红灯012---You'll face the red light.
红灯亮的时候012---When the light's on,
喷淋开始012---the spraying's about to start,
所以  闭上眼睛012---so close your eyes.
喷淋停止的时候  数五下012---When the spraying stops, count to five...
轻轻拍打自己防止出现液体流下的痕迹012---...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
然后转身我们就可以喷你背后了  明白了012---then turn to get your back. Got it?
喷  数  轻拍  然后转012---Spray, count, pat and turn.
喷  数  轻拍012---Spray, count and pat.
你掌握得真快012---You catch on quick.
那当然  我是博士  所以...012---Well, I have a Ph.D., so...
一只绵羊  两只绵羊  三只绵...012---One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three--
等等...  我还没...我还没数完呢012---Wait... I'm not--I'm not finished counting!
你喷了我正面两次012---You sprayed my front twice!
你没转身吗012---You never turned?
没有  我甚至还没数到三只绵羊呢012---No! I barely got to "three Mississippi"!
绵羊  我是说数到五012---Mississippi? I said count to five.
不要绵羊012---Mississippi-less-ly?
好吧  那这有多糟糕012---Well, how bad is it?
还没多糟012---Not that bad yet.
不过随后四小时颜色会变得越来越深012---But it gets darker for the next four hours.
那么  会变得多深012---So how dark will it get?
你喷了两遍二级而且...012---You got sprayed with two twos and--
我是四级的了012---I'm a four?
对  不过你背上是零级012---Yeah, but your back's a zero.
你最好让它前后一样了012---You'll wanna even that out.
是吧012---Really?
你可能要再进去一次012---You might wanna get back in there.
好吧012---Oh, okay!
等等...012---Wait a minute,
后面墙上没有灯012---there's no light on the back wall.
我怎么知道它什么时候开始  有人吗012---How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello?
我的眼睛012---My eyes!
同样的事情发生了012---The same thing happened again!
-你又做了两次二级  -我是八级的了012---- You got two more twos? - I'm an eight!
谢谢你的晚餐012---Thanks for dinner.
我还以为是你付的钱呢012---I thought you paid.
看来我们以后再也不会去那儿了012---Guess we won't be going back there.
-那么...  -好吧012---- So... - Yeah.
我们到沙发上去012---Hey, what do you say
你说怎么样012---we move this onto the likes of the couch?
台词够烂  不过可以012---I say cheesy line, but okay.
-怎么了  -我也不知道  对不起012---- What's the matter? - I don't know. I'm sorry.
-我不知道为什么那么做  -好吧012---- I don't know why I did that. - Okay.
真对不起012---Sorry.
再一次  对不起012---I'm sorry. Again,
我不知道我怎么了012---I don't know what happened.
我一定是太紧张了012---I must be nervous.
我搞不懂  钱德勒很喜欢的012---I don't get it. Chandler loved it.
我保证...  我不会再这么做了012---I promise. I won't do it again.
真的  这次会很完美的012---I really do. This is gonna be great.
-好吧  -好吧012---- Okay. - Okay.
你喜欢这样嘛012---Was that good for you?
不  不  别接  让答录机接012---No, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
哦  对  可能又是瑞秋012---Yeah, it could be Rachel
要我们帮她看孩子012---asking if someone could babysit again.
-可能是阿曼达  -哦  对了012---- It could be Amanda. - Oh, you're right.
我只是拿瑞秋开玩笑的012---I was just kidding about Rachel.
看孩子很好玩012---Babysitting's a gas.
莫妮卡  你好  是阿曼达又打来电话012---Hello, Monica. It's Amanda calling again.
我就在附近012---I'm in the neighborhood,
想到你家来坐坐012---hoping I could pop by your flat.
你来自扬克斯012---You're from Yonkers!
你姓布弗玛提滋012---Your last name is Buffamonteezi!
看吧  如果你接到了留言012---Let's see. So should you get this directly...
给我的手机回电话012---...ring me back on my mobile.
好了  切勿屏住尔的气息012---Okay, don't hold thy breath.

对  我在找莫妮卡012---Yes. I was looking for Monica.
等等  她在这儿012---Hang on, she's right here.
有人打电话  找你的012---Someone's on the phone for you.

我做美甲了012---I get pedicures.
嗨  阿曼达012---Hi, Amanda.
实际上  现在不太合适012---Actually, now is not a good time.
明天一起吃晚饭012---Dinner tomorrow night?
好的  我和菲比都会到的012---Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.
为什么...  为什么你不拒绝012---Why? Why? Why didn't you just say no?
我已经拒绝让她来了012---Well, I said no to her coming over now.
我不能拒绝她两次012---I couldn't say no twice.
我有种不由自主地取悦别人的需要012---I got this uncontrollable need to please people.
好吧  好吧  一拷问你就坚持不住012---Fine. Fine. You would not hold up well under torture.
-你能坚持  -我坚持过012---- Oh, and you would? - I did.
-瑞秋  你确定你想吗  -当然012---- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this? - Absolutely.
只是感觉有点奇怪  是你和我012---It's just a little weird. It's you, and it's me.
-我们需要点时间来习惯  -好吧012---- It'll just take some getting used to. - Okay.
我们怎么能让这个变得容易点012---Okay, well, how can we make it easier?
好吧  让我们从上往下来012---Okay. Let's work from the top down.

对不起012---Sorry.
这真够浪漫的012---Well, this is romantic.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
这种事从来没有发生在我身上012---This has never happened to me before.
我是解胸罩的专家012---I'm an expert at taking off bras.
我一只手就能解开012---I could do it with one hand.
我闭着眼睛也行012---I could do it with my eyes closed.
有一次我只看了一眼012---Once I just looked at one...
它自己就开了012---...and it popped open.
都怪你的胸罩012---I blame your bra!
这是个标准型的胸罩搭扣012---It's a standard issue bra clasp!
那就怪你012---Then I blame you.
对012---Yeah. That's right.
是你把我的天赋都打走了012---You threw me off with all your slapping.
好吧  真的很抱歉  乔伊012---Okay, look, I'm really sorry about that, Joey.
有没有可能是某些层面上012---But do you think maybe, on some level,
你不想脱掉我的胸罩012---you don't want to take off my bra?
我这人没有其它层面012---No, I don't have another level.
等等  有点不对劲012---Hold on. There's something different.
我去了你老婆推荐的地方012---I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
你是去了太阳那012---Was that place the sun?
比你看到的要糟012---Oh, and it gets worse.
天呐  你一个人就能做012---Oh, my God, you can do a duet of
史蒂文·旺德：歌曲《黑檀木和象牙》（二重唱）012---"Ebony and Ivory" all by yourself.
你怎么能搞成这样012---How could you mess this up?
这很容易呀012---It's so easy.
你进到小隔间里012---You go in the booth,
数到五  转身012---count to five and turn around.
你是怎么数到五的012---How do you count to five?
一二三...012---One, two, three--
可恶012---Damn it!
我知道012---I know!
夏威夷热带小姐这是咋了012---What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
你和乔伊的约会怎么样012---How was your date with Joey?
嗯  还不错...012---Well, it was good,
至少在我们回家之前012---until we got back to our apartment.
后来我们瞎搞012---And then we were fooling around
他把手放在我的腿上...012---and he started to put his hand up my leg...
可我却不停的打开它012---...and I kept slapping it away.
你不喜欢012---You didn't like that?
不光是我012---Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
他也吓坏了012---He freaked out too.
他甚至解不开我的胸罩012---He couldn't even undo my bra.
真的  有一次他只看了我胸罩一眼012---Really? One time he just looked at my bra
它就自己开了012---and it popped open.
我不知道我们怎么了012---I do not know what's wrong with us.
我们以前接过吻  感觉很好啊012---We've kissed before and that's been great.
可是这次  感觉不同012---But this time it was leading somewhere...
我明白那是乔伊在抚摸我012---...and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
你们要永远做朋友了012---You guys have been friends forever.
记得你第一次吻罗斯吗012---The first time you kissed Ross,
那次多奇怪012---how weird that was.
你不停地笑012---You couldn't stop laughing.
可你也过了那个坎012---You got through that.
对  是这样...012---Okay. That's true. That's true,
我们能行012---we can do this.

霸王硬上弓就好012---We'll just power through.

没必要了  问题解决了012---No need, problem solved.
我们来硬的012---We are powering through.
钱德勒  别看了  它不会自己崩开的012---Chandler, stop. It's not going to pop open.
你怎么知道012---You don't know.
-嗨  菲比  -嗨012---- Hi, Phoebe. - Hey.

你觉得迈克和钱德勒012---What do you think of Mike and Chandler
出了车祸怎么样012---being in a car accident?

看我有多年轻012---Look how young I look!
天呐  我们有太多的事情要分享了012---Oh, gosh, we have so much to catch up on.
不过最首要的是摸摸我的腹肌012---But first things first. Touch my abs.
我一点儿都没锻炼012---I don't exercise at all.
天呐  莫妮卡  你结婚了012---Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.

我们什么时候不是朋友了012---When were we not friends?
是1992年012---Well, it was 1992.
我记得是因为那年012---And I remember, because that was the year

1992年我们是朋友啊012---We were friends in 1992.
不  我清楚地记得你当时在过滤她的电话012---No, I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls...
还尽量不见她012---...and trying to avoid seeing her.
你在隔离我012---You were going to cut me out?
呃...差不多吧012---Well, kind of.
-噢  我的天  -噢  见鬼012---- Oh, my God! - Oh, bugger.
我是不是不该说012---Should I not have said that?
我觉得自己就像个饭桶012---I feel like a perfect arse.
对  对  不过在美国你只是个蠢蛋012---Well, in America, you're just an ass.
喂012---Hello?
钱德勒  怎么了012---Chandler, what's wrong?

乔伊  你还好吗012---Joey? Are you okay?
大兵牺牲了012---Soldier down.
我们和菲比不再是朋友了012---We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
要是她要求  我会稍稍拒绝  不过没问题012---If she asks, I protested a little, but okay.
钱德勒  感谢上帝你还活着012---Chandler, thank God you're alive.
莫妮卡  能和你到外面谈谈吗012---Monica, can I talk to you outside?
我跟你没什么可说的012---I have nothing to say to you.

那场车祸一定很糟糕012---Oh, that accident must have been terrible.
你看着跟死人一样012---You look positively ghastly.
你看起来太治愈了012---Well, aren't you a treat.
我真不敢相信你要隔离我012---I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
为什么菲比  为什么012---Why, Phoebe? Why?
那是在我们住在一起以后012---It was right after we were living together...
你快要把我逼疯了  知道吗012---...and you were driving me crazy, okay?
你什么都要控制012---You were really controlling
强迫  还嗓门很高012---and compulsive and shrill.
我现在仍然这样012---Well, I'm still all those things!
你现在还很慷慨012---You're also so generous
善良  斗志旺盛012---and kind and scrappy.
我确实斗志旺盛012---I am scrappy.
是啊  无论我要做什么012---Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
我都不能把你从生活中剔除012---I couldn't keep you out of my life.
在我隔离的所有人中012---Of all the people I've cut out...
你是唯一一个012---...you were the only one
自己找路又爬回来的012---who ever clawed her way back in.
因为我斗志旺盛012---That's because I'm scrappy.
对  是的012---Yeah, you are,
而且我也很高兴012---and I'm so glad
你通过斗争又回来了012---that you fought your way back in...
因为我不知道没有你该怎么办012---...because I don't know what I would do without you.
我也不知道没有你该怎么办012---I don't know what I would do without you.
我想我们该回去了012---Well, I guess we should go back in.
既然你又给了我一次机会012---I mean, you gave me another chance.
我们应该也给阿曼达一个机会012---We should do the same for Amanda.
对  你说得对012---Yeah, I guess you're right.
你能相信吗012---Can you believe it?
我从来没有受过专业舞蹈训练012---I've never had any professional dance training.
现在我来给你解释是怎么工作的012---Now, let me explain how this works.
你走进隔间  然后...012---You go into the booth and--
就说到这儿吧  葛兰达  好吗012---I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay?
我看起来像是第一次吗012---Does it look like this is my first time?
我现在想要四个二级012---Now, I want four two's,
而且我想都喷到背上012---and I want them all on my back.
好吧012---Okay.
等等  这儿有两套喷嘴儿012---Wait. There's two sets of nozzles!
应该用哪一个  哪个...哪个才是012---Which one is it? Which one is it?
混蛋012---Oh, son of a bitch!
我们到底哪出问题了012---What is the matter with us?
我知道我哪出问题了012---Well, I know what's the matter with me.
不  我是说我们012---No, I mean with us, you know?
我是说  真的应该这么...012---I mean, is it supposed to be this...
难吗012---...difficult?
我不知道012---I don't know.
那个假英国腔的女人真是个婊子012---That fake British woman's a real bitch,
可她真的很能跳012---but she sure can dance.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hey. - Hi.
听着  能问你个问题吗012---Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
你和莫妮卡刚好上的时候012---When you and Monica first hooked up...
超越朋友关系  感觉奇怪吗012---...was it weird going from friends to more than that?
有点012---Kind of.
到处躲藏  跟你们玩捉迷藏...012---Sneaking around, having to hide from you guys--
不...  不是  我是说...012---No, no, no. No, I mean...
性方面...012---...sexually.
是不是你们俩某方面感觉...012---Yeah, was there a part of you that felt like it was...
这么做不对012---...really wrong?
实际上  不是  没有  感觉很好012---Actually, no. No, it felt right, you know?
感觉就像012---If felt like,
真不敢相信我们居然012---"l can't believe we haven't been doing this
早没这么做012---the whole time."
从你们的表情看012---I can tell from your expressions
我的话对于你们来说是好消息012---that's the good news you were hoping for.
好吧012---Well,
我想我要去继续传播快乐了012---I'm gonna go continue to spread the joy.
他们的反应是那样的012---Just because it happened that way for them
不见得我们也要那样012---doesn't mean it has to for us.
对...  当然012---Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
我是说  事情困难012---I mean, just because something's difficult
并不意味着你要退却012---doesn't mean that you quit.
-绝对啊  -好吧012---- Right, totally. - Yeah. And so...
那我们会不停地试啊...012---...we'll just keep trying and trying
直到我们成功012---until we do it.
对  如果不行的话  我们就会012---If not, we'll just be
成为另一对没有性爱的夫妇012---a couple that never has sex.
就这么计划了012---That's a plan.
-真没相到会有这种事情发生  -我懂012---- I did not see this coming. - I know.
那我就不明白了012---I don't know, I don't get it.
我很确定想要这么做啊012---I mean, I was so sure this is what I wanted.
我也是012---Me too.
为什么莫妮卡和钱德勒就能做到012---Well, how come Monica and Chandler could do it?
我想或许他们012---I guess they weren't
不像我们的友谊这么深吧012---as good friends as we are.
我想你肯定是对的012---I bet you're right.
那么...012---So...
好吧012---Yeah.
我爱你012---I love you.
我也爱你012---Love you too.
-好了  我要去睡觉了  -好  我也是012---- All right, I'm going to bed. - Yeah, me too.
暂时我还去不了任何地方012---Yeah. I'm not going anywhere for a while.
伙计  是钱德勒  让我进来012---Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
走开012---Go away!
我谁都不想见012---I don't wanna see anybody!
我也去了那个地方012---I know, I went to the tanning place
同样的事也发生在我身上了012---and the same thing happened to me.
让我进来012---You have to let me in.
真的012---Really?
你也数了小绵羊012---Did you count Mississippi-ly?
你没去晒012---You're not tan.
没  我只是来拍张照012---No. I just had to get a picture of this.
再见012---I'll see you later.
-嗨  大家  -嗨012---- Hey, guys. - Hey.
亲爱的  这周末我有订到012---Honey, I got us that room
那个伍德福特饭店012---at the Woodford lnn this weekend.
就是在佛蒙特的  我的暗示果然有用012---That place in Vermont? You can take a hint.
你们这周未不能外出啊012---You can't go away this weekend.
那天是艾玛生日012---It's Emma's birthday.
会有一个派对012---We're having a party.
能不能等我们回来再举办呢012---Can't you have the party when we get back?
不要啊  那就不是她真正的生日012---No. It won't be her real birthday.
如果她就一岁012---Gee, if only she were 1
也不知道生日到底是什么就好了012---and had no idea what the hell a birthday was.
这对我们很重要呢012---Come on, you guys, this is really important to us.
很抱歉  我和钱德勒真的012---Sorry, but Chandler and l could really
希望一起度个假日012---use a weekend away...
我们想沟通沟通  心理上的012---...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
我们从以前就很想做这件事012---There's this thing I really want us to do.
我在《马克西姆》杂志看到的012---I read about it in Maxim.
你们可以选择其他日子吧012---Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
我们非常希望大家都能来...012---Yeah, we want everyone to be there.
当然我也抱歉耽误你012---As much as I hate to delay your doing
对我妹妹做那些奇怪性事012---weird sex stuff to my little sister.
你们听着  这是一件大事呢012---And, I mean, you know, you guys, this is a big deal.
没有姑姑和姑父陪伴012---How can we have her first birthday party
让她怎么度过她的一岁生日012---without her aunt and her uncle?
好的  我们会留下来012---All right, we'll stay.
完事儿再开车过去012---We can just drive up after the party.
好吧  如果派对的事情012---Fine. But if we end up
害我们没做杂志上的事情012---not doing this Maxim thing because of this party--
那不是不做的理由  好不好012---Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that.
《老友记》  第十季  第4集 艾玛的生日蛋糕012---Friends S10E04 The One With The Cake
你知道吗  菲比012---You know, Pheebs,
我小的时候过生日...012---when I was little, on my birthday...
我爸会在家里012---...my daddy would hide a present
每个房间藏礼物012---in every room of the house.
然后会给我们"宝藏地图"012---And then he would draw a treasure map
叫我们自己找012---to help me find them all.
我喜欢这种家庭习俗012---I love family traditions like that.

-嗨  大家  -嗨012---- Hey, guys. - Hi.
我带了摄像机  来录艾玛的派对012---I brought the camera for Emma's video.
喔  好呢012---Oh, good!
我们想要录艾玛的派对012---We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma...
当她十八岁时  再拿给他看012---...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
酷012---Oh, cool.
-就像一个"时空胶囊"  -是啊012---- Wow, it's like a time capsule. - Yeah.
想象一下  到时她就会用一个现在还未发明的012---Oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a TV...
电视机来看这个影带012---...that hasn't even been invented yet...
跟现在和她一样还是婴儿的朋友一起看012---...with friends who, right now, are just, like, babies.
然后  他们住在一个浮起来的城市012---And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built...
为了逃避蚂蚁人012---...to escape the ant people.
希望是如此012---That's the hope.
所以  艾玛起来了吗012---So is Emma awake yet?
没有  现在午睡时间012---No, it's still naptime.
不过  马上她就醒了012---But she'll be up soon.
乔伊在哪里呢012---Where's Joey?
我说过了  现在是午睡时间012---I said, it's still naptime.
-嗨  乔伊叔叔来了  -嘿012---- Hey, there's Uncle Joey. - Hey.
说句话给十八岁生日的艾玛吧012---Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday.
-十八岁了  -乔伊  不要012---- Eighteen, huh? - Joey, no!
怎么啦  怎么啦  是要给她很辣的朋友012---What? What? It's for her hot friends.
当她们看到这个  你已经是五十二岁了012---When they see this, you'll be 52.
就是我开始想稳定下来的时候呢012---And starting to think about settling down.
乔伊  帮我把这个支起来012---Joey, will you please set this up for people
这样就可以放艾玛的礼物012---to put Emma's presents on?
非常愿意呢012---Love to. Yeah.
我们要给她礼物吗012---We were supposed to bring presents?
是啊  我写了一首歌给艾玛012---Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.
我怎么会知道呢012---Oh, yeah. How was I supposed to know?
这是一个生日派对啊012---Joey, it's a birthday party.
是啊  但她仅一岁而已012---Yeah, but for a 1-year-old.
有什么意义012---What's the point?
那天她对着杯子大笑一个多小时012---The other day she laughed for an hour at a cup.
只是一个普通杯子上面有阿母穿的像农夫的图案012---Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it, dressed as a farmer.
阿母站在牛旁边  牛说  "阿母..."012---And he's standing next to this cow, and the cow says, "El-moo."
真是好笑的杯子012---Man, that's a funny cup.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hey. - Hey.
生日的女主角呢012---Where's the birthday girl?
她还在睡觉呢012---Oh, she's still napping.
当然  她昨晚知道要办一个派对012---She was probably up all night excited about the party
肯定太兴奋了  睡不着012---she knows is happening.
我知道你们很想去佛蒙特012---I know you guys really want to get to Vermont,
对你们也是一件大事012---and this isn't a big deal to you.
但这对我们也是一件大事  好吗012---But it really is to us, okay?
艾玛不会再有第二次的一岁生日012---Emma will never have a first birthday again.
好的  你对  我们很抱歉012---You're right. We're sorry.
那把艾玛叫醒012---Let's wake up Emma
开始派对吧012---and get the fun time started!
她昨晚睡不好所以我们不能叫醒她012---She didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her.
你是不是在跟我开玩笑啊  姓格林的012---Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hi! - Hey!
很高兴你们来了012---I'm so glad you came.
真不敢相信  艾玛已经一岁了012---I can't believe Emma's already 1.
我还记得你的一岁生日012---I remember your first birthday.
罗斯很嫉妒我们把注意力都放在你身上012---Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you.
他很用力地去拉他的蛋蛋012---He pulled on his testicles so hard...
我们不得不要带他去看急诊012---...we had to take him to the emergency room.
有些关于你爸爸的事情你还不知道012---There's something you didn't know about your dad.
盖勒先生和太太012---Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
我帮你放下来吧012---Let me help you with that.
-谢谢  -太好了012---- Thank you. - Oh, man, this is great, huh?
我们三个又聚在一起012---The three of us together again.
你们怎样会更有趣吗012---You know what would be fun?
就当做这礼物是我们三个人012---If we gave this present
一起送给艾玛的012---to Emma from all of us.
你是哪一位啊012---Which one are you?
真不敢相信  艾玛还在睡012---I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
我知道  怎么办啊012---I know. What are we gonna do?
我有计划  一个好计划012---I've got a plan. I've got a plan.
我会把这个盘子012---I'm going to ram this platter
很用力的砸到你肋骨上012---really hard into your ribs.
那你会痛的哇哇大叫012---You're gonna scream out,
这样会吵醒她012---and that'll wake her up.
我不会和这种莫妮卡去佛蒙特的012---I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica.
嗨  菲比  你知道吗012---Hey, Pheebs? You know what?
即然你写了歌给艾玛012---I was thinking since you wrote a song...
那我也可以用我的才能给艾玛做些事012---...maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents.
所以  你要去泡她012---So you're gonna hit on her?
不是  不是啦  我的才能是表演啊012---No, no, no. My talents as an actor.
我可以  可以...012---You know, I could, like, maybe....
给她边读本书边演出来012---I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books.
或是  你可以把一个叉子叉在苹果上012---Or you could stick a fork in an apple.
我想艾玛会喜欢的012---Hey, I think Emma might like it.
艾玛会喜欢什么012---Oh, Emma might like what?

分开的的表演呢012---Separate performances.
但都是真的012---But equally real.
听起来好好玩了012---That sounds like fun.
你知道吗  因为大家很不耐烦012---People are getting a little antsy
要等艾玛起来012---waiting for Emma to wake up from her nap.
所以  你们可以现在表演一个吗012---So would you mind performing them once now?
-当然可以  -好...好  那好吧012---- Sure, yeah! - Okay.

太好了012---Oh, great.

我每个礼拜经历这样的事情012---I do it every week
三台摄像机对着我012---with three cameras pointed at me
整个剧组在等012---and a whole crew waiting.

嘴巴爽一秒  屁股胖一生012---"A moment on the lips, forever on the hips."
在我家不需要这种屁话012---I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
乔伊  我知道她难相处012---Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...
但她来这里也不错012---...but I think it's really good that she's here.
这样她滚蛋后我们才能更欢喜012---Because we'll appreciate it more when she's gone?
不  只是  我刚来这城市的时候012---No, it's just-- Look, when I first moved to this city,
还不是一样012---I was a lot like her.
被惯坏  自我中心012---I was spoiled, self-centered.

我想帮帮艾米012---So I want to help Amy
就像你们帮我那样012---the way you guys helped me.
我知道这需要极大的耐性012---And I know it's gonna take patience,

宝贝  你总不能给我扒下来012---Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.
你知道吗012---You know what?
现在我们也许应当坐下来012---I was thinking that maybe now would be a good time...
好好谈谈你的将来012---...for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
我没空012---Oh, I can't, honey.
我要去修眉012---I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.

才不是呢012---I doubt that.
给她讲讲我们去年怎么过的周年012---Tell her about us last year.
我给钱德勒买了一只500块的表012---Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
而他  给我写了首饶舌歌012---and he wrote me a rap song.
-真的  -用的办公软件012---- Seriously? - Word.
我的比你还逊012---Mine was worse than that.
怎么啦012---Well, what happened?
球赛时012---We were at the game.
有人在大屏幕上求婚012---This guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing.
老套012---That is so tacky.
我也是那么说012---Well, that's what I said.
结果呢  原来迈克昨晚上就想用012---But it turns out Mike was planning on
这种方式向我求婚012---proposing to me the same way last night.
天  迈克要求婚012---Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?
大件事012---That's huge.
你想嫁他吗012---Do you want to marry him?
当然想啦012---Yeah, I really do. Yes.
结果我那句话把他堵回去了012---But after I dumped on the way he was gonna do it...
我想他一辈子都不会求婚了012---...l don't think he'll ever ask again.
在巴贝多斯我拒绝过他一次了  现在又一次012---I said no in Barbados, and now this?
没错  如果我是男人012---She's right. If I were a guy and....
我刚才是不是说  如果我是男人012---Did I just say, "lf I were a guy"?
别等他求婚了012---You don't need him to propose to you.
主动出击吧012---Maybe you could propose to him.
哦  不知道012---Oh, I don't know.
我又不是想嫁想疯了012---I don't know. Isn't that a little desperate?
我向钱德勒求的婚012---I proposed to Chandler.
好吧  继续讲012---All right, moving on.
我不觉得你想嫁想疯了012---I don't think it was desperate.
我觉得你很棒012---It was amazing.
谢谢012---Thank you.
你们都认为我该求婚012---Well, do you think I should propose?
那一定很棒012---I think it could be kind of great.
当然012---Absolutely.
世上再没有比求婚012---You'll love the feeling.
更美妙的感觉了012---There's nothing like it.
好  那么以何种方式呢012---Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?
就在球赛的大屏幕上啊012---How about at a game on the big screen?
那去体育用品专卖店吧012---How about at a Foot Locker?
他既然选择过大屏幕求婚012---What? What, he obviously thinks
可见他能接受这种方式012---that's a nice way to be proposed to.
而且他也不会起疑心012---Plus, he'd never suspect it.
有理012---Yeah, that does make sense.
你们会喜欢吗012---Okay, now, would you two like that?
我喜欢012---Sounds good to me.
不过男性会怎么想012---But what would a guy think?
-奶奶电话  -哇012---- Nana's on the phone. - Wow.
有趣012---That's interesting,

莫利说她生什么病012---Did Molly say what she had?
我的喉咙也不舒服012---Because my throat's been hurting.
痛经012---Menstrual cramps.
我可能不是这毛病012---I don't think that's what this is.

抱歉  亲爱的012---No, I'm sorry, sweetie.
我要上班  还要求婚012---No, I've got work, and then I'm proposing.

我可以帮忙012---Well, I could do it.

能跟你说句话吗012---Can I talk to you for a second?

好  下一胎叫"艾拉"012---Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
-下一胎  -好012---- The next one? - Okay.
我不赞成她帮我们看孩子012---I don't want her watching our baby.
我只是想改造她012---Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person.
这是个好机会012---This is a huge breakthrough for her.
她刚刚主动要求012---She just offered to do something
帮助别的人类了012---for another human being.
我不确定012---You know, I don't know.
罗斯  我是说012---Ross, I'm telling you...
她宁愿牺牲修眉的时间看孩子012---...she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this, all right?
你知道这件事012---Do you understand
对我们女人来说牺牲多重大吗012---how important that is in our world?
我不小心听到你们的谈话012---Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
因为我想听012---because I was trying to.
就让我带孩子吧012---Listen, let me do this.

我们能读读吗012---Can we read it?
能再打印一份给我们吗012---Can you print out another copy?
恐怕不行啊  朋友012---No can do, amigo.
没用电脑012---No, I didn't use the computer.
手写的  显得更亲切012---It felt more personal to handwrite it.
-还手写  -别担心012---- You handwrote it? - Yeah, and don't worry.
我根本没有装聪明012---I didn't try to sound smart at all.

我要和查莉分手012---I have to break up with Charlie?

神经012---Crazy.

噢  天啊012---Oh, my God.
什么012---What?
乔伊  这东西在这里干嘛012---Joey, what is this thing doing here?
我在莫尼卡那里拿过来的012---I got her from Monica.
她出了个很合理的价格012---She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
乔伊  我们不能留着这个012---Joey, we're not keeping this.
但它是原版的布菲作品啊...012---But it's an original Buffay.
好的  没关系  你就留着吧012---All right, fine. You can keep it.
只要你不介意她有灵魂附体012---As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
嘿  什么...012---Hey, what? What?
有这样一个传说  乔伊012---Well, legend has it, Joey,
她在你半夜睡觉的时候会活过来012---that she comes alive when you're asleep.
她爬出这画框012---She climbs out of the frame...
然后她拖着她这半个身体012---...and then drags her half-a-body
爬在地板上012---across the floor...
想办法去偷一双腿012---...just looking for legs to steal.

慢慢地...012---...she slowly reaches up...
扭开门把手012---...and turns your doorknob.
拿走这没脚的妖怪012---Get that legless witch out of here!
嘿  我把它卖给乔伊了012---Hey, I sold that to Joey.
所以我骗他这是鬼怪了012---Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.
我们都会玩这种把戏012---Two can play at this game.

我保证  下次无论合不合适012---And I promise next time to submit you,
我都会把你推荐上去的012---whether I think you're right or not.
重点不是这个啊  钱德勒012---That's not the point, Chandler.
重点是  你说了谎012---The point is that you lied.
我知道  你说的对012---I know. You're right.
我要做什么你才能原谅我012---What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
噢  天啊012---Oh, my God.
绝了012---Excellent.
现在你该说什么012---Now what do you say?
说谎是不对的012---Lying is wrong.
还有呢...  还有呢...012---And? And?
我是个漂亮美眉012---I'm a pretty little girl.
我早就知道啦012---I knew it.
你的前男友是个疯子012---Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
随便啦  你得到那笔资金了吗012---Did you get the grant?
没有  你想知道为什么吗012---No. And you wanna know why?
因为你的前男友还是爱着你012---Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
-什么  -没错012---- What? - Yeah.
他没有给我那笔补助012---He wouldn't give me the grant,
就因为我没有放弃你012---because I wouldn't give you up.
本杰不会还爱着我的012---Benji isn't in love with me.
因为当时是他抛弃我012---I mean, he broke up with me.
而且  他是个很有道德的人012---And besides, he's a very ethical man.
是吗012---Really?
在面谈中问这种问题012---Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review:
《超狗任务》中谁给狗配音012---"Who was the voice of Underdog?"
我肯定他是在开玩笑  罗斯012---I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
如果你不相信我  我们去找他对质吧012---If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him.
可以告诉你012---I'm telling you,
他没有问过我一个关于考古学的问题012---he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
真的吗012---Seriously?
哦  不是  他问了我一个012---Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:
怎么拼"boscodictiosaur"012---"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"
和刚果的巴斯克湖拼法一样012---Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco in Congo,
那是M...B...O...012---then M-B-O--
可恶012---Damn it.
盖勒博士...  查莉  你们到这来干什么012---Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are you doing here?
我要你告诉他一切012---I want you to tell her everything.
告诉他你想和我做的交易012---About the deal you tried to make with me,
那些神经病的问题012---about the crazy questions you--
沃利·考克斯  他就是《超狗任务》的配音012---Wally Cox. That's the voice of Underdog.
就如之前的调查我告诉你一样012---Like I tried to tell you in the interview...
这笔资金不是为了012---...this grant is not based on
这些无聊的知识而设的012---your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
不  不  不  别这样012---No, don't do that.
我要你看着她的眼睛012---I want you to look her in the eyes
告诉她真相012---and tell her the truth.
本杰012---Benji?
是的  的确是这样012---All right. It's true.
我之前简直是乱来012---I behaved horribly,
但这都是因为我还爱着你012---but it's only because I still love you.
只要你回到我身边012---And I would do anything
我可以做任何事012---to have you back in my life.
早干嘛去了  本杰012---Too little, too late, Benji.
我不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
我真不应该离开你012---I never should've broken up with you.
我无时无刻不在想你012---I think about you all the time.
难道你就从来没想过我吗012---Do you ever still think about me?
没有012---No.
-有  -什么012---- Yes. - What?
我不知道该说什么好了  本杰012---I don't know what to say, Benji.
这一切实在太...012---This is all so...
浪漫了012---...romantic.
或者...012---Or?
我知道  或者我做得太过火了012---I know I may be way out of bounds here...
但我们还有机会在一起吗012---...but is there any chance you would take me back?
或者可以...012---Maybe.
甜心  你们的对话012---Sweetie, this conversation is starting to
让我觉得有点不舒服了012---make me a little uncomfortable.
天啊  我很抱歉  但...012---Oh, God. I am so sorry, but--
我是说...我们之前有太多的过去了...012---I mean, there's so much history between us, you know?
我也觉得抱歉...012---I'm sorry too.
我爱你012---I love you.
我也爱你012---I love you too.
好吧就这样  我们都可以找下家了012---Okay, that's it, we are seeing other people.
格拉达斯012---Gladys?
这个星期的第三次了012---For the third time this week.
天啊  真是常玩常新啊012---Man, this does not get old.
你真可恶012---You're mean!
不要这么孩子气啦012---Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.
嗨  你俩在干什么012---Hey, you guys. Hey, what are you doing?
筹备婚礼012---Figuring out our wedding plans.
太巧了  我们也正合计这事呢012---Funny. We were doing the same thing.
疯了  场地  服装  食品012---It's really crazy. The hall, the dress, the food.
没想到结个婚这么贵012---I had no idea how expensive this was.
是很贵012---Yeah, it is really pricey.
第一次算出结婚费用  我被那个数字吓呆了012---I freaked when I heard the numbers.
结果你们怎么做的012---So, what did you two do about it?
简单012---It was simple.
我想出了一些省钱方案012---I came up with some cost-cutting solutions...
列了个清单  结果莫妮卡叫我去死012---...wrote out a list, and Monica told me to go to hell.
没钱好省的012---There's no way around it.
只能接受现实  确实会花很多钱012---Just accept that this is gonna cost a lot of money.
听说每年花在结婚上的钱高达400亿012---I heard that weddings are, like, a $40 billion-a-year industry.
这其中我贡献过半012---Yeah. And I'm responsible for just, like, half of that.
我觉得这钱应该用在更有意义的事上012---But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use.
当真012---Are you serious?
把婚礼经费012---Yeah. How would you feel
捐献给慈善事业012---if we gave all the wedding money to charity...
我们就到市政厅登个记  如何012---...and we just got married at City Hall?
这让我越发想娶你了012---I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
不得不说  你们的高姿态  很好012---I gotta say, you guys, that's an incredible gesture.
下次你结婚也这么干如何012---Maybe you do that next time you get married.
不不不  下次我要在夏威夷斜阳下结婚012---No, no, no. The next time's gonna be Hawaii at sunset.
不过下下次可以听取你的意见012---But maybe the time after that.

我们必须表现得完美012---And it has to go perfectly,

我们要匿名捐助012---And we don't want any recognition.

因为012---Because...?
好吧  如果你想知道…012---All right, if you must know, I had a traumatic...
我小时候荡秋千遇险012---...swing incident when I was little.
-真的  -我才四岁012---- Seriously? - Yes. I was 4 years old.
我荡秋千012---And I was on the swing...
突然头发缠到铁链上012---...and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain.
结果老妈剪掉我一大缕头发012---And to get me out,
才救我出来012---my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair.
结果有好几星期头发才长齐012---And it was uneven for weeks.
你竟熬了过来012---And you made it through that?
简直可以拍成电影012---I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie.
你尽管拿我取笑012---Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
反正我就是不想艾玛去012---I do not want Emma going there.
我在想能不能让克莱尔·丹妮丝扮演我012---And I was thinking Claire Danes.
你的悲剧令我同情012---Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy.
不过秋千很安全012---But the swings are perfectly safe.
而且艾玛喜欢荡秋千012---And besides, Emma loves them.
我们同去  你就知道了012---You should come, and you'll see.
秋千速度高达40英里/小时012---Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.
当你荡到最高处012---And there's that moment when you're at the top...
鬼才知道会不会返回地球012---...when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to Earth.
宇宙充满小孩子绕轨道运行012---Space is filled with orbiting children.
求你了  来嘛012---Look, please, just come on.
你若看见艾玛的小表情012---When you see the look on Emma's face,
决不会后悔012---I swear, you won't regret it.
-好吧  -太好了012---- All right. - Good.
你不会像有的妈妈那样012---You don't wanna be a mom
把自己失去理智的恐惧遗传给小孩吧012---who passes her irrational fears to her children.
"失去理智"012---"Irrational," huh?
下次你被家里的蜘蛛吓到012---I'll remember that next time
我们再谈这个话题012---you freak out about a spider in your apartment.
这两个可以相提并论吗  秋千上012---That's the same. I'm sure there are 30
有30种不同毒液012---different species of poisonous swings.
天啊  领养中心的来早了012---Oh, my God. The adoption lady is early.
好的好的  镇静镇静012---Okay. Okay. Here we go. Here we go.
站直咯012---Stand up straight.
微笑012---Big smile.
你们好  请问这是"毛骨悚然"家吗012---Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?
还以为是领养中心的来了012---We're waiting for the adoption lady.
你来得正好012---But I'm glad you're here.
今早打扫时发现的012---I was cleaning this morning
不知道你用不用得上012---and I found this.
我不知道你是不是想用  但是...012---I don't know if you wanna use it, but....
你真好012---Oh, this is so sweet of you.
但是你知道吗012---But you know what?
我并不需要这头纱012---I won't be needing a veil,
我实际上都不会穿婚纱012---I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
我告诉过你012---I told you,
裸体婚礼我不会参加的012---I am not coming to a naked wedding!
我们不会招待宴请012---No. We're not having a big reception.
我们把婚礼经费012---we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding
捐给儿童慈善事业了012---and we donate them to the children charity.
你真疯狂012---That's crazy!
抱歉  只是无法想象012---I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
一生只有一次啊012---my one wedding day like that.
我们不同012---Well, we're different.
我不在乎什么盛大婚礼012---I don't care about having a huge party.
头纱你戴是很美  但是...012---This is really nice for you, but....
你看我一戴上  简直就...012---Oh, please. I put this on and I just look like--
美极了012---Well, radiant.
管它呢012---All right, but who cares?
我不需要头纱婚纱这些玩意012---I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
对  你们是互许终身012---That's right. You're making a commitment.
不管在广场举行还是别的什么地方都是一样012---You know, that's the same whether you do it at the Plaza or....
-你选了啥地方  -市政厅012---- Where you gonna do it? - City Hall.
好地方012---Oh, that sounds nice.
我刚去过那做评审委员012---I was just there for jury duty.
他们把那打理得非常整洁漂亮呢012---They've really spruced that place up.
没关系...012---Okay. It's okay...
我已经下定决心012---I've made my decision.
但我真正想要的是一个盛大的婚礼012---What I really want is a great big wedding.
但钱已经捐啦012---But you gave all the money to charity.
可以要回来012---Well, I'll just ask for it back.
不行吧012---I don't think you can do that.
怎么不行012---Why not?
她这可是结婚012---This is her wedding day.
这可比什么愚蠢的小孩子重要多了012---That's way more important than some stupid kids.
说得好  亲爱的012---That's sweet, honey,
但这些话省下来说给领养中心的人听吧012---but save something for the adoption lady.
-好  小心点  -好012---- All right, okay. Be careful. - Okay.
小心  小心她头发012---Careful. Watch her hair. Watch her hair!
她才三根毛012---Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
我知道  我知道012---I know. I know.
但是很漂亮012---But they're just so beautiful.
糟糕  扯掉一根012---Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
我保证  她很安全012---I promise you she's safe.
你看她多喜欢玩秋千012---Watch how much she loves this.
好吧  好吧012---Okay. Okay.
你准备好了吗  亲爱的  开始喽012---Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.
小心012---Okay, careful. Okay.
她笑了012---She's smiling.
看  她真的很喜欢012---Look at that, she does like it.
看到没  我告诉过你的吧012---See, I told you.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
看看她真有不怕死的精神012---Look at her, she's a little daredevil.
让我推好不好012---Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?
哦  当然012---Oh, absolutely.
你去拿相机012---Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
在尿布包里012---It's in the diaper bag.
好012---Okay.
还怕秋千012---See? Scared of the swings.
现在觉得傻了吧012---I bet you feel pretty silly.
我们真要把钱要回来012---We're asking for the money back?
结婚要用012---It's for our wedding day.
这小子喜欢男的女的012---Now, is this guy gay or straight?
我们非得出美人计012---Because one of us has to start flirting.
你们一天来捐两次钱012---You here to make another donation the same day?
真是前所未有呢012---I don't think that's ever happened before.
同性恋  你上012---Gay. Go.
天呐  你的衬衣好帅012---Oh, my God, I love your shirt.
我们今天捐的钱012---The donation we made earlier?
我们想要回来012---Well, we want it back.
什么012---Excuse me?
那是办婚礼的钱012---Okay, that money was for a big wedding
我们本来不想大办012---we thought we didn't want.
但现在我们改变了主意012---But it turns out we do.
所以你要我们退还012---So you're asking us
你们捐给孩子们的钱012---to refund your donation to the children?
对012---Yeah.
这样感觉真不错012---This feels really good.
对不起  真的012---I'm sorry. I am.
但婚礼对我相当重要012---But this wedding's just really important to me.
不关我事012---Hey, it's none of my business.
也许这是件好事012---Besides, this is probably a good thing.
别把孩子惯坏了012---We've really been spoiling the children,
让他们吃饱穿暖干嘛012---what with all the food and warm clothing.
你这么说不公平012---That's not fair.
结婚是大事012---A person's wedding is important.
尤其对于我来说012---And especially to me.
我没参加过毕业典礼012---I didn't have a graduation party.
没有毕业舞会012---And I didn't go to prom.
在我的16岁生日的时候012---And I spent my sweet 16 being chased around a tire yard...
我被精神病人在一个废旧轮胎场地狂追012---...by an escaped mental patient
他还说012---who, in his own words, wanted to:
杀我什么的012---"Kill me, or whatever."
我应当有个隆重的婚礼012---So I deserve a real celebration.
我不会让你个流汗男012---And I'm not gonna let some sweaty little man
弄的我觉得内疚012---make me feel badly about it.
她也有可能是在说我012---She could've been talking about either one of us.
我是劳拉012---Hi, I'm Laura.
我来做领养家访012---I'm here for your adoption interview.
我是莫妮卡  这是钱德勒012---Hi, I'm Monica. And this is Chandler.
-请进  -谢谢012---- Please come in. - Thank you.
请进  喝点什么012---Would you like something to drink?
喝水可以了012---Water would be fine.
你总算来了012---We're so glad that you're here.
我们好兴奋  终于开始领养小孩的流程了012---We're excited about getting this process started.
因为我们爱小孩  爱得要死012---Because we love kids. Love them to death.
不是真的要孩子"死"012---Well, not actually to death.
只是这么形容一下012---That's just a figure of speech.
我们爱孩子  恰当合理012---We love kids the appropriate amount...
符合法律法规012---...as allowed by law.
-你们家好可爱  -谢谢012---- Your place is just lovely. - Thank you.
这栋楼的确看起来很卫生012---Yes, this building does have a wholesome,
给人家的感觉012---family feel to it.
我好像来过这里012---I feel like I've been here before.
这里还有谁家在申请领养吗012---Any other couples in the building adopting?
是不是一楼那家012---Is that that couple on the first floor?
我们应该比他们先得到孩子012---Because we should get a baby before them.
他还想卖毒品给我012---That guy tried to sell me drugs.
但其他人都好012---But other than that,
这是栋干净卫生的楼012---wholesome, wholesome building.
怎么012---What?
我想起来了为什么我对这楼有记忆了012---I realized why I remember this place.
真的  怎么回事012---Really? What is it?
哦  没什么012---Oh, it's nothing.
我和住在这栋楼里的一个男人约会012---I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building.
结果无疾而终012---It didn't end very well.
那人该不是叫乔伊·崔比安尼吧012---That wouldn't, by any chance, be Joey Tribbiani?
-就是他  -当然是他012---- Yes! - Of course it was.
良宵过后012---We had a great night.
他说他再打电话给我012---In the morning, he promised he'd call
结果再没联络012---and he didn't.
真他妈混蛋012---Rat bastard!
你们该不是他朋友012---So you're not friends with him?
当然不是  不012---Oh, God, no.
当然不是  不012---No, no, no.
当然不是012---No. Nope.
不...012---No...
不...012---No...
不...012---No...
不...012---No...
不...012---No...
抱歉提到这事012---Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.
那么你们当中有人打算待在家里吗012---So are either one of you planning on staying at home?
有人吗  名人驾到012---Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity?
怎么了012---What was that?
过道上乱跑的疯子012---That's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here.
不过他对小孩很慈祥012---He's great with kids, though.
罗斯  天啊  你还好012---Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
他妹的012---Son of a bitch!
别紧张  我又没说F打头那个字012---Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.
罗斯  看吧012---Ross, see,
早告诉你了  秋千太邪恶了012---I told you! Those swings are evil!
就这一次了012---That is it.
这辈子再也不许012---That's the last time Emma is getting on
艾玛接近它012---one of those things for her entire life.
别这样  不是秋千的错012---No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't the swing's fault.
是我错012---It was my fault.
还有那孩子的错012---And kind of that kid's fault.
他还笑呢  算你恨012---Who is still laughing. Nice.
在再有人受伤之前012---Come on. Can we just get out of here
我们走吧012---before somebody else gets hurt?
不  等等  这样吧012---No. Wait. Ok, ok. I have an idea.
你去荡秋千012---I want you to get on the swing...
你会发现没什么好担心的012---...and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
我知道你意欲何为了012---I know what this is all about.
你一贯嫉妒我满头秀发012---You've always been jealous of my hair.
这只是想你已经成年了012---I just think you're an adult, okay?
该克服那些愚蠢的恐惧了012---And you should get over your silly fears.
好  上就上012---All right, fine. I'll do it.
好012---Good.
如果你敢抓蜘蛛012---If you hold a spider.
在哪儿  在哪儿012---Where?! Where?!
我说"如果"你敢抓蜘蛛012---If you hold a spider.
我听见了012---I know.
伙计们  没事吧012---Guys, is everything okay?
是我  乔伊012---It's me, Joey.
领养012---Adoption!
到底怎么回事012---What's going on?
就是那个叫波特疯子012---Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...
在过道上跑012---...Bert, roaming the halls.
伙计们012---Guys?
接着跑吧  波特012---Keep on roaming, Bert!
今天我们不看你疯了012---We don't want any crazy today!
到底怎么了012---What's going on?
我们等会再说  波特  一切都好012---We'll talk later! Bert. Everything's fine!
听起来就是有问题012---Everything doesn't sound fine.
他独自一个在外面  不会出事吧012---Is he all right out there by himself?
没事  他有监管人012---Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
是他哥012---His older brother...
叫欧尼012---...Ernie.
波特和欧尼012---Bert and Ernie?
无巧不成书012---You can't make this stuff up.
你没说过你16岁生日时012---You never told me about that guy
被男人追杀的故事012---and your sweet 16.
真可怜012---I'm sorry about that.
结局还算好012---Oh, it ended okay.
我朋友毙了他012---One of my friends shot him.
至少你会有个体面婚礼012---At least you'll get a proper wedding.
你该得的012---You really deserve that.
是的  没错012---Yeah, I really do.
知道吗  长这么大我还没风光过012---You know, I had nothing growing up.
就像被我剥夺金钱的那些孩子一样012---Just like the kids I took the money from.
不...  看出你苗头了012---No... I see where this is going.
别又想让我退回去012---Don't make me go back there.
我不能用这钱办婚事012---Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now.
这样就有污点了012---It's tainted.
好吧  退回就是了012---Fine, we'll give the money back.
如果慈善捐助处那家伙012---If that guy at the charity
又叫咱们难看012---gives us a hard time...
我朋友的老枪好久没见过血了012---...my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.
我想说  这种环境012---I must say this seems like
培养小孩似乎很理想012---a lovely environment to raise a child in.
你尽可以在各种家具012---You are welcome to look under
下面搜查012---any of the furniture...
相信我012---...because, believe me,
绝无黄书和香烟什么的012---you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there.
在到处看看之前012---Before we look around,
让我先检查下我的表012---let me make sure
是不是都填好了012---I have everything I need up to here.
我带你去看看婴儿房012---Why don't I show you the baby's room.
你干啥012---What are you doing?
你不让我进来012---You wouldn't let me in.
我以为你们出事了012---I thought you were in trouble.
才没有012---Well, we're not.
但你叫我"波特"012---But you called me "Bert."
那是"危险"的暗号012---That's our code word for danger.
我们没约定过什么暗号012---We don't have a code word.
没有吗012---We don't?
应该约一个012---We really should.
从今往后012---From now on,
"波特"就用来作为遇到危险的暗号012---"Bert" will be our code word for danger.
参观完婴儿房012---So that was the baby's room.
下面参观哪里012---What room should we see next?
除了沙发后面都可以参观012---Any room that isn't behind this couch.
有些人不懂他的笑话012---Some people don't get him,
但我觉得他真幽默012---but I think he's really funny.
我不在乎被你粗暴对待012---I did not care for that.
你得回避012---You have to leave.
你和这个社工睡过012---You slept with our social worker
再没联络她012---and never called her back.
她还在生你的气012---She is still pissed,
不能让她见到你012---so she can't see you.
好  好012---Okay, okay.
-怎么了  -忘了拿球棒012---- What? - I forgot my bat.
天呐012---Oh, my God.
最后一次告诉你012---And for the last time,
我们不想和你做朋友012---we do not want to be friends with you!
也不想买你的球棒012---And we don't wanna buy your bat!
你来这儿干什么012---What are you doing here?
"波特"...012---Bert...
你们是朋友012---Are you friends with him?
我来解释012---I can explain.
乔伊你说012---Joey?
好吧012---All right. Okay.
你还敢回来  太有种了012---You have got some nerve coming back here.
真不敢相信你竟从来没给我打过电话012---I can't believe you never called me.
你说什么呢012---Excuse me?
你可能连我名字也忘了吧012---You probably don't even remember my name.
告诉你  我叫乔伊012---It's Joey, by the way.
不必说你的名字012---And don't bother telling me yours,
我记得  女士012---because I totally remember it, lady.
我一直等你电话012---I waited weeks for you to call me.
我给你电话号码了012---I gave you my number.
你没联系我啊012---You never called me.
还想把屎盆子往我身上扣012---Don't try to turn this around on me.
我可不是012---I am not some kind of social work...
让你可以随便做的012---...that you can just...
社会工作012---...do.
我确信给过你电话012---I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
真的吗  那你想想看012---Really? Think about it. Come on.
你这么漂亮012---You're a beautiful woman.
聪明又有趣012---Smart, funny.
你我春风一度012---We had a really good time.
如果我有你电话012---If I had your number,
怎么可能不打给你012---why wouldn't I call you?
就是不知道呀012---I don't know.
可能我搞错了012---Well, maybe I'm wrong.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
现在道歉太晚啦012---Hey, too late for apologies. Okay?
你伤了我的心012---You broke my heart.
你知道就为了忘掉你012---You know how many women
我睡了多少女人吗012---I had to sleep with to get over you?
-乔伊  留步... -不012---- Joey, wait-- - No!
我等得够久012---I waited a long time!
不可能再等了012---I can't wait anymore.
抱歉让你们笑话了012---I'm sorry that you had to see that.
太丢人了012---I'm so embarrassed.
没事012---Oh, that's really okay.
我们理解012---Yeah. We totally understand.
约会可够人受的012---Dating is hard.
你们真是好人012---Boy, you people are nice.
我得说…012---And I've got to say...
你们一定会是很棒的父母012---...l think you're going to make excellent parents.
劳拉012---Laura!
我们回来啦012---We're back.
你们是想再多要点钱012---Are you here to take more money?
你们应该找提款机012---Because I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
不不  我们把钱退给你们012---No, no, we're here to give the money back.
因为你知道012---Yeah. Because you know what?
一切都是为了孩子012---It's all about the children.
当然  我们的婚礼也很重要012---Although it's also about the wedding.
好吧  给012---All right, here.
不要  天呐012---No. Oh, God.
我好像还没有说012---If I haven't said so already,
恭喜你啊  先生012---sir, congratulations.
够了  好吗012---Enough, all right?
我要插手做决定了012---I'm stepping in and putting my foot down.
作为你的未来老公012---As your future husband,
我说了算012---I'm gonna make this decision for us.
你说咋办012---What do you think we should do?
现在不是你们说了算了012---You know what. It's not your decision anymore.
什么012---What?
我代表纽约儿童012---On behalf of the children of New York,
拒绝你们的捐款012---I reject your money.
但是我们在给你钱啊012---But we're giving you this.
现在退给你们012---And I'm giving it back to you.
拿着吧  当作礼金好了012---Come on. Consider it a contribution.
你可真够大方啊012---Well, this is very generous.
支票拿走012---Please take the check.
祝婚礼成功012---Have a great wedding
幸福甜蜜012---and a wonderful life together.
听来不错012---Sounds good to me.
我们以后存了钱012---We can save up, come back in a few years...
过两年捐更多012---...and make an even bigger donation.
当然  下次记得找布莱恩捐012---Absolutely. And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
-布莱恩是你  -不012---- Oh, is that you? - No.
喂012---Hello?
哦  嗨012---Oh, hi.
天啊  真的吗012---Oh, my God, really?
我迫不及待想告诉钱德勒了012---I can't wait to tell Chandler.
好  再见012---Okay. Goodbye.
打错电话的012---Wrong number?
是劳拉012---That was Laura.
她替我们大大美言012---She gave us a great report
我们正式上了领养排队名单012---and we're officially on the waiting list.
太好了012---That's great.
我们现在就等人012---Now we just wait for a call...
给我们打电话告诉我们012---...and someone tells us
有个小孩等我们去领养了012---there's a baby waiting for us.
喂012---Hello?
看见乔伊的球棒吗012---Have you seen Joey's bat?
好了  我捉到了蜘蛛012---Okay. I got a spider.
有两只  我挑了只大的012---There were two, I picked the bigger one.
-好的  -好的012---- Okay. - Okay.
感觉一切正常012---This feels perfectly normal.
好了  你上秋千去012---Okay, get on the swing.
好啊012---Okay.
好012---Okay.
好啊012---Okay.
看到了吗012---See?
啊  没事了  我可以玩秋千了012---All right. I can do this.
是啊  干得好012---There you go. Good for you.
知道吗  我已经习惯这小家伙了012---You know what? I'm getting used to this little guy.
我已经完全感觉不到它的存在了012---I don't even feel him in here anymore.
因为它爬到你脖子上去了012---That's because he's on your neck.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hey, guys. - Hey.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hi. - Hey.
我们有点事和你们谈谈012---We need to talk about something.
我们觉得012---Yeah. We don't feel like
今年我们不能再作东感恩节晚餐了012---we can host Thanksgiving this year.
-什么... -你是在开玩笑吧012---- What... - Are you kidding?
连带工作  还有领养孩子的压力012---Well, it's just with work and the stress of adoption...
我们只是觉得没有精力弄了012---...we don't feel like we have the energy.
而且每年都让我们受累012---Plus, we don't think it's fair
这不公平012---that every year the burden falls on us.
这口气不像你啊012---That doesn't sound like you.
这像是莫妮卡的话012---That's Monica talking.
不  不  这是我们两个人的决定012---No, no, we made this decision together.
你把她放你嘴里的话  又说了一遍012---She's putting words in your mouth.
你不应该把话放到我们口中012---Don't you put words in people's mouths.
而是把火鸡放到我们口中012---You put turkey in people's mouths.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
这可是艾玛的第一个感恩节012---This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.
才不是...012---No, it's not.
不是吗  她什么时候出生的012---It's not? When was she born?
我个人认为012---Well, personally,
你们是应该休息一下子了012---I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
谢谢  菲比012---Thank you, Pheebs.
不客气  这样倒好012---Sure. It's just as well.
我是说  去年的晚餐也没那么好012---I mean, last year wasn't very good.
她已江郎才尽  今年不会更好了012---I think she's losing her touch.
什么  你大错特错了  女士012---What? You are way off, lady.
是么  真的吗  是么012---Am l? Really? Am l?
那你就再做一次感恩节大餐012---Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner
证明我错了012---and prove me wrong.
你好好想想012---Well, think about it.
你这是在跟去年的你比拼012---You'd be trying to top what you did last year.
你是在和...自己竞争012---You'd be in competition with yourself.
大爱啊012---That's my favorite kind.
好吧  今年我们继续012---Okay, we are doing this.
别让自己这么容易被左右012---Don't let yourself get manipulated this way.
不关你的事  钱德勒012---Stay out of this, Chandler.
这是"我"和"我"之间的事情012---This is between me and me.
这件事012---We are supposed to
我们应该一起决定啊012---make these decisions together.
还记得我给你录的菲尔医生怎么说的么012---Did you not watch the Dr. Phil I taped for you?
《老友记》  第十季  第8集 感恩节晚餐大家都迟到了012---Friends S10E08 The One With The Late Thanksgiving
-嗨  -嗨  感恩节快乐012---- Hey. - Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.
火鸡殉难日快乐012---Happy Needless Turkey-Murder Day.
我从布利克012---You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
订了些巧克力派012---from that bakery on Bleeker.
你们能帮我去取回来么012---Could you pick them up for me?
你不自己作派吗012---You're not making the pies?
不  我不做巧克力派的012---I don't make chocolate pies.
我小时候012---When I was younger,
参加过一个吃派比赛012---I entered this pie-eating contest.
吃得太多了012---I ate so many
导致我一想就恶心012---that the thought of them makes me sick.
那你赢了没有012---Did you at least win the contest?
两分钟吃了12个外加1片012---Two minutes, twelve pies and a part of one tin.
好吧  我们4点见012---Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
很让人期待哦012---Can't wait.
今年的晚餐一定棒极了012---This dinner is gonna be so great.
去年的莫妮卡  我要你好看012---In your face, last-year me.
-嗨  瑞秋  -嗯012---- Hey, Rach? - Yeah.
艾玛今天的行程是什么012---What's Emma doing today?
我们看看啊012---Well, let's see,
我只知道她今天要和律师见面012---I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer...
然后呢  她要拉个大便012---...and then she has to make a very big poop.
怎么了012---Why?
我想让她参加婴儿选美012---Well, I want to enter her in a baby pageant.
哦  天呐012---Oh, my God.
这是我听说过的最让人毛骨悚然的事情了012---That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard.
在你拒绝之前  听我说012---Okay, but before you say no,
我朋友苏珊娜带她的孩子参加了012---my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.
和艾玛比起来012---And compared to Emma,
那小家伙就像只小狗012---she's a real dog.
哦  菲比  所有孩子都是美丽的012---Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
好吧012---Oh, okay.
不  菲比012---No. Phoebe,
难道我们只是为了一个奖杯012---just the idea of pitting one baby against another...
就把孩子们比来比去012---...l mean, you know,
决定谁更漂亮012---and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
还有一千块奖金012---And a thousand dollars.
对此我很感兴趣012---...is something I'm very interested in.
对了  千万别告诉罗斯012---Oh, please, do not tell Ross.
他还是相信012---He still believes that
内在的东西才重要012---what's on the inside is important.
对了艾玛得012---Okay. And Emma needs a cowgirl outfit
穿牛仔装参加比赛012---for the competition.
感恩节我上哪儿找牛仔装啊012---Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
我在想...012---Well, I was thinking--
把乔伊的椰菜娃娃的衣服扒了012---Take the clothes off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!
又有人把指挥棒给掉了012---Did someone drop the baton again?
为什么从堪萨斯那么老远来012---Why come all the way from Kansas
就为了做这个012---to do that?
老娘不是越来越老  而是越来越好012---I don't get older, I just get better.
你知道我刚想到什么012---You know what just occurred to me?
这可能是最后一次012---This could be our last Thanksgiving
只有我们两个人一起过感恩节了012---just the two of us.
我是说  我们很快就会有个孩子了012---I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.
你怎么知道012---You don't know that.
有人会选择我们的012---Somebody's gonna pick us.
可是这几周012---But we haven't heard a thing
我们都没收到领养消息012---from the adoption agency.
我告诉你  肯定会的012---I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.
明年会是012---Next year,
你我还有小海明威·宾012---it's gonna be you, me and little Hemingway Bing.
干嘛  他是我最喜欢的作家012---What? He's my favorite author.
说出他一本书的名字012---Name one of his books.
《企业》012---The Firm?
好吧  火鸡已经在烤箱里了012---Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's in the oven.
添料也准备好了012---The stuffing is ready.
你知道么012---You know,
你总是自己弄这些东西012---you always cook this meal all by yourself.
今年让我帮帮你吧012---Let me help this year.
钱德勒  这太好了012---Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.
但你不用一直按菲尔医生说的做012---But you don't have to do everything Dr. Phil tells you to do.
我是认真的  让我做点什么吧012---I'm serious, let me do something.
不是给火鸡填馅  做点不难的东西  .012---Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.
我想想...012---Okay, let's see.
啊  酸梅酱012---Oh, the cranberry sauce.
很容易做012---It's easy to make,
而且大家也不是很在意那东西012---and no one really cares about it.
还有呢012---Tell me more.
我去对门儿检查别的012---I'm gonna go check on something across the hall.
你先把这个洗干净吧012---You start by washing these.
别用洗涤剂012---Not with soap!
你肯定没吃过我沐浴液洗过的土豆012---You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes.
嘿  猜猜乔伊拿到了什么012---Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
三张今天纽约流浪者的票012---Three tickets to today's Rangers game!
兄弟  我是让他猜的012---Dude, I wanted him to guess.
哦  天哪012---Oh, my God.
是啊  而且都是好座位哦012---Yeah, they're great seats too.
猜猜什么位置012---Guess where they are.
正中间012---Center ice.
我是不是和你有什么过节012---Did I do something to you?
比赛一点开始012---The game's at 1.
怎样012---So?
晚饭四点开始  我们赶不回来的012---Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
那我们就提前退场012---So we'll leave before it's over.
我们会准时回来的012---We'll be back in time.
你现在这么说012---You said that now.
可是到时候必定要花很多时间回来的012---But it could take us a long time to get back home.
另外乔伊可能会迷路012---Plus, Joey could get lost
他们还得喊我们把他领会来012---and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
老兄  事不过三012---Dude, two times that happened!
莫妮卡为了做晚饭忙了一整天012---Look, Monica's been working hard all day.
她一开始的时候是不想做的012---She didn't want to host in the first place.
我们不该去的012---We shouldn't go.
他说得没错儿012---He's right, man.
好吧  那么四点钟见012---Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
嗯012---Okay.
准备好品尝012---And get ready to taste
我的特制酸梅酱哦012---my very special cranberries.
或者  应该叫做"钱式酸梅"012---Or should I say "Chan-berries"?
伙计  你真够搞笑的012---That's some gentle comedy, dude.
我们还是要去看比赛的  对吧012---We're still going to the game, right?
是的012---Yeah.
嘿012---Hey.
菲比  我想走了012---Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.
这地方让我坐立不安012---This place is freaking me out.
你看到那边那个人了么012---I've been watching this guy over there.
我可不认为他带来的是个孩子012---I don't think he came with a kid.
但你现在不能离开啊012---But we can't leave now.
有一个叫黑利的小孩012---There was this one baby, Haley,
是夺冠的大热门012---who was favored to win...
得了哮喘  不得不待在家里012---...she got croup, so she had to stay home.
这次比赛才大开方便之门  家长们012---This competition just blew wide-open, folks.
菲比  这太奇怪了012---Phoebe, it's just too weird.
我看见一个一岁的小孩穿连裤袜012---I just saw a 1 -year-old with pantyhose on.
我知道  我们准备的确实不够充分012---Oh, I know. We should've been more prepared.
没事儿  我觉得012---It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
咱们最有力的竞争对手是卡梅伦012---our real competition now is Cameron.
天呐  她的衣服被脱掉了012---My God, they just took her sweater off.
看他的手臂  你好  米其林先生012---Look at those arms. Hello, Michelin Man.
菲比012---Phoebe, come on.
已经都三点了012---You know what, it's already 3:00.
他们还没有评审到艾玛这一组012---They haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet.
我们该走了  回去吃饭012---We got dinner.
但是艾玛的条件都具备了012---But Emma's got what it takes.
她一定能走到最后012---She could go all the way!
菲比  冷静点012---Phoebe, you have to calm down.
好吧012---Okay.
瑞秋  三州交界地区012---Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area
最漂亮的宝贝们都在这里了012---are in this room right now.
而我听见一个评审说012---I overheard a judge say
没人比得过艾玛012---that not one of them holds a candle to Emma.
-真的么  -没错012---- Really? - Yeah.
你听见他们这么说012---You heard him say that?
对012---Yeah.
好吧  那就让我们012---All right. Okay. All right,
给其他的孩子们一点悲惨的回忆012---let's give these babies something to cry about.
太好了  开工吧012---Good. Let's get down to business.
艾玛需要化妆012---Emma needs some makeup.
什么012---What?
不化妆跟其它孩子比起来会逊色三分的012---She's gonna look washed-out next to the others.
菲比  我不会让你给我的孩子化妆的012---No, Phoebe, I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby.
为什么不012---Why not?
因为我已经给她化过了012---Because I already did.
太逊了  快下场吧  你个白痴012---You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot!
-太精彩了  -没错  耶012---- What a game. - I know. Yeah.
钱德勒错过了这场比赛真遗憾啊012---I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
我也替他觉得遗憾012---I'm sorry he's not here.
但我不得不说012---But I gotta say,
我真的很喜欢这个"玉米片"座012---I am really enjoying nacho chair.
嗯  要是你不总是把我的手打开012---Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
我也许会更喜欢些012---if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
这位置太棒了012---These seats are great.
是啊  没错012---I know, I know.
上次在这看假期冰上节目012---When I was here for "Holidays on lce" ...
座位太远了012---...l was sitting so far away,
关颖珊根本就看不到我举的条幅012---Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.
我们该走了啦012---We'd better get going.
现在不走  回去吃饭就晚了012---If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.
可比赛太精彩了012---But it's a tie game.
回去晚点应该可以吧012---So we're a little late.
女生们会在那的012---The girls will be there.
再进一个球再走啦012---Let's just stay for one more goal.
-不好吧  -再有人打一架012---- I don't know. - One more fight.
-好吧  -好吧012---- Okay. - Okay.
大家都哪里去了012---Where is everybody?
他们迟到了45分钟012---They're 45 minutes late.
我真不敢相信他们还没来012---I can't believe they're not here.
我那么辛苦这一天是为了什么012---I slave and I slave for what?
他们毁了我的酸梅酱日012---They've ruined Cranberry Day.
我们迟到了多久012---How late are we?
45分钟012---Forty-five minutes.
-给  -好的.012---- Here. - Okay.
瑞秋和菲比应该已经到了012---Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
所以他们可能已经开始了012---so they probably started without us.
我们溜进去012---We could just slip in,
这样谁都不会注意我们的012---and no one needs to know where we were.
你不把这个泡沫大手指扔掉么012---You may want to lose the foam finger.
哦  才不呢012---Oh, no, no, no.
你只是想把它套在你手上012---You just want to put it on your hand.
你们没在里面012---You're not at Thanksgiving?
没  我们迟到了012---No, we're late.
你们在这里干什么012---What are you doing here?
我们也迟到了012---We're late too.
我们本以为我们可以迟到012---We figured we could be late
因为你们会准时到012---because you'd be on time.
别用这个指着我  姓崔的012---Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.
那...里面没人012---So nobody's here?
莫妮卡会杀了我们的012---Monica's gonna kill us.
你们到什么地方去了012---Yeah, where were you?
奖杯怎么来的012---Yeah, what's with the trophy?
嗯  我们去参加拼字大赛了012---Well, we were at a spelling bee.
我赢了012---And I won.
你在感恩节这天012---You won an adult
赢得了一场成人拼字游戏012---Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?
是  Y-E-S  是012---Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.
让我看看...012---Let me see this.
纽约区超级无敌小可爱012---"Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division"?
那便是我012---That's me.
你们让艾玛参加了选美比赛012---You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?
而且看起来她还给她化了妆012---And it looks like she put makeup on her.
等等...012---Wait a second...
我好像在什么地方见过这身牛仔...012---Where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before?
无法置信012---I can't believe this.
她是我们的女儿012---She's our daughter.
你把她当成观赏狗一样012---That you would treat her like some kind of show dog
不可饶恕012---is inexcusable.
她为我们赢得了一千美元012---She won a thousand dollars.
这比赛是一年一次的吗012---So this is an annual thing?
啊  这是艾莉西亚·梅·埃默里的服装012---That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!
伙计们  有人在里面012---Guys, there are people in there
要发火了012---who are not getting any happier.
我们该怎么办012---What are we gonna do?
我不知道  你们想办法012---I don't know, you guys figure it out.
我先把艾玛送回去睡觉012---I gotta put Emma down for a nap.
哦  瑞秋  你进去012---And, Rach, while you're in there,
给艾莉西亚·梅穿件衣服012---throw something on Alicia May.
好吧  我们该怎么说012---All right, what are we gonna say?
我们可以说  我们被抢劫了012---We'll say that we were mugged.
当有人被抢了的时候012---You can't get mad at someone
你怎么还会生他气012---who's been mugged.
不错  但你看起来不像被抢过012---Good. But you don't look like you were mugged.
不像  这样才像012---No. Here.
嘿012---Hey!
你有没有听到什么012---Do you hear something?
-他们都在外面  -让我看看012---- They're out there. - Let me see.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
他们迟到了一小时012---They're an hour late,
还在那里聊天012---and they're just standing there talking.
一切都乱套了012---Everything's so distorted.
乔伊有只大手012---It looks like Joey has a giant hand.
上面写"流浪者"012---That says "Rangers" on it.
他们去看比赛了012---They went to the game.
这下我饶不了他们012---Oh, they are in for a world of pain.
罗斯的衬衫撕坏了012---Ross' shirt is torn.
他们不但迟到  而且衣衫不整012---They're late and they're sloppy.
好了  艾玛睡下了012---All right, Emma's napping.
你的衬衫怎么了012---What happened to your shirt?
我被抢了012---I got mugged,
他们还抢走了我的口袋012---and they stole my pocket.
我们是在找借口012---We're just trying to figure out an excuse.
这样如何012---How about this?
我们可以说012---We could say that
莫妮卡告诉我们是5点  而不是4点012---Monica told us 5:00, not 4:00.
这样我们就没迟到而且很准时012---That way we're right on time.
或者  我们可以在房间里藏些迷药012---Or we could plant PCP in the apartment
打电话让警察把她抓了012---and call the cops on her.
嗯  这的确是个012---That would be a good way
下迷药的好办法012---to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
你可以就说她说的是5点012---We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.
保持自然些012---We'll just act casual.
所以我们根本没有迟到012---We're not late, we're right on time.
"我们知道你们在外面"012---"We know you're out there."
你觉得这是谁写的012---Who do you think it's from?
天啊  糟了  简直太糟了012---Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.
好吧  让我们进去面对他们吧012---Well, let's just go in there and face them.
我不要先进去012---I'm not going in first.
莫妮卡前额上的青筋肯定快爆裂了012---I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
我也讨厌啊012---I hate that thing.
那张脸就像扭曲的闪电一样012---It's like a bolt of lightning.

我不觉得这是个好主意012---I don't know if that's a good idea.
他们明显不想和我们在一起012---They don't wanna be with us.
你知道么012---You know what.
我也不想和他们一起012---I don't wanna be with them either...
但今天是感恩节012---...but it's Thanksgiving,
不想在一起也要在一起012---and we should not want to be together together.

我们别毁掉这美好的一天啊012---But let's not ruin this day.
你们如此之辛劳012---You've worked so hard.
让我们忘了这件事012---Let's move past this
一起吃一顿美好的晚餐吧012---and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
那些漂浮着的脑袋好像说得没错012---The floating heads do make a good point.
是啊  他们真的好像很抱歉012---Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
非常抱歉012---So bad.
非常抱歉012---So bad.
好吧012---Okay.
好吧  你们两个去拿甜品来012---Okay, you two go get the dessert,
我让你们进来012---and I'll let you in.
甜品012---Dessert?
是啊  我让你和菲比去取派012---Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies.
你们记得的  对吧012---You did remember, right?
"派"啊  我们以为是"奖"012---Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."
给你012---Here.
超级无敌小可爱012---"Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
恭喜012---Congratulations!
天呐  你忘了拿派012---Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
真不敢相信012---Well, I cannot believe this.
你们强迫我做饭012---You forced me to make dinner,
又迟到一小时012---you're an hour late...
居然还忘记了012---...and you forget the one little thing
我叫你们做的那一点点小事012---that I asked you to do.
真的  女孩子们  这就是你们不对了012---Really, girls, not cool.
好吧  你们男人又好到哪里去012---Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
你们说谎  去看比赛012---You lied about going to the game.
明知道会迟到012---You knew it'd make you late,
还坚持要去012---and you went anyway.
我有点烦了012---Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
我们都道歉了012---We said we're sorry.
今天是感恩节012---It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
是原谅之日012---A day of forgiveness.
是感激之日吧012---It's a day to be thankful.
小心我上去敲你012---Don't make me come up there!
现在道歉太晚了012---It's too late for apologies.
好吧  我们走012---Fine, let's just go.
我们可以不在这里吃饭012---I don't need your stupid dinner.
如果你没流口水的话012---That would be a lot more convincing
你的话可能更可信点012---if you weren't drooling.
哦  原来是你的口水012---Oh, is that what that is?
对不起012---Sorry.
伙计们  我们自己准备感恩节晚餐吧012---Come on, you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.

乔伊  这招不管用的012---Joey, that is not gonna work.
不  我是认真的012---No, seriously.
我真的被卡住了012---I'm really wedged in here.
我把你拉出来012---I'll pull you through.
好012---Okay.
住手012---Stop.
我担心会弄伤我的头012---I'm worried about damaging my head.
现在说太晚了012---It's a little late for that.
快点  帮帮忙啊012---Hurry up, you gotta do something.

我们需要点东西012---We need to get something
让他两边的脸润滑一些012---to grease the sides of his face
我们有火鸡汁012---We got turkey grease.
拿来012---Bring it.
我很抱歉012---I just want to say that I'm sorry
还把"血管"说成了一个人012---I referred to the vein as a separate person.
倒了012---Here you go.
味道不错012---Oh, that smells good.
-好了吗  -好  试试看012---- Okay? - Okay, try it.

我们必须把链条卸下来了012---We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
快点  我都感觉不到我的耳朵了012---Hurry, I can't feel my ears.
你曾经感觉到过耳朵么012---Can you ever feel your ears?
有意思012---Interesting.
钱德勒  你的工具哪里去了012---Chandler, where are your tools?
啊  我把他们落到推土机上了012---Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.
我根本也没有工具啊012---I don't have tools.

我借给了罗斯012---I lent them to Ross.

我留在车库了012---I left them at the park.
还真忍不住想逗他012---I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
我早就给他裤子里放了甘蓝菜012---I stuffed Brussels sprouts down his pants.
很好012---Nice.
好  我去接电话012---Okay, I have to get that.
当我回来的时候012---Now, when I get back,
我希望你和你的朋友们已经离开了012---I want you and your friends to be gone.
感恩节完了012---Thanksgiving is over.
"血管"说话了012---The vein has spoken.
我的头真的被卡住了012---It's really starting to hurt.
好吧  我会拉门012---Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...
然后你们努力推012---...and you guys push.
这样可能他就有足够的空隙出来了  好吧012---Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay?
好  推吧012---Okay, so push.
等下012---Just a sec.
我们正忙着012---We're kind of in the middle of something here.
别往我的裤子里面放东西012---Hey, stop putting things down my pants.
来吧  伙计们  推吧012---Come on, guys, push!
来  推  推  推012---Yeah, come on, push!
推  推012---Push! Push!
我的酸梅酱012---My cranberries!
我全身都是吃的了012---Man, I got food all over me.
真不敢相信会这样012---I can't believe what you did.
莫妮卡会杀了你的012---Monica's gonna kill you.
看  看  看012---Look! Look! Look
这个"漂脑袋"做了什么012---what the-- Look what the floating heads did!
没关系012---I don't care.
怎么了012---What's going on?
是领养中心处打来的012---That was the adoption agency.
然后012---And?
我们可以领养孩子了012---We're getting a baby!
真的么012---Are you serious?!
有个俄亥俄州的孕妇012---There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
选了我们012---and she picked us.
天呐  太棒了012---Oh, my God, that's great!
难以置信012---That's incredible.
太为你们高兴了012---I'm so happy for you.
今年的感恩节比去年好太多了012---This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
敬莫妮卡和钱德勒012---To Monica and Chandler
还有那俄亥俄州的不小心怀孕的女孩012---and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.
你们两个终于要有孩子了012---I'm just so happy
这真让我高兴012---you guys are finally getting a kid.
你们没考虑过去游行012---I know. Have you considered pageanting?
真不敢相信他们打电话来了012---I can't believe they called.
我们就会有孩子了012---I mean, we're actually getting a baby.
我能体会你们的感受012---I know how you feel.
-真的么  -当然啦012---- Really? - Sure.
买艾莉西亚·梅·埃默里时012---I went through the exact same thing
我经历过完全相同的事情012---with Alicia May Emory.
那种期待  那种迷茫012---The waiting, the wondering.
直到有一天012---Then one day,
我接到了玩具公司的电话012---I get that call from Toys"R"Us.
她又有货了012---She was in stock.
确实"完全相同"012---That is the exact same thing.
-嘿   -嘿012---- Hey.  - Hey.
我们来道别012---We're here to say goodbye.
要去俄亥俄州012---We're off to Ohio.
对哦  领养面谈012---Oh, right, your adoption interview.
是啊  我们去见未来我们孩儿他妈012---Yep. We'll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
难以置信  你们回来时012---I can't believe it. When you come back,
会带着婴儿  太奇怪了012---you'll have a baby. That is so weird.
也很不正确012---And so incorrect.
她只怀孕几个月012---She's only a couple months pregnant.
她选中了我们的申请表012---She liked our application
是否喜欢我们还不一定012---but might not like us.
她会喜欢你们的012---Come on, she's gonna love you guys.
谢谢012---Thank you.
但我们尽量不期望过高012---But we're trying not to get our hopes up.
还有很多事情挡在我们面前012---A lot could still get in our way.
她可能会决定拒绝把孩子给人领养012---She could decide against adoption,
也可能选中其他夫妇012---like another couple better.
你们打算给小孩取啥名字012---What are you gonna name it?
我就有这个本事012---I could develop a condition
费尽口舌012---in which I talk and talk
而旁人却充耳不闻012---and no one hears a word.
试想  如果一切顺利012---But just think, okay? What if everything goes right?
如果她真选了你们俩呢012---What if this woman does pick you guys?
天  那她就会选我们012---Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!
我们决心012---So we're standing firm on
决不期望过高012---"not getting our hopes up"?
我明白  有可能出差错012---No. I know things could still go wrong,
但万一顺利012---but if they don't...
如果没有问题012---...if this works out,
我们就会有孩子了  孩子012---we're gonna have a baby. A baby!
是的  但是...012---Yes. But--
会成功的012---Oh, my God. It's gonna work!
我们会成功的012---We're gonna make it work!
我要当妈妈012---I'm gonna be a mommy,

我不是气她吃我几根薯条012---Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.
你得清楚薯条的象征意义012---It's about what the fries represent.
-啥  -所有食物012---- What?  - All food!
对不起012---Well, I'm sorry.
竟然介绍你012---I can't believe I set you up
和这么个"怪物"约会012---with such a monster!
我带女孩吃饭012---Hey, look, I take a girl out...
她点什么都可以012---...she can order whatever she wants.
越多越好012---The more the better, all right?
但不可以自己012---Just don't order
只点沙拉却夺我的食物012---a garden salad and then eat my food!
这么做有可能被切手指的012---That's a good way to lose some fingers.
谢天谢地你来了  你来评评理012---Thank God you're here. Listen to this.
怎么了012---What?
乔伊昨晚约我朋友012---Joey and my friend are out last night,
在吃晚饭的时候012---having dinner, and she reaches over...
-她伸手拿他的薯条  -哦  不012---- ...and takes a few of his fries--  - Oh, no!
这有什么012---What?
你知道这条规则012---You know about the plate thing?
是是  乔伊从不分享食物012---Oh, yeah, yeah. No, Joey doesn't share food.
上星期我们一起吃早餐012---I mean, just last week we were having breakfast...
他盘里有些葡萄012---...and he had a couple grapes on his plate.
你不让她吃葡萄012---You wouldn't let her have a grape?
不  不是我012---No, not me.
是艾玛012---Emma.
乔伊从不分享食物012---Joey doesn't share food!
我还是坚持认为就因为这件破事012---Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
放弃她很不明智012---not to call someone again.
你再约她  好吧012---You are calling her, okay?
如果有必要012---And if you need to,
干脆再点一盘薯条不就完了012---then just get an extra plate of fries for the table.
这主意不错012---I like that.
共享缓冲区012---A sharing buffer. Yeah.
多点一盘薯条012---Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
再点一盘洋葱012---Maybe a plate of onion rings.
好  好012---Yeah. Yeah.
还要鸡尾虾012---And a shrimp cocktail.
再要些辣鸡翅012---And some Buffalo wings.
或许  一个披萨012---Maybe.... Maybe an individual pizza, huh?
和炸干酪牛肉棒012---And some mozzarella sticks.
我们在谈什么012---What were we talking about?
这地方太好了012---Wow, this place is awesome.
我们还是走吧012---We should just go.
我在这淘不到什么的012---I'm not gonna find anything here.
这的东西都太可笑了012---This stuff is ridiculous.
这地方简直太赞了012---Oh, this place is great!
瑞秋  我才不会穿这个012---Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this.
我才不穿银色的012---Nothing silver.
-为什么   -有毛毛的012---- Why?  - Okay, nothing with hair.
更不穿带挂锁的012---And nothing with padlocks on it!
罗斯  看看012---Ross, look. Look,
我知道肯定能挑出几件的012---I know that some of this stuff is out there.
但你看这  看看这个012---But I mean, come on, look at this.
看看这件毛衣012---Look at this sweater.
你看多好看012---I mean, this is just beautiful.
是很柔软012---Wow, this is really soft.
350元012---350 dollars?
从700块打折下来012---Down from 700.
你差不多省了200块呢012---You're saving, like, 200 bucks.
今天逻辑学和数学012---Both logic and math
都饱受摧残012---are taking a serious hit today.
这件好  很衬你012---Hey, check this out. It's totally you.
哇哦  这件看起来不错012---Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.
是啊012---Yeah.
《男孩就是男孩》012---"Boys will be boys"?
-本来就是   -好好012---- What? They will be!  - All right.
算了  我走012---That's it, I'm getting out of here.
别  罗斯  等等嘛012---No, Ross, wait, come on.
还有其他的呢012---There's other stuff here.
衬衣和裤子都不错012---There's some nice shirts, these nice pants.
其实  这些看起来挺适合我012---Actually, these might look pretty good on me.
嗯  是的  你知道你应该干嘛么012---Yes, they will. You know what you should do?
你随便转转先012---Go take a walk.
我知道你尺码,012---All right? I know your size,
我帮你挑些上等货色012---and I'll pick out some really good stuff for you.
-当真   -对012---- Really?  - Yes.
我知道男人穿什么最性感012---I know what looks sexy on guys.
穿我推荐的衣服012---Just wear what I suggest,
不迷死她才怪012---and she is gonna go nuts for you.
你是说...012---So you're saying...
我若穿这条裤子012---...if I wear these pants,
她会允许我侵犯012---I might be getting into hers?
为什么男人老跟我来这套012---Why do men keep talking to me like this?
我是医生012---So the fact that I'm a doctor
我太太是牧师012---and my wife's a reverend...
这对你很重要012---...that's important to you?
是啊  很多申请人都很优秀012---Yeah. I read some great applications...
但是我想012---...but I thought,
带孩子谁能比得上牧师012---"Who better than a minister to raise a child?"
阿门012---Amen.
另外  我觉得把孩子交给个医生是很好的012---Plus, I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor.
很好的一双手012---Good hands.
疗伤圣手012---Healing hands.
牧师  我能问一下012---Reverend, can I ask?
圣经上对领养孩子怎么说吗012---Does the Bible say anything about adoption?
但做无妨012---It says, "Do it."
她让他们领养了一个婴孩（模仿圣经句式  原为"你要怀孕生子  可以给他起名叫耶稣"）012---"And behold, she did adopt unto them a baby.
此乃善举012---And it was good."
-哇  -是啊  我也哇012---- Wow.  - Yeah, wow.
我在想  你们工作都责任重大012---I was wondering-- You both have such serious jobs.
你有时间兼顾孩子和你的教友吗012---Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
我的教友  我的教友们没事儿012---Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.
这个时候  我的教友都是自己照顾自己012---Yeah. My flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point.
好教友  教友...012---Good flock. Flock...
当医生很花时间吧012---But being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time.
我的情况不同012---Not for me it doesn't.
谈得如何012---So how's everything going in here?
太棒了012---We're great.
我想问题我都问完了012---I think I may have asked all my questions.
很好  你们有什么要问她012---Good. Do you have questions for Erica?
我想问问012---Yeah, actually.
你读到满意的申请表012---So you read a file that you liked...
然后告诉代理人编号012---...and then you gave the agency the serial number
然后他们联系到我们012---and they contacted us?
我们的系统中用户完全匿名012---Yes. Our system ensures total anonymity.
我们以此为荣012---We're very proud of it.
应该骄傲012---You should be.
真的是一流012---You're really on top of stuff.
别的没什么了012---Well then, if there's nothing else,
那我们俩谈谈012---then the two of us should talk.
实际上…012---I actually....
-我想我们不必谈了 -为什么不012---- I don't think we have to. - We don't?
我看了你们的档案012---Yeah, when I read about you two,
就确定要选你们012---I was pretty sure I wanted you...
但还想当面见见你们012---...but I just thought we should meet face to face.
我决定了012---I've made my decision.
就选他们012---I choose them.
哦  天啊  太棒了012---Oh, my God, this is great.
太棒了  听见吗012---This is so great. Did you hear that?
是的  听见了012---Yeah, I did.
嘿012---Hey.
谢谢  太谢谢了012---Thank you. Thank you so much.
你将来一定进天堂012---You are so going to heaven!
我们买了些很棒的东西012---We got some really great stuff.
对012---Yeah.
但是  有些胸罩似乎不妥012---Yeah, but I'm not sure about some of the bras I got.
真的  你能穿上试给我看吗012---Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me?
好012---Okay.
等一下  我们是在乔伊的幻想里吗012---Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
糟糕  错拿罗斯一袋012---Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags by mistake.
我那件不见了012---And one of mine is missing.
肯定在罗斯那里012---Ross probably has it.
找他拿回来好了012---You'll get it from him later.
你觉得如何012---So, what do you think?
这下我们再也撞不了衫了012---I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore.
对  瑞秋帮我选的012---Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.
她让我相信她012---She told me to trust her, and you know what?
真高兴我答应了012---I'm glad I did.
一路过来回头率暴高012---I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
老兄  别穿成这样012---Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
我明白012---I see.
有人怕我抢走了女人的目光012---Somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
看起来好用某人就是个女人了012---Looks like someone is the ladies!
你嫉妒  因为你不能把这件扒下来012---You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.
现在失陪了  我约会去012---Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date.
看到没  大家都只看我012---See? All eyes on me!
不能签012---We are not signing those papers.
为啥012---Why not?
这样做不对  他们搞错了012---It's wrong. They made a mistake.
当我们是别人012---They think we're somebody else.
上帝的安排  凡人懂什么012---God works in mysterious ways.
别再冒充了012---You have got to stop.
但她喜欢我们012---But she liked us.
她喜欢的是钱德勒医生012---She likes Doctor Chandler
和莫妮卡牧师012---and Reverend Monica.
如果你想一下012---If you think about it,
我其实满像牧师012---I'm kind of like a reverend.
作为主厨  我给饥饿的人和穷人提供食物012---I mean, as a chef, I serve God
这不也是为上帝服务012---by feeding the hungry and poor.
你们一份小牛排卖34块9毛5012---Your veal chop is 34.95!
得了012---Come on,
幸福来敲门了012---I just-- I think we've been given an opportunity.
不如将错就错012---The mistake's already made.
他们已经在写书面报告了012---They're writing up the papers now.
但我们不是她要选的人012---But we're not the ones she chose.
你竟然理直气壮012---How can you feel okay about this?
因为…012---Because.
虽然我们不是她选中的人012---We may not be who she thinks we are...
但没人会比我们更爱那个小娃娃012---...but no one will ever love that baby more than us.
-我明白  -我的意思是012---- I know.  - I mean, who knows...
谁知道我们到底还要等多久012---...how long it's gonna take for someone else
才会有人再选我们012---to give us a baby?
万一永远没人选我们012---What if no one ever picks us?
哦  亲爱的012---Oh, honey....
求你了012---Please?
求你了  我们就快要成功了012---Please. We are so close.
莫妮卡  我也想要孩子012---Monica, I want a baby too.
但她要送出他的心肝宝贝012---But this woman is giving away her child.
她应该知道对方的真实身份012---She deserves to know who it's going to.
好吧  你说的没错012---Okay. You're right.
我们告诉她真相012---So we'll tell the truth.
但是谁知道呢012---And who knows, you know?
没准她会因为我们告诉她真相而喜欢我们012---Maybe she'll like us for us.
或许她会012---Maybe she will.
我怎么就不是牧师呢012---Why couldn't I have been a reverend?
你是犹太教的012---You're Jewish.
差别不大012---Technicality!

好的012---Okay, then.
你捣什么乱012---Now look what you did!
什么  不怎么了012---What? What is the matter with you?
我不喜欢012---I don't like it
别人抢我盘子里的东西吃012---when people take food off of my plate, okay?
但你说过"我的就是你的"012---But you said, "What's mine is yours."
我那是客气012---Well, I didn't mean it!
好吧  对不起012---Fine. Sorry,
没想到你这么在乎012---I didn't think it was that big a deal.
不  我很抱歉012---No, I'm sorry. I....
是我反应过激了012---I'm overreacting, okay?
在食物方面012---It's just, when it comes to food, l...
我有一些戒律012---...have certain rules...
我是说012---...okay? I mean...
有些事可以做012---...there are things you do,

你会喜欢的012---Oh, you are gonna love it.
真高兴我们终于能一起吃饭了012---And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
-我也是  -我来012---- Me too.  - Here.
真有趣012---So this was fun.
刚才的事真抱歉012---I really am sorry about, you know, before.
你一定要知道012---And I want to make sure you know
我真的喜欢你012---I really do like you.

干嘛012---What are you doing?
你不是不和人分享食物012---I thought you don't share food?
才没有012---Sure I do.
覆盆子酱汁012---Coulis?
不  我都不能吃你的蛤蚌012---No. If I can't have your clams,
你也不能碰我的甜品012---you can't have my dessert.
规则是双向的012---This is a two-way street.
是吗012---Really?
是的012---Really.
我回来时希望它完好无损012---Now this all better be here when I come back.
当然  我能控制自己012---Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
别再瞪着我012---Stop staring at me!
就一小口012---Just a tiny little....

医生快看012---Look, doctor.
签字前012---Look, before we sign anything,
我们得谈谈012---we really have to talk.
我们不是你选中的夫妇012---We're not who you think we are.
什么意思012---I don't understand.
领养机构肯定出了什么错012---The agency must have made a mistake.
我太太不是牧师012---My wife is not a reverend,
我不是医生012---and I'm not a doctor.
-啊   -不可能012---- What? - That's impossible.
如果你愿意  我可以替你开刀012---I could perform an operation on you
向你证明012---and prove it if you'd like.
我去查档案  失陪012---I have to check your file. Excuse me.
你们到底是谁012---So who are you?
我们是叫莫妮卡和钱德勒  纽约来的012---Our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
但重要的是012---Yeah, but the important thing to know about us...
我们真的很爱这个小孩012---...is how much we would care for this little baby.
你们先前跟我撒谎012---So you lied to me before?
我们"犯了伪证罪"012---Well, we "bore false witness."
看  我真有当牧师的天赋012---See? I could be a reverend.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
我们希望说明真相后012---But we were hoping that since we told you the truth...
你能网开一面...012---...that you still might consider--
把我的宝贝给你们012---Giving you my baby?
发生这一切后  你们以为还会给你们012---You think I'd give you my child after this?
不必马上决定012---You don't have to decide now.
请看看我们的档案012---If you look at our file--

艾瑞卡  请等等012---Erica, wait.
我跟你无话可说012---I have nothing to say to you.
你有任何理由生气012---Look, you have every reason to be upset.
我们是撒了谎012---We did lie.
但那是因为012---But only because we've been waiting
我们想要个孩子等太久了012---and trying to have a baby for so long.
我们也不知道下一个机会012---And we don't know how long it's gonna be
何年何月才会到来012---before we get another chance again.
让你的牧师祈祷去吧012---Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
艾瑞卡  求你了012---Erica, please.
考虑一下我们吧012---Just consider us.

我的确喜欢你们012---I actually liked you guys.
但已经不重要了012---But it doesn't matter.
你们不该撒谎012---Because what you did was wrong.
但你喜欢我们对不对012---But you did like us.
你也应该喜欢我们012---And you should.
我太太是个很了不起的女人012---My wife's an incredible woman.
她有爱心  乐于奉献  关怀他人012---She is loving, and devoted and caring.
别告诉她我这么说过012---And don't tell her I said this,
但她一贯正确012---but the woman's always right.
我爱我太太胜过世上一切事物012---I love my wife more than anything in this world.
所以...012---And it...
不能给她个孩子我难受死了012---It kills me that I can't give her a baby.

有了孩子以后012---And when that day finally comes,
我会学习如何做是个好爸爸012---I'll learn how to be a good dad.
但我太太...012---But my wife...
她已经是个好妈妈012---...she's already there.
她是一个妈妈012---She's a mother...
可惜没孩子012---...without a baby.
求你了012---Please?
你还想要那个孩子吗012---You still want that baby?
上帝保佑你  钱德勒·宾012---God bless you, Chandler Bing!

不太好012---Not so good.

如果你必须放弃一样的话012---If you had to,
你会放弃哪一样儿012---what would you give up,
食物还是性爱012---food or sex?
性爱012---Sex.
说真的012---Seriously,
你回答得也太快了吧012---answer faster.
对不起  亲爱的012---Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
她刚才说的性爱012---But when she said "sex,"
我没想到是指和你一起的性爱012---I wasn't thinking about sex with you.
好象我还受了很大恩惠似的012---It's like a giant hug.
罗斯  你呢012---Ross, how about you?
你会放弃哪一样  性爱还是食物012---Which would you give up?
食物012---Food.
那如果是性爱和恐龙呢012---How about sex or dinosaurs?
老天啊012---Oh, my God,
这简直就像《苏菲的选择》012---it's like Sophie's Choice.
哦  天啊012---Oh, God.
乔伊  你放弃什么012---What about you, Joe?
性爱还是食物012---What would you give up, sex or food?
我不知道  这太难取舍了012---I don't know, it's too hard.
不行  你必须得选一个012---No, you gotta pick one.
食物  不  性爱012---Food. No, sex.
食物  性爱  食物  性爱…012---Food. Sex. Food. Sex--
我不知道  老天  我都想要012---I don't know! Oh, God, I want both!
我要坐在面包上的妞儿012---I want-- I want girls on bread!
《老友记》  第十季  第10集 钱德勒被"捉奸"012---Friends S10E10 The One Where Chandler Gets Caught
你看看艾玛这些新照片012---You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
哇  真可爱啊012---Oh, how cute!
她看上去就象个洋娃娃012---She looks just like a little doll.
不不  那就是个洋娃娃012---Oh, no, that is a doll.
噢  感谢上帝012---Oh, thank God,
因为我觉得它看上去有点吓人012---because that thing's really creepy.
钱德勒在那儿012---Look, there's Chandler.
噢  那个金发女郎是谁012---Who's the blond?
她很漂亮012---She's pretty.
他有外遇了012---He's having an affair.
他才不是有外遇呢012---He is not having an affair!
你知道的啦  我在这事儿上面感觉很准的012---I'm always right about these things.
不  你才没有呢012---No, you're not.
上周你还在想罗斯想把你宰了012---Last week, you thought Ross was trying to kill you.
对不起012---Well, sorry,
但确实很让人难以相信012---but it's hard to believe
如果不是真的012---that anyone would tell a story that dull...
谁会讲那么无聊的事012---...just to tell it.
我敢发誓他们俩之间肯定有些什么事012---There's something going on with them.
快看  他们俩上了同一部车012---Look! He's getting into the car with her.
那并不能说明什么012---That doesn't mean anything.
是吗  让我们走着瞧012---Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.
喂  趴低点012---Okay, duck down.
-喂  -嗨  钱德勒  我是菲比012---- Hello? - Hi, Chandler. It's Phoebe.
我知道今天莫尼卡要上班012---I know that Monica is working today...
所以我想你要不要012---...so I was wondering if you wanted to
跟我和瑞秋一起去看电影012---come to the movies with me and Rachel.
噢  我也得上班012---Oh, I have to work too.
我这一天在办公室也走不开012---Yeah, I'm stuck here at the office all day.
太可惜了  你不能去看电影012---Well, it's a shame that you'll miss the movie...
因为我们打算看012---...because we were gonna see, you know,
《骗子  骗子》012---either Liar Liar...

《老兄  我的车呢》012---Dude, Where's My Car?
-什么  -他们现在在车里012---- What? - They're in a car.
好了  迟点再跟你说  再见012---Okay. Well, talk to you later, okay? Bye.
快012---Okay, quick.
我们得拦辆出租车跟踪他们012---We gotta find a cab and follow them.
好的012---Yeah, okay.
我得先去拿我的夜视镜和眩晕枪012---Let me just grab my night-vision goggles and my stun gun.
我这儿有012---I got them.
-嘿  -嗨  亲爱的012---- Hey. - Hey. Hi, sweetie.
你身上有香水和烟的味道012---Hey, you smell like perfume and cigarettes.
我今天和南茜在车里面呆了一天012---I was in the car with Nancy.
南茜可不抽烟012---Nancy doesn't smoke.
香水不是我的012---Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
你就应该谢天谢地了012---Be thankful for that.
那么  你认为那房子怎么样012---So.... What did you think of the house?
简直太棒了  就是我们一直以来要找的012---It's everything we've been looking for.
是吗  那些漂亮的方木涂层012---Isn't it? And what about the amazing wanes coating...
拱形屋顶以及阁楼上的天窗012---...the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
还有蠕虫和爬虫012---And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps!
你刚刚在说什么012---What were the things you said?
你喜欢那个大院子吗012---Don't you love the huge yard?
还有睡房里的壁炉012---The fireplace in the bedroom.
南茜还说这个价钱非常优惠012---And Nancy said it's really underpriced...
因为那家伙丢了工作012---...because the guy lost his job
不得不搬去跟父母住  所以急于出手012---and has to move in with his parents!
看把你兴奋的012---This is bringing out a lovely color in you.
你认为我们是不是应该把它买下来012---So do you think we should get it?
我不知道  你怎么想012---I don't know. What do you think?
我想我们应该买下来012---I think we should.
我也这么想012---I do too.
这是很大件事012---This is huge.
你有多想抽烟012---How bad do you wanna smoke right now?
我不知道你在说什么012---I don't know what you mean,
大只会说话的香烟012---giant, talking cigarette.
对了  我正在南茜车上的时候012---Phoebe called as I was getting
菲比打电话来了012---into Nancy's car.
如果她问起就说我一天都在工作012---If she asks you, I was at work all day.
明白  你打算什么时候跟他们说这件事012---Got you. When do we tell them?
先不告诉  没有十成的把握012---We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.
干嘛弄得大家都难受012---Why upset everybody over nothing?
嗯  好的012---Okay. Right.
天啊  这将非常难以开口012---Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
我知道  所以祝你顺利吧012---I know. Good luck with it.
我就是不明白钱德勒为什么搞外遇012---I just can't see Chandler cheating.
告诉你们吧  我们一直跟踪他们012---I'm telling you guys, we followed them
到一所位于韦斯特切斯特的房子的外面012---out to a house in Westchester.
他们在里面待了有45分钟012---They went in for 45 minutes,
出来的时候两人看上去都很高兴012---and then they came out looking pretty happy.
钱德勒012---Chandler?
45分钟012---Forty-five minutes?
肯定有什么地方不对012---Well, something's not right.
我不敢相信他这样对莫尼卡012---I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.
是啊  而且他们就快有小孩儿了012---I know, and with the baby coming?
那我们该不该告诉莫尼卡012---So should we tell her?
我不知道012---I don't know.
菲比  如果我们看到迈克跟另一个女人在一起012---Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman,
我们应不应该告诉你012---would you want us to tell you?
什么  你看到他跟谁在一起了012---Why? Who'd you see him with?
没有  我只是说012---No one. I'm just saying if we did--
告诉我你知道些什么012---Tell me what you know!
没谁  没有012---No one! Nothing!
迈克是个好人  我只是在假设012---Mike's a great guy! It was hypothetical!
好了  他是个好人012---All right. He is a good guy.
你是对的  他不会搞外遇012---You're right. He wouldn't cheat.
如果我真看到他跟另一个女人在一起012---If I did see him with someone,
我也绝不会012---there's no way l--
你看见他跟谁在一起了012---Who did you see him with?
看看她  多开心啊012---Oh, look at her. So happy.
要是有更小的012---If only there were a smaller one
来清理这个该有多好012---to clean this one.
钱德勒在吗012---Hey, is Chandler here?
不在  他去买饭了012---No, he's picking up dinner.
怎么了  出什么事了吗012---Why? What's up?
无论发生什么事012---Look, whatever happens,
我们都跟你在一起  我们爱你012---we're here for you, and we love you.
好012---All right.
我想钱德勒可能有外遇了012---Chandler might be having an affair.
什么012---What?
菲比和我今天012---Phoebe and I saw Chandler...
在街上012---...with a blond woman today
看见钱德勒和一个金发女郎在一起012---outside on the street.
然后我们跟踪他们到了012---And then we followed them
一所位于韦斯特切斯特的房子012---to a house in Westchester.
他们一起进去了012---They went in together.
很抱歉012---I'm so sorry.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我的天啊  这太糟糕了012---Oh, my God, that's awful.
你们觉得那房子怎么样012---What did you think of the house?
什么012---What?
莫尼卡  你明白012---Monica, you understand
我们刚才说的话  对不对012---what we're saying, right?
明白  当然明白012---Yeah. Sure.
明显对我是毁灭性的打击012---I mean, I'm devastated, obviously.
你们觉得那附近住人舒服不012---Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
嘿012---Hey.
你这个狗杂种012---You son of a bitch.
只是我自己这么觉得012---Is it me,
还是我们打招呼的用语012---or have the greetings
真的在走下坡路012---gone downhill around here?
菲比和瑞秋今天看见012---Phoebe and Rachel saw you
你和南茜在一起012---with Nancy today.
他们以为你和她有一腿012---They think you're having an affair.
谁是南茜012---Who's Nancy?
到底是怎么回事012---What's going on?
好的012---Okay....
好的  好的  伙计们  坐下说话012---All right, you better sit down.
这是件大事012---This is-- This is pretty big.
是的012---Yeah.
我没有外遇012---I'm not having an affair.
南茜是我们的房地产经纪012---Nancy is our realtor.
我就知道他不可能012---I knew he couldn't be with a woman
跟一个女人做45分钟那么长012---for 45 minutes!
你们为什么要请地产经纪012---Why do you have a realtor?
最近以来她带着我们012---She's been showing us houses
去看郊区的房子012---outside of the city.
什么012---What?
你是说真的012---Are you serious?
当我们发现我们012---When we found out
马上就要有小孩儿了012---that we were gonna get this baby...
我和钱德勒商量过了012---...Chandler and I decided
我们决定不能在市区抚养我们的小孩儿012---we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
所以你们要搬出去012---So you're-- So you're gonna move?
我的天012---Oh, my God.
这种事我们总要投票解决吧012---Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?
在市区里带小孩儿有什么不妥吗012---What is wrong with raising a kid in the city?
我就这样啊012---I'm doing it.
罗斯也这样012---Ross is doing it.
莎拉·杰西卡·派克也是这么干的012---Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
对你们来说这没什么问题012---And that's great for you guys,
但是我们想要给孩子一片草地和一个的秋千012---but we want a lawn and a swing set.
还有一条小孩012---A street where our kids
可以在上面骑单车的马路012---can ride their bikes...
不时还会有雪糕车经过012---...and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
所以你们想买一栋50年代的房子012---So you want to buy a house in the '50s.
你们有没有想过012---Have you thought about
你们正放弃什么012---what you're giving up?
你们不能搬出市区  如果...012---You can't move out of the city. What if--?
如果你们想凌晨五点钟吃中餐怎么办012---What if you want Chinese food at 5 a.m.?
又或者想买一块012---Or a fake Rolex
一下雨就散架的假劳力士怎么办012---that breaks as soon as it rains?
又或者一个电话就能到的012---Or an Asian hooker
亚洲应召女郎呢012---sent right to your door?
知道吗012---You know what?
如果你们只是想看看房子  没问题012---If you want to look for a house, that's okay.
不  不  不  别听他的012---No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him.
小心我扁你012---I'm gonna thump you.
的确是没问题012---It's okay,
因为他们必须得把想搬走的这心情发泄出来012---because they have to get it out of their system.
你们会发现012---Okay? But you're gonna realize
这里才是你们真正想要住的地方012---this is the only place you want to be.
实际上...012---Actually...
我们已经找到合我们心意的房子了012---...we already found a house we love.
什么012---What?
大约一小时以前012---About an hour ago,
我们开出了我们的价码012---we made an offer.
我想你们现在012---Bet you wish I was having
宁可我有外遇了吧012---an affair now, huh?
你们已经开出价码了012---You put an offer on a house?
那房子真的很好012---It's so sweet.
的确是012---It really is.
那里有一个很大的院子012---It has this big yard
一直通到一条小溪012---that leads down to this stream.
那里还有很多老枫树012---And then there's these old maple trees.
跟自然环境有什么关系012---Oh, again with the nature.
你们又不是海狸012---What are you, beavers?
我知道你们一时很难接受我们的决定012---Look, I know this is really hard,
我们也非常的抱歉012---and we're really sorry.
是不是因为我常不敲门012---Is this because I come over here
就过来拿你们的东西吃?012---without knocking and eat your food?
我可以不那样做012---Because I can stop doing that.
我真的可以改012---I really, really think I can.
乔伊  你知道这不是我们要搬出去住的原因012---You know that's not the reason, Joe.
我想如果你们到实地看一看的话012---I think if you saw it,
你们会明白的012---you'd understand.
你们俩去看过012---You guys were there.
那的确很美  不是吗012---It's beautiful, isn't it?
是  确实是很美012---Yeah, it is.
你在干什么012---What the hell are you doing?
的确是  好吧012---Well, it is, all right?
我们今天到那儿的时候012---When we were out there today,
我所想的是012---all I kept thinking was:
我简直不敢相信012---"l can't believe Chandler's
钱德勒在和那女人干那事儿012---screwing this woman...
但是住这地方也太好了012---...but, man, this would be a nice place to live!"
是  但住这也很好啊012---Yeah, but so is this.
对  我是说012---Yeah. I mean,
如果你们搬到那里去住012---if you move there,
你们就得离开这儿了012---you have to leave here.
你们怎么能离开这个地方012---I mean, how can you leave this place?
老爸  你听我说012---Come on, Daddy, listen!
从生下来  人们就跟我说012---All my life, everyone's always told me,
"你是一只鞋"012---"You're a shoe!"
"你是一只鞋012---"You're a shoe!
你是一只鞋012---You're a shoe.

今天我停下来说012---I stopped and said,
"如果我不想当只鞋子会怎样012---"What if I don't want to be a shoe?
如果我想做一个钱包012---What if I want to be a purse?
或是顶帽子"012---Or a hat?"
不  我不是要你给我买顶帽子012---I don't want you to buy me a hat, l--
我是说我是一顶…012---I'm saying I am a ha-
我只是打个比方  老爸012---It's a metaphor, Daddy!
你知道他的问题在哪里了012---You can see where he'd have trouble.
好吧  也许我就跟莫尼卡住在这儿012---Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
我想我们已经就谁012---I guess we've established
和莫尼卡住在一起这个问题达成了共识012---she's staying with Monica.
你的钱马上归我啦  格林小姐012---Your money's mine, Greene.
你的尿门没拉上  盖勒先生012---Your fly's open, Geller.
伙计们  知道我刚发现了什么吗012---You know what I just realized?
Joker是带"J"的Poker012---"Joker" is "poker" with a "J"!
巧合吧012---Coincidence?
嗯  那是带"C"的"joincidence"012---That's "joincidence" with a "C"!
呃  看012---Look!

我被卡住了012---It's stuck!
别着急  小心阶梯012---Step.
你怎么会把头给套进去了012---How did it get on?
我想把它戴上去吓吓钱德勒012---I put it on to scare Chandler.
我的天012---Oh, my God!
莫尼卡会被吓死的012---Monica's going to totally freak out!
还有  这里面难闻得要命012---Plus, it smells really bad in here.
那是当然了012---Of course it smells bad.
你脑袋伸到火鸡的屁股里面去了012---You have your head up a turkey's ass.
莫尼卡012---Monica.
嗨  你们把火鸡...012---Did you get the turkey--?

我会在上面贴个标签012---I'm just gonna label it

在钱德勒身上也写上这句话012---and write that on Chandler.
二位  我不想把事情搞砸012---Guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but...
但是我不想跟瑞秋住在一起了012---...l don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
-什么  -什么012----What? -What?
你们对对方太刻薄了012---You're so mean to each other.
我也不想像现在这样  弄得跟瑞秋不欢而散012---I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel.
我还是喜欢你012---I still like you.
菲比  那没关系  因为我不搬了012---That's fine because I'm not moving.
菲比  你得跟把她带走012---Phoebe, you gotta take her.
你知道  我是曾说过一些她的坏话012---You know, I know I said some bad stuff...
但是  瑞秋还是有很多优点的012---...but Rachel has qualities
这足以让她成为一个好的室友012---that make her a good roommate.
她有很多商品目录012---She gets tons of catalogs and she folds

还有  当我告诉她012---And when I told her
我要搬过去跟钱德勒一起住的时候012---that I was gonna move in with Chandler...
她真的是很支持我012---...she was really supportive.
你太好了012---You were so great.
你把一件困难的事情变得轻松简单012---You made it so easy.
但现在你却要走了012---And now you have to leave.

我知道这并不是012---I know this isn't exactly
你们所计划的感恩节012---the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...
但对于我来说  这个节真的是太棒了012---...but for me this has been really great.
知道吗  可能是因为这个节012---You know, I think because
没有人离婚012---it didn't involve divorce...
吐得一塌糊涂012---...or projectile vomiting.
无论怎样  我只是在想012---Anyway, I think if
如果你们去了韦尔县012---you had gone to Vail...
如果你们和你们的家人在一起012---...or if you had been with your family,
如果你"没有"012---or if you didn't have...
梅毒什么的012---...syphilis and stuff...
我们就不可能在一起  对不对012---...we wouldn't be all together.
所以  我想我要说的是012---So I guess what I'm trying to say is...
我很感激你们012---...that I'm very thankful
因为你们的感恩节计划全砸了012---that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
-太感人了  -谢啦012---- That's so sweet! - Thank you.

知道吗012---You know,
有时我独自一人在我的寓所的时候012---sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment,
望向这边012---I look over here...
你们正在吃晚餐012---...and you guys are just having dinner...
看电视或是做着其它什么事012---...or watching TV or something...
这会让我感觉好很多012---...but it makes me feel better.
你们搬走后  我再望过来的时候012---And now when I look over,
我会看到谁012---who am I gonna see?
张三  李四  王二麻子012---The Gottliebs? The Yangs?
他们不会让我感觉如此之好012---They don't make me feel so good.
是啊  所以别搬了012---Yeah. So don't move, okay?
对  就留下吧012---Just stay here...

你怎么这么长时间才约我012---So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
呃  这听起来有些愚蠢  但是...012---Oh, well, this is gonna sound kind of silly...
你还记得我的室友 钱德勒·宾012---...but do you remember my roommate, Chandler Bing?

已经16年了012---It's been 16 years,
不过那个引号还是挺伤人的012---but the air quotes still hurt.
对不起012---Sorry.
没关系012---That's okay. Anyway....
总之  我们那时都很喜欢你012---Well, he and I both really liked you a lot...
但是我们又不想012---...but we didn't want it
为此伤友谊012---to jeopardize our friendship,
所以我们约定012---so we made a pact...
谁也不能跟你约会012---...that neither of us could ask you out.

好吧  我们原来不知道你想要脱衣舞男012---We didn't know you wanted a stripper,
所以我们借助于电话簿012---so we went to the phone book...
找到第一个名字就打了过去012---...and got the first name we could find.
你们的电话簿有多老了012---How old's your phone book?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God,
这个男人要在我的公寓里脱光光012---this man is gonna get naked in my apartment.
上帝  不要012---God, no.
我可不想看他跳脱衣舞012---I don't wanna see him take his clothes off.

她躲我012---She cringed.
我兴奋的时候  就是这样的012---This is how I look when I'm turned-on.
你们刚才就是在说我012---You were talking about me before.
我可不需要这些012---Look, I don't need this.
我要走了  我的帽子呢012---I'm out of here. Where's my hat?
我干这行已经很长时间了012---Look, I've been in this business for a long time.

我可不是能一次完成的012---I can take them two at a time.
我不管012---I don't care.
我们才不会就为这个付给你300块钱012---We're not paying you $300 for this.
那好  你那么保守012---It's not my fault
欣赏不了男性的身材和魅力012---if you're too uptight to appreciate...
这又不是我的错012---...the male form in all its glory.
哦  是  我保守012---Okay, I'm uptight.

失陪一下012---Excuse me.
你那么说  让我们听起来一点不像同性恋012---That didn't make us sound gay at all.
你违反了君子协定012---You broke the pact.
罗斯  那是16年前的事了012---Ross, that was 16 years ago.
那也不行012---That doesn't matter.

酷012---Cool.
我以为你不知道012---I didn't know you knew about that.

所以我才写了《在休息室被背叛》那首歌012---That's when I wrote the song "Betrayal in the Common Room."
嘿  对不起012---Man, I'm sorry.
好了  那都是陈年往事了012---Look, that was a long time ago.

还有一件事012---One more thing.
那晚我特生你的气012---I was so pissed at you that night,
想报复你012---I wanted to get back at you.

本来周末他可以放假 来参加明天的婚礼012---He was supposed to get a weekend furlough so he could go to the wedding.
可是他刚刚打电话来…012---But he just called and...
看来刺杀其他犯人的活动 不能等到星期一才办012---Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.
- 所以他不能来？ - 对012---- So he can't come? - No.
所以没有人陪我走过走道，然后…012---And so there's no one to walk me down the aisle. And...
如果你能陪我，我会很开心012---Well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
- 你说真的？ - 当然012---- Seriously? - Yeah.
你待我就跟父亲一样012---You've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me.
我是说，你一直很照顾我 也常和我分享生活智慧012---You've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom.
我的确很有〝雅慧〞012---I am pretty "wisdomous."
你愿意吗？012---So, what do you say?
你开玩笑吗？菲比，这是我的荣幸012---Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
谢谢012---PHOEBE: Oh, thank you.
我希望…012---I hope...
我希望你了解 你对我有多重要012---I hope you know how much you mean to me.
听着，我也希望…012---Listen, I hope...
我也希望你知道…012---I hope that you know...
不能让你看见老爸哭，回房间去012---I don't want you to see your father cry. Go to your room!
《老友记》  第十季  第12集  菲比的婚礼012---Friends S10E12 The One With Phoebe's Wedding
不必了…老爸请客012---- Oh. - Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.
又是我的婚礼策划人 她快把我搞疯了012---Oh. It's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!
喂？不要尖叫012---Hello? Okay, stop screaming!
好，那就比目鱼012---Okay, so halibut.
好，那就换鲑鱼 随便，我不知道…012---All right, so salmon. Either way. I don't...
- 我不在乎 - 可是我在乎012---- It doesn't matter to me. - Well, it matters to me!
我不在乎，你选就好012---Well, I don't care. So you pick.
你刚刚挂我电话吗？012---Did you just hang up on me?
听着，我要你在1800时 到晚餐预演012---All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
好…那是几点？012---Okay. What time is that?
你听不懂军事时间代码？012---You don't know military time?
那天我正好在接受导弹训练012---I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
减掉12012---Just subtract 12.
好，1800减12…012---Okay, so 1800 minus 12...
就是1788012---...is 1788.
- 六点 - 好012---- Six o'clock! - Okay.
等等…我是盖勒012---Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.
不，我说四点就要送达，再见012---No, I said it has to be there by 4:00. Goodbye.
做个冰雕是有多难？012---How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?
冰雕？这样太隆重了012---That sounds really fancy.
我说只要简单的婚礼就好012---I told you, I just want a simple wedding.
拜托，甜心，细节交给我就好012---Please, honey, leave the details to me.
我会竭尽所能让你成到宾至如归012---Now, I wanna make this day as special for you as I can.
我想让竖琴师穿白色012---I was thinking the harpist should wear white.
竖琴师？我朋友玛洁莉 不是要打钢鼓？012---Harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
- 她退出了 - 真的？为什么？012---- Oh, she backed out. - She did? Why?
我逼她的012---I made her.
钢鼓并不适合典雅的婚礼012---Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding."
- 还有玛洁莉浓郁的体味 - 听好012---- Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent. - Hey!
等西藏独立后，她自然会洗澡012---She will shower when Tibet is free.
- 嘿，你看起来真美 - 你也不错012---CHANDLER: Hey. You look great. PHOEBE: You too.
很高兴能来晚餐彩排 很少有机会用赛前先试吃012---I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner. I rarely practice my meals before I eat.
你忘记你要送我们的礼物了吗？012---What did we say was your one gift to us?
不说冷笑话 可是不是要等正式婚礼再说？012---No stupid jokes, but I thought that was for the actual wedding.
先彩排012---Rehearse it.
你好012---Hi.
- 谢谢你们来 - 对…012---- Thanks for coming, you guys. - Oh, yeah...
我本来…要跟你握手的012---I was... I was going for a handshake.
所以你的手抵住我的胯下？012---That why your hand's against my crotch?
- 没错 - 好012---- That is why. MIKE: Yeah.
瑞秋，艾玛在哪？012---So, Rach, where's Emma?
摩妮卡逼我把她托我妈带012---Monica made me send her to my mom's.
因为小婴儿不适合参加婚礼012---Apparently, babies and weddings don't mix.
你还在为那死小鬼抱怨吗？012---Are you still crying about your damn baby?
菲比，你要让队伍继续动 切记，一人二十秒012---Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving. Remember, 20 seconds per person.
这些小丑，你每天都见得到012---You see these clowns all the time.
- 你们是麦克的父母，对吧？ - 是的012---- Hey, you're Mike's parents, right? - Yes, we are.
孩子们长得真快，不是吗？012---Gosh, our little ones are growing up fast, aren't they?
- 什么意思？ - 你知道的…012---- How's that? - You know...
虽然很替他们高兴 但要放手却也很难012---...on one hand, you're happy for them. On the other, it's hard to let go.
你到底是谁？012---Who in God's name are you?
我也不是很喜欢你，老兄 我是看在孩子的份上给你面子012---I'm not that fond of you either, buddy. I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.
对了，我们还不知道 明天在婚礼中要负责的工作012---You know what? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
我们应该要当伴郎的 怎么还不跟我们说？012---I thought we'd be groomsmen. They would have asked us by now.
他们什么时候请你当伴娘的？012---When did they ask you to be a bridesmaid?
- 11月 - 看来情况不妙012---- November. - I wanna say it's not looking good.
- 菲比？ - 怎么了？012---- Hey, Pheebs? - Huh?
你还没分配他们在婚礼的工作012---You haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
这个…他们不必参与婚礼的工作012---Um, well, they're not in the wedding.
什么？012---What?
那么…012---Well...
好尴尬012---...this is really awkward.
对了，我可以离开012---Oh, and I can leave.
抱歉，两位，麦克有哥哥和同学012---I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got his brother and his friends from school.
所以你们…012---So, you know, you were...
其实，你们是备取 差一点就当成了012---If it helps, you were next in line. You just missed the cut.
天啊012---Oh, man.
这像是花式溜冰队的噩梦又重演了012---This is like figure skating team all over again.
我是说水上芭蕾012---I mean, synchronized swimming.
我是说…平衡木012---I mean... I mean, the balance beam.
- 救救我 - 美式足球012---- Help me. - Football.
威谢你012---Thank you.
菲比，快吐出来，里面有猪肉012---Oh, Pheebs, spit that out. That has pork in it.
哦！哦！012---Oh! Oh!
我以为锅贴不是素食的吗？012---I thought the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian?
对，我换掉了，我有传真通知你012---Yeah, I changed them. I sent you a fax about it.
我没有传真机012---I don't have a fax machine.
那么接下来会有更多惊喜012---Huh. Well, then there are gonna be a few surprises.
想不到我们是唯一 无法参与婚礼工作的人012---I can't believe we're gonna be the only people not in the wedding.
- 我了解，我讨厌遭到冷落 - 更何况是婚礼012---- I know. I hate being left out of things. - And it's a wedding.
我没份才真是诡异012---It'll be weird if I'm not in it.
- 各位，你们好吗？ - 很好012---- Hey, guys, how's it going? - Fine.
我们闲着没事坐在这儿 为明天要做的事彩排012---We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
听着，关于明天我有件事要问你们012---Look, about tomorrow, I've got a question for you.
我刚发现 其中一个伴郎有急事不能来012---I found out one of my groomsmen had an emergency and can't make it.
- 出了什么事？ - 谁管他？然后呢？012---- What happened? - Who cares? And?
我在想也许你们其中一个人…012---And I was wondering if one of you guys...
- 我来 - 我要012---- I'll do it! - Me!
你们都想当？可是只有一个空缺012---You both wanna do it? There's only room for one.
选我，我穿礼服很师 但不会抢走你们的风采012---Pick me. I look great in a tux, and I won't steal focus.
不…麦克，应该选我，你瞧012---No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me. I mean... Watch.
啊哈？012---Huh?
我觉得由我决定不太妥当012---You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision.
菲比跟你们比较熟，我请她选好了012---You know, Phoebe knows you better. I'm gonna let her choose.
如果让菲比选 那就见过麦克的新伴郎吧012---Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
当然，可是我需要镜子…012---Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...
因为就是在下012---...as he is me.
- 得了吧，你死定了 - 你才死透了012---- Please. You're going down. - You are going "downer."
花式溜冰队的人都这么说话吗？012---They say that on the figure skating team?
我不知道，我根本没入选012---I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.
你知道我明天要 代替菲比的继父吧？012---You know I'm filling in for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?
- 对，感谢你的帮忙 - 我乐意之至012---- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that. - Oh, hey, my pleasure.
你对我的菲比有何意图？012---So, what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
- 我意图娶她为妻 - 耍嘴皮子012---- I intend to marry her. - Oh, a wiseacre.
我还听说你打算以弹钢琴维持家计？012---I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano?
这样收入不会不稳定吗？012---Isn't that kind of unstable?
- 应该比演戏好 - 两好球012---- No more so than acting. - Strike two.
你说得对，可能要她养我012---You're right. She probably will support me.
不如搬去和你住吧？爸012---Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.
三好球012---Strike three.
你只剩一次机会，麦克012---You only get one more, Mike.
你决定如何？012---So? What did you decide?
我决定去上厕所012---I decided to pee.
麦克没跟你说吗？你得从我们之中 选出一个人参加婚礼012---You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding.
- 有- 个伴郎不能来 - 不行…012---- One of the groomsmen fell out. - Oh, no, no.
我不能从你们俩选择，我爱你们俩012---I can't choose between you two. I love you both so much.
所以我们原本才不能参与婚礼012---Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
可是我不想选，这…012---But I don't wanna choose. It's...
- 等等，瑞秋？ - 什么？012---- Okay, wait. Rach? - Yeah?
听着，我有个伴娘的特殊任务 要交给你012---Listen, I have a very special bridesmaid task for you to do.
太好了，是什么？012---Goody! What is it?
现在有一个伴郎的空缺012---Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman...
你要从罗斯和钱德其中择一 祝你好运012---...and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
什么…？我不想选012---What? What, what, what? No, I don't wanna do that.
看来我得找新伴娘了012---I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
我来当012---I'll do it!
现在已经2 1 00了012---Okay, it's 2100 hours.
- 该敬酒了 - 我可以去上厕所吗？012---- Time for your toast. - Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
你在2030有上厕所时间 请遵守时问表，麦克012---You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike.
敬酒致词要简短012---In regards to the toasts, okay, you wanna keep them short.
冗长致词是晚餐彩排的一大杀手012---Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay.
只要进去办完正事就出来012---You just get in, do your thing, and get out.
你对钱德都这么说吗？012---Is that what you say to Chandler?
已经2 1 01了，我并不高兴012---It's 2101, and I am not amused.
好的012---Okay.
新郎新娘有几句话要说012---The bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
各位，大家好012---Okay. Hello, everyone.
威谢各位今晚的到来 明天就是大喜之日了012---And thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event.
有些人也许不知道麦克和我 一开始并没有看对眼012---Some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.
对，我朋友乔伊和我…012---Yeah. My friend Joey and I...
本来想替对方介绍对象，所以我…012---...decided to fix each other up with friends. So I...
好吧，我…012---Oh, okay. I...
所以我把他介绍给我朋友玛莉艾伦012---I thought about it, and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen...
她今晚不克前来，因为…其实…012---...who couldn't be here tonight, because... It's not...
其实不重要，她人在戒毒中心012---It's not important. Well, she's in rehab.
总之，乔伊说要把他朋友 麦克介绍给我012---Anyway. So Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike...
可是他没有叫麦克的朋友 所以借用我的麦克012---...only he didn't have a friend Mike, so he just brought my Mike. And... And...
然后…012---[CLEARS THROAT]
但结果…却是好的012---But despite, you know... It got good.
我想趁此机会谈我无法到来的母亲012---I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here.
天啊012---Oh, God.
机会没了012---And... And moment's over.
好…这个跳过012---So okay... Oh, no, forget that.
这也跳过…这梱好笑012---I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.
可是要先说这个才听得懂012---Oh, but you need to know that to get that.
那么…好…012---So... Oh, well, okay.
我…好…012---I... Okay.
摩妮卡，我受不了了！012---Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!
这是我的婚礼好吗？我不要这个…012---This is my wedding, okay? I don't want this...
或是这掴…还有这个…012---Or this... Or this...
可以吗？我只要一个简单的婚礼012---Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...
而且我的未婚夫 随时想上厕所都可以！012---...where my fiancé can go to the bathroom any time he wants!
- 算了，我不要你了 - 什么？012---- You know what? You're done. - What?
你被炒鱿′鱼了！012---You're fired!
干杯012---Cheers.
- 嘿 - 大喜之日快乐012---- Hey. - Happy wedding day.
祝你我的大喜之日快乐012---Happy my wedding day to you.
乔伊，这里要当伴娘休息室012---Joey, listen, this is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right?
所以厕所袒会有人梳发，上化妆品012---We're gonna have hair and makeup in the bathroom.
我空出冰箱一些空间放胸花012---I had to move a couple things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
可恶，早知道有胸花吃 我就不吃早赛了012---Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was gonna be corsages.
嗨012---Hi.
关于昨晚…012---About last night...
我知道你压力很大…012---I know you're under a lot of stress, and...
虽然你的话有点伤人…012---Well, even though the things you said hurt me a little bit...
我的重点是…012---My point is...
我希望你让我继续工作012---Well, I'm willing to take my job back.
没关系012---Oh, well, that's okay.
我觉得你只当伴娘 你我会处得比较好012---I think you and I will do much better if you're just here as a bridesmaid.
是这样吗？012---Oh, is that so?
好吧012---Okay.
既然如此，拿去012---If that's really what you want, then here.
耳机给你，但是我不想给你耳机012---I give you the headset. I don't really wanna give you the headset.
既然你要自己处理 那就要回覆这些留言012---I guess if you're taking over, then you should probably return these messages.
这么多012---- This is a lot. - Uh-huh.
我相信你可以应付 虽然我的组织能力012---But I'm sure you can handle this. I have won awards...
曾经得过奖，但我相信你应付得来012---...for my organizational skills. But I'm sure you'll do fine.
- 你得过奖？ - 我全都用电脑列印出来012---- You've won awards? - I printed them out on my computer.
- 嘿 - 嗨012---- Hey. - Hi.
- 瑞秋在哪？ - 房问里，怎么了？012---- Where's Rach? - She's in her room. Why?
我要跟她谈伴郎的事012---I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation.
我不要像呆瓜一样坐在那看着钱德012---I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm in the seats like some chump.
老天啊，你真是明艳动人012---My God, you're breathtaking.
你想干嘛？012---What do you want?
你不会已经选出伴郎人选了吧？012---You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
罗斯，不要再给我压力了012---Ross, please don't make this harder than it already is.
我不会，我让你轻松点，选我就好012---I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.
钱德也说这对他意义重大012---- Chandler said it's important to him too. - Listen. Listen.
听我说…012---Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you.
我保证不会说话 可是如果你选钱德012---Now, I promise I won't say a word. But if you pick Chandler...
他会不停在你耳边说冷笑话012---...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time.
两个烂苹果，你比较不烂012---Oh, you are the lesser of two evils.
太好了012---Yes!
史文，我听不懂你的话 你说花怎么了？012---Sven, I don't understand what you're saying. What is wrong with the flowers?
〝烂话〞？〝烂话〞到底是什么？012---"Lorkins"? What the hell are "lorkins"?
我知道012---I know.
- 你们好 - 麦克，如果你是瑞典人012---- Hey. - Mike, if you were Swedish...
然后你说〝烂话〞 那会是什么花？012---...and you were saying the word "lorkins," what flower would that be?
- 兰花？ - 没错012---- Orchids? - Right there!
难怪我要嫁给你012---That's why I'm marrying you.
你好，麦克012---Hello, Michael.
乔瑟夫012---Joseph.
借一步说话好吗？012---May I have a word with you, please?
这里真…012---This is...
不错012---...great.
请坐012---Have a seat.
昨晚…012---Last night...
我试着欢迎你加入我的家族012---...I tried to welcome you into my family.
反之，你却不尊重我012---And instead, you disrespect me.
此举我绝不允许012---I cannot allow this.
你在为一部烂黑帮电影彩排吗？012---Are you rehearsing for some really bad Mafia movie?
又给我回嘴012---More back talk.
没错，我的确引用最近 失败的试镜台词012---And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition...
《家族荣耀2：打开天窗说亮话》012---...for Family Honor 2: This A-Time It's A-Personal.
乔伊，我今天有点忙 你到底要说什么？012---Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today. What do you want?
我要你认真看待此事012---I want you to take this seriously!
菲比对我而官非常重要012---Phoebe is very, very important to me, okay?
我要确定你能照顾她012---I wanna make sure you are gonna take care of her.
乔伊，我爱菲比012---Joe, I love Phoebe.
她是我一生最重要的人012---She's the most important thing in my life.
我死也不会让她受伤害012---I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
这才是我想听的012---That's what I wanted to hear.
因为她是我的家人012---Because she's family, okay?
现在你也即将加入我们012---And now you're gonna be family.
世界上最重要的莫过于家人012---And there's nothing more important in the whole world than family.
这部电影一定很糟012---That must have been one lousy movie.
这是我说的012---That was me!
- 嗨 - 嘿，我可以跟你谈伴郎的事吗？012---- Hi. - Let's talk about this groomsman thing.
你选罗斯的话 他会安然陪你走完走道012---If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the aisle just fine.
可是你选我的话012---But if you choose me...
你就有笑话听了012---...you'll be getting some comedy.
虽然如此…012---Even so...
我想我会选罗斯012---...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
好吧012---Okay.
我小时候，总是受冷落012---See, when I was a kid, you know, I was always left out of everything...
这让我很没有安全感012---...and it really made me feel insecure.
体育课总是没人要我012---I was always picked last in gym...
连那个不懂棒球规则的 胖交换学生都有人要012---...even behind that fat exchange student who didn't know the rules to baseball.
那家伙被三振出局还往三垒跑012---I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third.
总之，如果我是唯一 无法参与婚礼的人012---Anyway, if I'm the only one left out of this wedding...
那些不好的回忆一定又会涌上心头012---...I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
好吧，我选你012---All right, fine, I pick you.
好极了012---Yes!
伴郎钱德来也012---Make "groom" for Chandler.
天啊012---Oh, my.
不，照我的方式做 因为你的方式很蠢012---No, we're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid.
好吧，我得挂了 我还有电话，牧师012---All right, I got to go. I have another call, Reverend.
喂？012---Hello?
- 很高兴我们谈开了 - 没错012---- I'm glad we had this little talk. - Yes.
谢谢你给我新婚之夜的指点012---And thanks for all the wedding night advice.
我听完成到很自在012---That didn't make me uncomfortable at all.
好吧，各位今晚见了012---All right, so I'll see everybody tonight.
- 好 - 再见012---- Okay. - Bye.
你们知道走廊上有座大冰雕吗？012---Did you guys know that there's a giant ice sculpture in the hall?

好吧  也许我们应该拆散了试试012---Okay, maybe if we just break it down.
好吧  我们试试一次一个音节012---Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time.
好的  跟我念012---Okay, so repeat after me.
很好  快一点012---Great! Okay, faster.
好吧  这太难了  我教不了你012---Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
你干吗012---What are you doing?
我得走了012---I have to go
不然我要拿你的头撞墙了012---before I put your head through a wall.
不  别走  我需要你012---Don't go, I need you!
我明天就要试镜了012---My audition is tomorrow!
嘿  我本来想做晚饭的012---Hey. I was gonna make us some dinner...
但是你爸的冰箱里012---...but all I found in your dad's fridge
只有培根和奶油012---was bacon and heavy cream.
我想我们找到012---I think we solved
他得心脏病的原因了012---the mystery of the heart attack.
你给你父母打电话了吗012---Did you call your parents?
哦  打过了  艾玛很好012---Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
哦  好012---Oh, good.
-怎么  -只是不敢相信012---- What? - I just can't believe...
我在瑞秋·格林的房间里012---...I'm in Rachel Green's room.
你什么意思012---What do you mean?
你以前到过我的房间012---You've been in my room before.
可不是012---Yeah, sure, right.
就跟我真来过瑞秋·格林房间似的012---Like I'd ever be in Rachel Green's room.
好吧  我得跟你说012---Okay, I gotta tell you,
你叫我的全名可真有点儿怪012---it's really weird when you use my whole name.
对不起012---Sorry.
-你还好吧  -还行012---- You okay? - Yeah.
-今天太累了  是吧  -是啊012---- Yeah, you had a rough day. - Yeah.
看到他那个样子很奇怪  你知道吗012---It's just so weird seeing him like that, you know?
我是说  他是个医生012---I mean, he's a doctor.
医生怎么会得病的呢012---You don't expect doctors to get sick.
但我们确实会得病012---But we do.
他会好的  瑞秋012---He's gonna be okay, Rach.
我不想让他醒来一个人012---I don't want him to wake up alone.
我得去医院012---I should go to the hospital.
什么  不  等等  嘿  你看012---What? No, no. Hey, hey, look.
什么012---What?
他服了很多镇静药012---They gave him a lot of medication.
他甚至都不会知道你在不在那儿012---He wouldn't even know if you were there.
我们明天一早就去看他  好吗012---We'll go see him first thing in the morning. Ok?
真的  我不去也不用于心有愧012---Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
不用  天啊  嘿012---No-- God, hey.
瑞秋  你是个好女儿  知道吗012---Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, okay?
现在  你需要好好休息一下012---Right now you need to get some rest.
好吧  也许你说得对012---Okay, maybe you're right.
晚安012---Good night.
等等...012---Wait, wait, wait.
你能不能在这012---Would you stay here
陪我呆一会儿012---with me for a little while?
-当然  -好012---- Sure. - Okay.
谢谢你今天陪我来012---Thank you for coming with me today.
哦  应该的012---Oh, of course.
瑞秋·格林很高兴你在她房间里012---Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.
我也很高兴  来012---Me too. Come here.
我只是不想晚上一个人在这儿012---I just don't wanna be alone tonight.
那好012---Okay, well,
我可以找条睡袋什么的...012---I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or--
不行  瑞秋012---No, Rach!
抱歉012---I'm sorry,
我只是觉得这样不好012---I just don't think this is a good idea.
我们不做怎么知道好不好012---Well, we won't know that until we do it,
对吧012---will we?
不  你看  嗯…012---No, look, uh.
你为你父亲的事儿心烦012---You are upset about your father,
你现在很脆弱012---and you're feeling vulnerable...
而且我觉得这时候012---...and I just don't feel it
这么做不对012---would be right.
我会觉得012---I feel like I'd be, you know,
这是在占你便宜012---taking advantage of you.
什么 占便宜012---What--? Taking advantage?
我在主动投怀送抱  你尽兴好啦012---I am giving you the advantage. Enjoy!
我知道肯定会很美妙...012---Look, I'm sure it would be great...
但我认为我们俩得有一个保持清醒012---...but I think one of us has to be thinking clearly.
所以我要走了012---So I'm gonna go.
好吧012---Okay.
明天早上见012---I'll see you in the morning.
我都4个月没有做爱了012---I haven't had sex in four months.
我刚才的高姿态应该得块奖章012---I should get a medal for that!
谢谢你们带我去了那么多地方012---Thanks so much for taking me to all those places.
我玩得很高兴012---I had a great time.
哦  我也很高兴012---I'm glad.
但是  我得为钱德勒道歉012---Listen, I wanna apologize about Chandler, though.
我没想到他会这样012---I just did not see this coming.
纽约可真棒012---New York is awesome!
你怎么回事儿012---What is with you?
你知道吗  我以前去过那些地方012---You know, I've been to these places before...
但是我都没有好好看过风景012---...but I've never really seen them.
没错  你学牛叫的时候错过好多风景012---Yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.
非常感谢你们带我观光012---Thank you for showing me around.
哦  我们很高兴陪你去012---Oh, it was our pleasure.
我们也想跟你熟悉熟悉012---We're so much enjoying getting to know you.
呃  你们还有什么想了解的吗012---Well, if there's anything else you wanna know....
好吧012---Okay.
你不会介意我问几个012---Can we ask you some questions
有关孩子父亲的问题吧012---about the father?
哦  没关系012---Oh, sure. Yeah.
他是我高中的男朋友012---Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
足球队长  很可爱012---captain of the football team, really cute.
后来他得到奖学金  上了大学012---Got a scholarship and went to college.
那不错啊012---That's great.
是啊  差不多就是他了012---Yeah, it's almost definitely him.
那怎么说012---How's that, now?
也有可能是另外一个人012---Well, there's a chance it's another guy.
我是说  我只跟两个人好过012---I mean, I've only ever been with two guys...
但是时间上有些重叠012---...but they sort of overlapped.
那么  另一个人是干什么的012---So, what does the other guy do?
他也上大学了吗012---Does he go to college too?
不  他在蹲监狱012---No, he's in prison.
那他是被诬告的吧012---Was he falsely accused of something?
不012---No.
他用铁铲杀了他爸爸012---He killed his father with a shovel.
但是除此之外  他还是个不错的人012---Other than that, he's a great guy.
我猜他爸爸不这么想012---I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
-你醒着呢吗   -我当然还醒着012---- Are you awake? - Of course I'm awake.
从今往后我是睡不着啦012---Assume from now on that I'm always awake.
好啦  我们也不确定就一定是他012---All right, we don't know that it's him.
我是说  也可能是那个踢足球的012---I mean, it could be the football guy.
亲爱的  我们这对儿倒霉蛋012---Honey, it's us.
肯定是摊上那个铁铲杀手012---Of course it's the shovel killer.
好了  好了  就算是他012---Well, all right, let's say that it is him.
我们就不要这孩子了  不012---Would we not want the baby? No.
我们会对他另眼相待吗012---Would we treat him any differently?
我会一直提防着他的012---I'd keep an eye on him.
我们一定得查出哪一个是孩子的父亲012---We have to find out who the father is.
-怎么查  -我不知道012---- How? - I don't know.
这种事儿可以测出来的  对吧012---They have tests for these things, right?
是  不过我们也许反应过度了012---Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.
你说得当然轻巧012---Easy for you to say.
他杀的是他爸爸012---He's a father killer.
他没准儿很爱他老妈012---He probably loves his mommy.
他没准儿在挥铲子的胳膊上012---He's probably got a tattoo
刺着"妈妈"呢012---that says "Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.
"现在我们从一数到五"012---We'll now count from one to five.
-"说得真好"  -谢谢012---- Good job. - Thank you.
-嘿  -嘿  乔伊012---- Hey. - Hey, Joey.
听我说  昨天的事儿我觉得不太好012---Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday,
我想了很多012---and I thought about it a lot.
我想是我太没有耐心了012---No, I was too impatient.
所以  我们今天再试试012---So let's try it again.
哦不  不用了  我不用你帮忙了012---That's okay. I don't need your help.
我可以自学012---I worked on it myself,
而且我得说我学得还不错嘞012---and I gotta say I am pretty good.
真的  说几句给我听听012---Really, can I hear some of it?
当然可以012---Sure, sure.
好012---Okay.
怎么样012---See?
好吧  你说的不是...012---You, you're not--
你不是在...012---You're not-- You're--
我再次重申  你说的不是法语012---Again, you're not speaking French!
哦  我觉着我说的是法语012---Oh, well, I think I am.
而且我肯定能得到那个角色012---Yeah, and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
你怎么会这么想的012---How could you possibly think that?
至少012---For one thing.
磁带上的那家伙说012---The guy on the tape
我念得不错012---said I was doing a good job!
嗨  瑞秋  给我倒杯咖啡好吗012---Hey, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
当然可以012---Sure.
你一早上话不多012---You've been quiet all morning.
没事儿吧012---Is everything okay?
-你肯定没事  -当然012---- You sure you're all right? - Yep.
好012---Okay.
好吧  那我去买点早饭012---Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
有个意见供你参考012---FYI.
得  来啦012---There it is.
以后012---In the future...
如果有女孩子需要点不理智的安慰性的爱爱012---...when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex,
你就满足她好啦012---just do it.
等等  你是因为昨晚的事儿生我的气012---Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?
我只是想做对的事012---I was just trying to do the right thing.
真的012---Really?
对我来说012---It seems to me.
要是你做得对的话012---If you had done the right thing...
我就不会一早醒来012---...l wouldn't have woken up
感觉又愚蠢又尴尬012---feeling stupid and embarrassed.
我只会觉得舒适而满意012---I would've woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.
-呃...  -哦  得了吧012---- Well-- - Oh, stop that!
我不敢相信  你怎么...012---I can't believe this. What you...
我只是做了回好人012---I was just being a good guy.
我以尊重和同情之心待你012---I treated you with respect and understanding.
啊  那可真性感012---Oh, that is so hot.
嘿  我是在为你着想012---Hey, I was looking out for you.
哦  真的  罗斯012---Oh, really? Well, Ross,
你要知道  我不是个小丫头012---you know what? I am a big girl.
我不需要有人告诉我012---I don't need someone telling me
什么对我来说最好012---what is best for me.
虽说以前我也经常没过成性生活012---I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot of times before.
但这次是最糟糕的012---This is the worst ever!
哦  真的  真的012---Oh, really? Really?
这对我来说也好不到哪儿去012---Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
哦  你猜...012---Okay, you know--?
嘿  嘿  你猜怎么着012---Hey, hey, you know what?
为了以后少这种麻烦012---To avoid this little thing in the future...
咱们就干脆说定012---...let's just say you and me?
你我以后再也不上床了012---Never having sex again.
什么012---What?
对了  "性"这个字以后免谈012---That's right! Sex is off the table!
我再也不会跟你睡觉啦012---I am never having sex with you again!

吉米尼·比利·鲍勃012---...Jiminy Billy Bob.

她跟蹲监狱的家伙012---...because the things
做的事012---she did with that prison guy?

听到这个人在说012---when I heard this man speaking...
我们法国小镇雅诗兰黛的方言012---...the regional dialect of my French town of Estee Lauder.
你真的认为这个人在说法语012---You really think this man is speaking French?
干得不错  小家伙012---Good job, little buddy.
你的法语讲得很好012---That was some really good French.
但是我觉得还是012---But I think we're gonna go with

也许再重蹈覆辙确实不是个好主意012---Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
谢谢  我很高兴你也这么想012---Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
这也有点可惜012---It's a shame, though.

好吧  我想我毫无原因的012---Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes
眼睛干燥喉咙痛012---and a scratchy throat for no reason.
或许是因为012---Maybe it's because you hung your head

也许是012---Maybe.

我的天啊012---Oh, my God.

我们今天在路上碰到他012---We ran into him on the street today,
他说也许他有工作给她012---and he said he might have a job for her.
但我知道他只是想拉她上床012---But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
他想跟她上床又怎样012---So, what if he wants to sleep with her?
我是说她单身而且可爱012---I mean, she's single, and he's cute.
什么012---Excuse me?
哦  拜托012---Oh, please.
昨天在地铁上012---Yesterday, on the subway, you couldn't stop staring...
你不停地盯着一个大胸脯的女人看012---...at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.

我们就要做父母了012---We're about to be parents.

你不相信我012---You didn't believe me.
我告诉你一切都会有起色012---I told you everything was gonna work out.

郊区那所讨厌的房子012---a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.

不  要去法国的人别靠近我012---No! Get your France-going arms away from me!
你没事儿吧012---Are you okay with this?
实际上我感到伤心012---Well, it makes me feel sad, but--

知道了012---I see.
瑞秋去了另一个国家012---Rachel moving to another country?

我们又能怎么样012---But what are we gonna do?
她需要这份工作012---She really needs this job.
如果拉夫·劳伦公司请她回去012---Do you think if Ralph Lauren offered her her old job back,

《老友记》  第十季  第15集  艾丝特尔死了012---Friends S10E15 The One Where Estelle Dies
嘿  菲比012---Hey, Phoebe. Hey.
嘿012---Hi.
在我们打算买的那座房子旁边012---The house next door to the one
有一座房子也在出售012---that we're buying just went on the market.
我想去看看012---I wanna take a look at it,
可钱德勒不愿意012---but Chandler doesn't.
我们明天就签约了012---We close escrow tomorrow.
再看其它房子只会迷惑自己012---Seeing another house can only confuse us.
我们很容易感到迷惑012---We're easily confused.
我们并不机灵012---We're not very bright.
那如果它比我们的更好呢012---But what if it's better than ours?
至少应该看看012---Shouldn't we look?
你怎么看  菲比012---What do you think, Pheebs?
我觉得你穿这件衬衣012---Well, I think that shirt makes you look like
像雪糕餐厅的服务员012---you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.
信不信由你...012---Anyway....
乔伊的经理人是艾丝特尔·伦纳德吗012---Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
对.012---Yeah.
-她死了  -真的吗012---- She died. - You're kidding!
-真糟糕   -是的  在上个星期六012---- That's terrible. - Yeah, last Saturday.
哇  她是第一个独自驾机012---Wow! She was the first black man
飞越大西洋的黑人男性012---to fly solo across the Atlantic!
哦  等等  我看串行了012---Wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
哦012---Oh, yeah?
对  是那个经纪人012---Yeah, she was just an agent.
乔伊肯定感到很难过012---Joey's gonna be so upset.
是的  他一直希望成为012---I know. He always wanted to be
第一个独自驾机飞越大西洋的黑人男性012---the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
我们不能让乔伊知道这件事012---We cannot tell Joey about this.
一切都在改变012---He's already flipping out
他都快要发疯了012---about everything changing.
不能再刺激他了012---This'll push him over the edge.
你真的认为我们不应该告诉他吗012---You don't think we should tell him?
至少暂时不说012---Not for a while.
给他几天012---Let's just give him a few days
先消化已经发生了的事012---to get used to everything else.
如果他从报纸上看到呢012---What if he reads the paper?
除非是八卦的史努比告诉查理·布朗012---Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,
否则就没问题012---I think we're okay.
有什么事吗012---May I help you?
我是瑞秋·格林的朋友012---Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.
我们两年前在圣诞派对上见过面012---Actually, we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
-哦  是唐   -差不多  是罗恩012---- Oh, right. Don? - Close. Ron.
有什么能帮忙的吗012---Well, what can I do for you?
想了解一下012---Well, I'm here to see
能不能恢复瑞秋的工作012---if you'll give Rachel her job back.
是她让你来的吗012---Did she ask you to come here and do this?
不  如果你同意了012---First I have to get you to agree...
我还要问问她是否愿意回来012---...then we'll see if she wants to come back.
哇  这真吸引人012---Wow, that is tempting.
她很喜欢这份工作012---She loved her job here.
实际上  你找不到比她更好的人选012---Let's face it, you're not gonna find anyone...
是这样吗012---...who did it as well as she did. Isn't that true?
-是很不错   -我真没料到012---- She is good. - I took a shot there.
可是  很抱歉  我无能为力012---But I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
事实是  我不想出力012---Oh, that's not true. There's nothing I want to do.
好的012---I see.
非常谢谢012---Thanks very much.
-是你儿子吗   -对  他叫罗斯012---- Is this your son? - Yeah, his name is Ross.
怎么了012---What?
没什么  跟罗恩发音很接近嘛012---Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.
这小罗斯有可能对恐龙有兴趣吗012---Does little Ross like dinosaurs, by any chance?
是的  他老是说起  那又怎么样012---Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?
他是否愿意012---How would he like to
和我到自然历史博物馆012---come with me to the Museum of Natural History...
在其他人都离开之后012---...after everyone else has left,
就剩我们两个012---just the two of us...
他想摸哪里就摸哪里012---...and he can touch anything he wants?
我说的话  我自己也听到了  有歧义了012---I just heard it how you must have heard it, and that's not good.
让我再说一遍   我是古生物学家012---Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist.
你也可以在场  摸的只会是骨头...化石012---You'll be there with us, and the touching refers only to bones-- fossils!
你真的可以安排到吗012---You could really arrange that?
如果你能让瑞秋回来  那就这么定了012---You let Rachel come back and it's done.
我想  让瑞秋回来  不见得就是坏事012---I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
太好了  十分感谢012---Yes! Thank you! This is great! Thank you so much.
我保证  这是你的孩子会高兴死的012---I swear, your kid's gonna have the time of his life.
太好了  我对他挺担心的012---That's great. I worry about little Ross.
他老是捧着书本012---He's always reading,
收集石头  完全被恐龙给迷住了012---collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
他会正常的012---He'll be fine!
- 嘿  菲比  - 嘿012---- Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.
你怎么了012---Everything okay?
我在生我经纪人的气012---I'm just mad at my agent.
艾丝特尔  为什么012---Estelle? Why?
有一部电视电影 其中的角色很合适我演012---There's a part in this TV movie that I would be perfect for...
她没有推荐我去  她最好有个好的借口012---...and I didn't even get put up for it. She better have a good reason.
我想她有的012---I'm guessing she does.
我想听听  她老是这样012---Well, I wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
噢  等等  我要先走了012---No, wait, wait, wait! All right, I gotta go.
答应我  等一会再打给她012---Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.
为什么012---Well, okay. Why?
因为  朋友之间的诺言  从不需要有原因012---Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
我喜欢这句话012---I love that saying!
-嗨   -乔伊  我是艾丝特尔012---- Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.
我正想打电话给你  真古怪012---I was just gonna call you. That's weird.
这是巧合  但是可信012---It's a little coincidental, but believable.
我想你肯定想知道012---Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
我为什么没有安排你012---why I didn't get you...
为那部电视电影试镜012---...an audition for that TV movie.
是的  确实是的012---Yeah, actually I am.
我想我失职了012---I guess I dropped the ball there.
就这样012---That's it?
我最近老是失职012---You know, it seems like all you do lately is drop the ball.
不要这么和我说话012---Don't take that tone with me.
你以为自己是谁012---Who do you think you are?
阿兰·莱蒙012---Alan Lemon,
第一个独自驾机飞越大西洋的黑人男性012---the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
听我说  你是我的经纪人012---No, look, all I'm saying is you're my agent...
但是你没有为我争取到试镜机会012---...and you're not getting me any auditions
我受够了012---and I'm tired of it.
你这样说什么意思012---What are you saying?
我意思是  不能再这样了  艾丝特尔012---I'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore, okay, Estelle?
你被解雇了  再见012---You're fired. Goodbye.
噢  艾丝特尔这个星期真倒霉012---Man, tough week for Estelle.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hi. - Hi.
艾玛把这忘在我那了012---Emma left her stuffed T. Rex at my house.
没这她可睡不着哦012---You know she can't sleep without it.
嗯  她现在在睡觉呢012---Well, she's asleep now.
别再塞这玩意儿给她012---Stop forcing that thing on her.
好的012---Okay.
哦  你绝对不会相信今天发生的事012---You're not gonna believe what happened to me today!
拉夫·劳伦公司打电话请我回去012---Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!
-不会吧   -好奇怪啊012---- No! - I mean, it was the weirdest thing.
他们先是解雇我  然后又无缘无故重新聘用我012---They fire me and then out of nowhere, they just hire me back.
一定是没我就不行了012---I mean, that place must just be falling apart without me!
那么  你不去巴黎了吧012---So you're not going to Paris?
去呀  我还去012---No, I'm still going!
什么...012---What?
好吧  当路易威登公司发现012---Well, when the Louis Vuitton people found out...
拉夫·劳伦公司请我回去012---...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,
他们就提高了我的报酬012---they offered me more money!
罗斯  是不是太棒了012---Ross, isn't that great?
我们有意买下旁边的那座房子012---Hi. We're buying the house next door.
允许我们参观一下这里吗012---Could we just take a look around?
当然可以012---Sure,
我刚好带人来参观012---I'm showing it to someone else right now,
你们进来吧012---but please, look around.
我感到这是对我们房子的不忠012---I feel like we're cheating on our house.
如果不忠的话  我们不也应该012---If we cheat, shouldn't it
一些事情老房子不会做012---be with a hot, younger house...
一个会做的年轻漂亮的房子来不忠吗012---...that does stuff that our house won't do?
我们的比这里更棒012---Ours is so much better!
客厅更小012---This living room is smaller,
饭厅像个洞穴012---the dining room looks like a cave.
真受不了012---What a hole!
-你们觉得怎么样   -喜欢012---- So, what do you think? - Love it!
我们本来有一位买家012---We already have one offer.
楼上的女士是另一位012---I think the lady upstairs will make another one.
是我们将来的邻居  他们是什么样的012---They could be our neighbors. What are they like?
楼上这位女士很好012---The woman upstairs is nice.
她和丈夫有2个小孩012---She and her husband have two kids.
丈夫在华尔街工作  她是...012---He's on Wall Street, and she's a--
哦...天...啊...012---Oh... my... God!
没错012---Sure.
乔伊  你想和我去...012---Hey, Joey, you wanna come with me to--?
你怎么啦012---Are you okay?
我为解雇艾丝特尔的事难过012---Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.
她肯定伤心死了012---This has gotta be killing her.
她不会因此死的012---No, that wouldn't kill her.
冠状动脉栓塞有可能012---A coronary embolism might.
她心都碎了  我是她唯一的客户012---I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard. I was her only client.
那个会吃纸的家伙除外012---Except for this guy who eats paper.
我猜他吃的钱比挣得多012---And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.
我明白她不是优秀的经纪人012---Look, I know she's not a great agent,
但我们合作10年了012---but she did stick with me for 10 years.
我要给她打电话  重新雇佣她012---I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
不...  不要给她打电话012---No, no, no! Don't call her.
-你等她给你打电话   -为什么012---- You wait for her to call you. - Why?
耐心是通向理解的大道012---Because patience is the road to understanding.
那是得到快乐的关键012---Which is the key to a happy heart.
你真让人吃惊  我服了012---You blow me away.
答应我  你等她给你打电话012---All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
-我答应你   -好的012---- I promise. - Okay.
这意味着  从不需要有原因012---And that means never having to give a reason.
这世界真小呀012---What a small world!
我还没碰到过碧昂丝012---And yet I never run into Beyonce.
你们认识012---You two know each other?
我们是老交情了012---We go way back.
在莫妮卡认识他之前012---Before Monica made an honest man out of him...
钱德勒曾经是我的小甜甜012---...Chandler used to be my little love muffin.
这么说  你们也要想买下一座房子012---So are you guys thinking of getting this house too?
如果是要投标竞价的话012---Are we gonna have a bidding war?
我可要警告你了  我是流氓我怕谁012---I better warn you, I'm a toughie.
别...012---Don't...
别这样012---Don't do that.
其实我们打算买下隔壁那座房子012---No, actually, we are buying the house next door.
为什么012---Why?
我不知道为什么012---I don't know why.
那就这么定了   本来我还在犹豫012---Oh, that decides it, then! I was on the fence.
没想到我们会成为邻居012---But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?
那我就买下来了012---Now we have to get it!
艾伦  我们去定下价钱012---Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.
怎么会搞成这样012---This cannot be happening.
经纪人不是说还有 另外一对夫妇有意购买吗012---The realtor said another couple made an offer.
珍妮斯可能就买不成了012---Maybe the Janices won't get it!
另外的夫妇可能会买下012---Maybe the other couple will.
这绝不可能发生012---The only way that'll happen is
除非那是希特勒夫妇012---if the other couple are the Hitlers!
我们两座房子都买下来  怎么样012---Okay, okay! All right, what if we get both houses?
将这里作为家庭旅馆012---We can turn this one into a guesthouse!
真是好主意012---That's a great idea!
我不是想招讨厌012---By the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful...
但你从什么时候开始爱乱花钱了012---...but when did you start crapping money?
-好呀  那你来想办法  -好啊012---- You come up with an idea. - All right.
还有3个小时才签约012---We've still got three hours till escrow closes on our house.
我们现在取消还来得及012---We can still get out.
我们喜欢这座房子012---But we love our house.
你也同样喜欢住在她隔壁吗012---Will we love it so much with her next door?
她还会在这大声嚷嚷012---And she's gonna be louder out here too!
讨厌的"噢...天...啊..."012---Just the crickets and, "Oh... my... God!"
即使我们不买这座房子012---Okay. But if we don't get this house,
她还是会在我们面前出现012---she'll still show up wherever we go.
她住在这012---At least if she's here,
起码不会再吓我们一跳012---it eliminates the element of surprise.
你不会再听到那3个字012---Never again will you have to hear the three words...
连你的蛋蛋都被吓得缩进去012---...that make your balls jump back up inside your body!
我们得想想办法012---Well, we have to do something.
不能就让她住在隔壁012---We can't have her living next door.
嗯  这也会012---Oh, that does it too.
谁012---Who is it?
是我  罗恩012---It's me. Ron.
我知道瑞秋拒绝你了012---Look, I know Rachel turned you down...
不过我有一个法子能让她会来012---...but I think there's a way you might be able to get her to come back.
请你别见怪012---This may surprise you,
重新聘用已经解雇的员工  不是我主要的工作012---but rehiring fired employees is not my main job.
先听我说012---Just hear me out.
给她提高薪酬  你认为怎么样012---How would you feel about offering her a raise?
不好  罗恩012---Not good, Ron.
可能我会说服你012---Perhaps I can persuade you.
你希望送给你儿子012---What if you could give your son...
这么一只恐龙蛋复制品吗012---...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
哇  这很不错呀012---Wow! That's pretty cool.
这么说  我们成交了012---So? Do we have a deal?
-好的  你成功了  -太好了012---- Okay, you got it. - Yes! Yes!
这会让我很受欢迎012---This is gonna make me very popular.
相信我  女士都喜欢它012---Believe me, the ladies, they love it.
我指的是我儿子012---I meant with my son.
对  女士对它不感兴趣012---Good, because the ladies, not so much.
乔伊  我是阿尔·则布克  那个吃纸的人012---Joey, this is Al Zebooker, the guy who eats paper.

艾丝特尔012---Estelle?
我打电话是要告诉你012---Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you
我没有因为你解雇我而感到伤心012---that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
好的  真难以置信你会打电话给我012---Okay. I just-- I can't believe you're calling me.
我觉得我不应该贸然造访012---I didn't think I should just drop by.
不  不要来访012---No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!
总之  你做了你必须做的是  我没意见012---Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
能问你个问题吗012---Can I ask you something?
你那边怎么样012---What's it like there?
还凑合012---It's all right.
我要挂了  祝你好运012---Look, kiddo, I gotta go.
你会飞黄腾达的012---Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge!

我刚才打给西德了012---Well, I just talked to Sid.
我们要买下这座房子012---We are definitely putting in an offer on the house.
一定会成功的012---And I'll bet we get it!
希特勒夫妇肯定会很失望012---The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
我要先走了  帮我跟莫妮卡说再见012---All right, I gotta run. Tell Monica I say goodbye.
我们回头见  邻居012---I'll see you later, neighbor.
等等012---Wait!
我想告诉你  你住在这里我很开心012---I just want you to know that I'm so happy you're going to be here.
噢  我也是012---Oh, me too!
因为这样012---Because...
这样...012---...that way...

钱德勒  你在说什么啊012---Chandler, what are you talking about?
你现在住在隔壁  我们会每天在一起012---Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.
西德和莫妮卡根本不会察觉012---Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
我不知道该说什么012---I don't know what to say.
很显然  我们之间还有热情012---I mean, you know, obviously we have this heat between us.
很显然012---Obviously.
但我爱我的丈夫012---But I love my husband.
我也知道你爱你的妻子012---And I know you love your wife.
我现在认为我不应该买这座房子012---I don't think we should get this house now.
别这么说  别打破我们的美梦012---Don't say that. Don't dangle the dream and take it away.
钱德勒  我们其中必须有一个人立场要坚定012---Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
我知道012---I understand.
尽管012---Although....
最后就软弱一次吧012---Maybe just one last moment of weakness.
再见了  钱德勒·宾012---Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
不会再出现啦012---They're never coming down now!
-嘿  -嘿012---- Hi. - Hi!
嘿  你肯定不会相信今天的事012---You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
是什么012---What?
拉夫·劳伦公司又打电话来了012---Ralph Lauren called, again,
而且他们给我更高的报酬012---and they offered me more money.
- 真的吗   - 是的  真的太古怪了012---- They did? - Yes! It was the weirdest thing.
泽尔纳打给我  说愿意以任何代价请我回去012---Zelner called me and said, "We will do anything we can to get you back."
还说我应该为此感谢罗恩012---And that I should thank some "Ron."
可我连他是哪个部门的都不知道012---I don't even know what department that guy's in!
-那么  你决定要怎么做  -我接受了012---- So, what are you gonna do? - Well, I took it!

你高兴吗012---You're excited, right?
是的  报酬很优厚012---You know, the money's great.

我本来是盼望着去巴黎的吗  当然012---But, you know, I mean, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure.
为能在时尚之都工作而感到兴奋012---Was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?
哦  太棒了012---Oh, absolutely.
不过  这样也不错012---Yeah, but you know, this is....
重新回到原来的工作012---It's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much...
一个为之付出所有努力的工作012---...gotten everything out of it that I possibly can.
我不知道012---I had no idea--
我不知道你为巴黎如此着迷012---I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.
你说过你感到害怕012---I mean, you said you were scared.
我想这是良性的害怕012---I mean, it was "good" scared, though, you know?
当我搬来纽约时  我感到害怕012---I mean, like "when I moved to New York" scared.
当我发现怀上艾玛时  我感到害怕012---Or "when I found out I was gonna have Emma" scared.
这很不错啦  能行的012---But this is fine. This is gonna be good.
你应该去012---You should go.
什么012---What?
那是你希望做到的  去吧012---It's what you want. You should go.
你真的这么认为吗012---You really think so?
真的012---I really do.
可是我已经答应泽尔纳我会回去012---But I already told Zelner that I would come back.

需要的东西全都在这个包里012---Oh, well, everything that I need is in here...
而旅行要用到的证件都在台子上012---...and my travel documents are on the counter...
我已经把它们按照使用顺序排好了012---...organized in the order that I will be needing them.
天啊  我好像没什么要教你的了012---Oh, my God. I have nothing left to teach you.
你的护照呢012---Where's your passport?
应该跟我的机票下面012---It should be next to my plane ticket.
嗯...没有啊012---Well, it's not.
没有吗  也许我放在这里了012---What? Well, maybe I put it in here?
噢  没有  不在这儿...012---Oh, it's not in there!
哦不会吧012---Oh, no,
我肯定是把它封在这些箱子里了...012---I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
-我来帮你   -倒霉...012---- Here, let me help you. - Shoot.

从什么时间点开始012---At what point did
我把她的护照藏起来不好笑了012---it stop being funny that I took her passport?

-嘿  -嗨012---- Hey! - Hey.
嘿  艾瑞卡  欢迎回来012---Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.

这是因为我怀孕了012---That's because I'm pregnant.
-哦  对  没错  我知道   -哦  好吧012---- Right. No, I understand. - Oh, okay.
我就是怕012---I'm just always afraid

我想让她先见见医生012---And I wanted her to get to know the doctors
然后在酒店安顿下来012---and get settled into the hotel.

是一个有帮助的好哥哥呢012---Helpful brother.
还是一个去看青春片的老衰人012---Creepy loner at teen movie.

-知道了  -好吧012---- You got it. - All right.

让我们把这个塞到他的裤裆里012---Let's put Styrofoam peanuts down his pants
然后踢他012---and kick him!
不  不  不  她说的对 我们得开始工作了012---No, guys, she's right. We should get to work.

嘿  手铐  还裹着皮毛  真有你们的012---Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.
不知道你们还来这一手儿...012---I didn't know you guys had it in you.
钱德勒你没有妹妹012---Chandler, you don't have a sister,
所以你大概不能体会我现在012---so you can't understand...
有多闹心012---...how much this bums me out.
我不知道莫妮卡还有这玩意儿012---I didn't know Monica had these.
也许这是她用在别的男人身上的012---Maybe she used them with another boyfriend.
也许是理查德呢012---Maybe Richard.
为什么她和理查德玩儿这个  却不跟我玩儿012---Why would she use them with Richard and not me?
我也有怪癖啊012---I can be kinky.
有一次我还光着身子给她跳舞来着012---I once did a naked dance

-嘿  -嗨  迈克呢012---- Hey. - Hey. Where's Mike?
他有一场演出...012---Oh, he has a gig.

像是个摇滚歌星的老婆了...012---to a rock star, you know?
我老公有场演出012---My husband has a gig.
在哪儿演出啊012---Yeah? Where is it?

我刚才怎么交待你们的012---What did I just say?
不  不  没事儿  我没事012---Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. I'm gonna be fine.
-过来  我给你弄点喝的  -好的012---- Come here, I'll make you a drink. - Okay.
天呐  我真不敢相信  她真的要走了012---Oh, man, I can't believe she's actually leaving.
让我怎么开得了口说再见啊012---How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
她对我来说这么重要...就好像012---I know, she's been such a big part of my life.
就好像《飞跃情海》被砍了一样012---It feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.
我是说..012---I mean....
不解释  我想念《飞跃情海》012---Forget it, I miss Melrose Place.
-我本来有机会阻止她的  -是吗012---- I had a chance to stop her too. - Yeah?
没想到猜钢崩儿我会连输57次012---Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row? You know?
正面她赢  反面我输012---Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.
等等...012---Wait a minute.
怎么了  乔伊012---Yes, Joe?
我忘了把衣服从干洗店拿回来了012---I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.
你还好吧012---So you doing okay?
嗯  我好多了012---Well, I've been better.
你们都会来看我的  对不对012---You guys are gonna come visit, right?
当然了012---Yes! You know,
再过6个月我的禁令就过期了012---in six months, the statute of limitations runs out...
到时候我又可以作国际旅行了012---...and I can travel internationally again.
-我一定会很想你的   -我也是012---- I'm gonna miss you so much. - I know.
你知道么012---You know what?
我对你们每个人都有些告别的话要说012---I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...
我本来打算在结束的时候说的012---...to each of you. I was gonna save it till the end of the night,
但是...跟我来012---but come here.
嘿  你们说她们到屋里去干吗012---Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
嗯  照我看来012---If I had to guess, I'd say...
肯定是瑞秋戴上塑料泡沫012---...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
然后菲比来动手打012---and Phoebe's doing the punching.
哦  菲比  我真不知道应该怎么开口012---Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
嗯  这样吧012---Okay, well, before you do,
我知道今天本来不需要给你准备礼物的012---I know we weren't supposed to get you presents...
但我还是准备了一个012---...but I do have something for you.
哦  哦  这是什么012---What is it?
是一个棉花棒012---Well, it's a cotton swab...
上面沾了些我的唾液012---...with a bit of my saliva on it...
这样一来 如果你在巴黎的时候012---...so that if they perfect the cloning process
发现那边的克隆技术成熟了012---while you're over there...
你就可以用这上面的DNA012---...you can use the DNA
来另外做一个菲比012---to create your own Pheebs.
我可能会把这个扔掉...012---I'm gonna throw this away...
但是我很感谢你这份心意...012---...but thank you so much for the gesture.
钱德勒012---Chandler?
我刚才在卧室的枕头上发现了这个012---I was just in our bedroom, and I found these on my pillow.
哦  我决定把这个先给你留着012---Oh, yes, I decided to leave those out for you
万一哪天理查德过来012---in case Richard stops by...
你可以跟他的胡子一起玩012---...and you want to engage in a little light bondage and mustache play.
你说什么呢  这不是我的012---What? These aren't mine.
啊  是吗012---Oh, yeah, right!
以后休想再让我给你跳领带舞了012---Good luck getting another scarf dance from me.
这种"惩罚"太可怕了012---That would be a terrible punishment.
我是说真的012---But I'm serious,
我以前从来没见过这东西012---I've never seen these before.
真的吗012---Really?
那它怎么会出现在我们的客房里的012---Then what are they doing in our guest room?
瑞秋曾经在那里住过012---Rachel used to live in that room.
瑞秋...  戴着手铐...012---Rachel. With handcuffs.
有意思012---Interesting.
光着屁股的乔伊012---Joey's bare ass.
真有你的012---Well played.
-我爱你  菲比  -我也爱你012---- I love you, Phoebe. - I love you too.
你..012---Please....
你可千万...012---Please don't--
别变成一个...法国婊子012---Don't turn into, you know, a French bitch.
好的012---I won't.
如果我想一个一个告别012---All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
我得继续找其他人了012---I better keep going.
-好的  -好的012---- Okay. - Okay.
-莫妮卡 -哦012---- Monica? - Yeah?
-跟我进来一下好吗  -当然012---- Will you come with me for a minute? - Sure.
-你的睫毛膏是防水的么   -不是啊012---- Are you wearing waterproof mascara? - No.
哦  你完蛋了012---Oh, you're so screwed.
嘿012---Hey.
这是怎么回事012---What was that all about?
她打算跟012---She's gonna say goodbye
我们每个人单独告别012---to each of us individually.
开什么玩笑  天呐012---Are you kidding? Oh, my God.
是啊  我知道012---Yeah, I know.
轮到你的时候可能会更糟012---It's gonna be even worse for you. God.
天呐  准备好好大哭一场吧012---Well, just get ready to do some serious crying.
天呐  我怕我会撑不过去012---Man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this.
我现在终于知道012---Now I know how my students feel
每个学期末我的学生们的感受了012---at the end of each year.
我猜他们是因为太舍不得我了012---And why they act out
所以才会在评定时给我打那么低的分数012---by giving me such bad evaluations.
莫妮卡  好吧012---Mon. Okay.
我就直说了  我想说的是...012---I better just say what it is I'm gonna say.
如果没有你012---None of the amazing things
我在过去十年里012---that have happened to me in the last 10 years...
我不可能会这么幸福012---...would have happened if it wasn't for you.
一直以来  你对我来说就像是姐妹一样012---No one has been more like a sister to me.
我知道你的意思012---I know what you mean.
我也一直把你当作姐妹012---You're like a sister to me too.
我不知道没有你我会怎么办012---I don't know what I'm going to do without you.
你是我做好的朋友012---You're the greatest friend I ever had.
...每天见到你012-----Seeing you every day.
你说什么012---What?
我...012---I--
每天都看见你012-----see you every day!
太让我感动了012---That is so sweet!
她已经搞掂莫妮卡了012---Oh, no, she took down Monica.
要知道在盖勒家我是最爱哭的012---And I'm the crier in the family.
天呐  可能该轮到我了012---Oh, God, I could be next.
如果我跟你说话012---Maybe she won't talk to me
她可能就不选我了012---if it looks like we're deep in conversation.
哦  那么说你之前说的那个什么012---Oh, so that thing you said about the thing...
让我想起了那个什么012---...it really made me think about that other thing.
瑞秋012---Rach?
好了  看起来钱德勒找上她了012---Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.
你想起了哪个什么啊012---I really made you think about that thing, huh?
瑞秋  我想这个应该是你的吧012---Rach, I think I have something that belongs to you.
你的笑话又来了  每次我都得逼着自己乐012---I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes
我将来一定会怀念这种感觉012---that I don't get.
不  不  这真的是你的012---No, no, they're really yours.
我们是在你住过的房间里找到的012---We found them in your old room.
但这不是我的啊012---These aren't mine.
也许这是莫妮卡以前和...012---Maybe Monica used to use them with--
别提理查德012---Don't say Richard.
如果这不是莫妮卡的012---Well, if they're not Monica's
也不是你的  那是谁的呢012---and they're not yours, then whose are they?
我想你大概忘了012---I think you're forgetting
在客房里住过的所有人里面  谁是最变态的012---the kinkiest former resident of that room.
-菲比  -嗯012---- Pheebs! - Yeah!
我想这个是你的吧012---I think these are yours.
这不是我的  稍微一使劲就坏了012---These are not mine. Look how flimsy they are. Come on.
如果你用这个把人栓在水管上面012---My God, you try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these...
一使劲就断掉了012---...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
-我能单独跟你谈谈么  -当然012---- Can I talk to you alone for a minute? - Sure.
你不会真的把人拷在水管上吧012---You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes do you?
你以为迈克现在在哪儿012---Where do you think Mike really is?
哦  亲爱的012---Oh, honey....
让我先说两句吧012---Let me just saying something
要不然待会儿一旦我觉得不自然012---because once we get into this...
我可能又该012---...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
开始开无聊的玩笑了012---and probably make some stupid joke.
我就是想说  我...我爱你012---I just want to say that l-- I love you.
还有就是  我会想你的012---And I'm gonna miss you.
你就这么走了  我真的很难过012---And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
你知道吗012---Oh, you know what?
其它的什么也不用说了012---Let's not say anything else.
我也爱你012---I love you.
别抱的这么紧012---Not so tight.
对不起  再给我一次机会012---I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
好吧012---Okay.
好吧012---Okay.
走吧  走吧  我控制不了自己012---I'm sorry. Just go. Just go. I can't. I can't.
看来你是下一个了  准备好了没有012---So I guess you're next. You ready?
还没有012---I don't think so.
显然你没有012---Oh, you're definitely not.
我几年都没有这么哭过了012---I haven't cried like that in years.
昨天晚上你还对着六点钟的新闻哭来着012---You cried yesterday at the 6:00 news.
那个老太太被人骗得好惨012---That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
天呐  没想到她居然把我排在最后012---God, I can't believe she saved me for last.
他们俩怎么还没说完012---Why are they taking so long?
我也不知道012---I don't know.
不过看起来乔伊好像没什么事儿一样  真是意外012---But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.
-不  -不  乔伊012---- No! - No! Joey!
好了  轮到我了012---Okay, here we go.
-啊  好吧  -嗯012---- Well.... - Yeah.
我想我该走了012---I think I'm gonna take off.
哦大伙  真是奇妙的夜晚啊012---Oh, you guys, this was an amazing night.
非常感谢012---Thank you so much.
我爱你们012---I love you.
晚安012---Good night.
什么012---What?!
都不和我说再见的012---I don't get a goodbye?
你这个幸运的混蛋012---Lucky bastard.
我简直不敢相信012---Unbelievable.
她跟你们每个人告别  却不跟我说012---She says goodbye to everyone but me!
也许她觉得你们这么多年的默契012---Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history,
一切都...012---it could be...
"尽在不言中"了呢012---...you know, implicit.
那需要"言"的012---Well, it needs to be "plicit."
我们好好想想012---All right, let's think about this.
肯定是有什么原因的012---I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.
你是不是惹她生气了012---Did you do anything to make her mad?
没有啊012---No, I don't think so.
你知道  也许她和我们讲话花费不少体力012---You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.
-真是非常的热烈啊  -对啊  我的也是012---- It was pretty intense. - Yeah, mine too.
-我的也很猛烈  -好吧012---- Mine was a humdinger. - Okay!
我是说  我真的那么无足轻重吗012---I mean, don't I deserve anything?
哪怕是几滴眼泪  一个简单的拥抱012---I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?
不是跟你抱012---Not from you!
罗斯  如果你这么在意012---Ross, if you're this upset,
你应该去跟她直说012---you should go and talk to her.
说什么啊  说"你还没跟我告别呢"012---And say what? You owe me a goodbye?
他的自尊心往哪儿放012---I mean, he's got more pride than that.
什么自尊心  见鬼去吧012---The hell I do!
-连再见都不跟我说   -什么012---- I don't get a goodbye? - What?
你跟其他人都告过别了  为什么没有我012---Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
到底要我做什么你才舍得跟我说句再见012---What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?
做你最好的朋友  和你约会012---Be best friends with you? Go out with you?
跟你生个孩子012---Have a baby with you?
哦  等一下  等一下012---Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
这些我好像都做过012---I did all those things!
罗斯...012---Ross--
哦  也许我应该012---Or maybe I'm just not giving you...
体谅你一下012---...enough credit.
也许连续跟五个人说再见是太困难了一点012---I mean, it is difficult to say goodbye to five people.
再见  再见  再见  再见  再...012---Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, g--
生理上是做不到的012---It's physically impossible!
你知道么012---You know what?
经历了这多多年的一切012---After all we've been through...
我真没想到012---...l can't believe this is
这就是你想要的结局012---how you want to leave things between us.
祝你在巴黎一切顺利012---Have a good time in Paris.
我希望罗斯不会太沮丧012---I hope Ross isn't too upset.
我肯定012---I'm sure he's not more bummed out...
-我比他难过  -谁说不是呢012---- ...than I am. - Tell me about it.
你不能说012---Well, you can't say
我们不会组织派对012---we don't know how to throw a party.
我要撤了012---I think I'm gonna head out.
你打算去哪儿012---Where do you think you're going?
我打算回家睡觉012---I thought I was going home to bed...
不过现在我感觉到012---...but I'm sensing
有人要逼我留下来了012---there's something less fun for me to do here.
我们马上就要搬家了012---We're moving in a couple of days,
有很多东西需要收拾012---and we got a lot of packing to do.
如果你们能来帮忙就太好了012---It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
乔伊和我可以继续收拾客房012---Joey and I can finish up the guest room.
是啊  是啊  好主意012---Yeah, good idea.
噢  不行   你和菲比留在这儿帮我012---Oh, no. You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
你就不会装得冷静一点012---You couldn't be cool.
好的  让我们从厨房开始012---We're gonna start in the kitchen.
首先盘子放在盘套里012---Plates get put into plate protectors
然后十个一组装箱012---and stacked 10 to a box.
银器要先用橡胶膜捆上012---The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands
然后用塑料泡沫包上  明白了没有012---and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
明白了012---Yeah.
好  你们要小心一点012---Good. I need you to be careful...
同时动作要快  记住  如果我朝你们叫唤012---...and efficient. And remember, if I'm harsh with you...
那肯定是你们哪里做错了012---...it is only because you're doing it wrong.
嘿  莫妮卡  我想我知道手铐是谁的了012---Hey, Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
你怎么知道的012---You did? How?
我刚才在收拾柜子的时候012---Well, I was cleaning out the closet...
发现了一些012---...and I found some pictures of them...
-与之相关的照片  -天呐  让我看看012---- ...being used. - Oh, my God, let me see.
这下流的老女人是谁012---Who's that dirty old lady?
莫妮卡的祖母012---Monica's grandmother.
奶奶喜欢狂野哦012---Nana liked it rough!
-嗨  -嘿012---- Hi. - Hey.
-来  坐下  坐下   -对012---- Oh, here, have a seat. - Yeah.
-今天晚上过得怎么样  -还不错.012---- How was your night? - Oh, it was okay.
我和我堂兄去看了场电影012---I went to a movie with my cousin
然后一起吃了晚饭012---then out for dinner.
我们去的餐厅...012---We went to this place that had--
总之呢  那家餐厅的起司汉堡真是棒极了012---Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
艾瑞卡  你是不是不舒服012---Erica, are you okay?
有一点  可能是我吃多了012---Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
我的胃一直有点疼012---I keep getting these stomachaches.
每隔几分钟就疼一下012---They come and go every few minutes.
天呐012---Oh, my God.
别紧张  我们给她点胃药就行了012---Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.
那不是胃痛  那是阵痛的症状012---She doesn't have a stomachache! She's in labor!
哦天哪012---Oh, my God!
要赶快送她去医院012---Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!
钱德勒去拿外套  艾瑞卡我们马上出发012---Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
菲比和乔伊  继续收拾012---Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!
天呐  我们要有孩子了012---Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.
我们要有孩子了012---We're gonna have a baby!
天呐  我们要有孩子了012---Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby!
天呐  我得坐一下012---Oh, God, I've gotta sit down!
我得坐一下012---I've gotta sit down!
亲爱的  一切都会很顺利的012---Honey, it's gonna be okay.
你一定能撑过去的  深呼吸012---You can do this. Just breathe.
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
我觉得好一点了012---Okay, I feel a little better.
你确定吗012---Are you sure?
是的  我没事  亲爱的  我们走吧012---Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
好012---Okay.
大伙儿再见了012---Okay, bye, everyone!
-我们就要有孩子了 -好运012---- We're having a baby! - Good luck!
-钱德勒  等等  等等  -干吗012---- Chandler, wait, wait, wait! - What?
如果她有空的话012---If you get a second,
帮我问问她的那个起司汉堡是在哪吃的012---find out where she got that cheeseburger.
你真的以为我不跟你告别012---You think I didn't say goodbye to you
是因为我不在乎你012---because I don't care?
看起来就是这样啊012---That's what it seemed like.
我真不敢相信012---I cannot believe that after 10 years
都十年了 你居然对我连最起码的了解都没有012---you do not know one thing about me!
那你倒说说  你为什么不跟我告别呢012---Then why didn't you say something?
因为...那对我来说太困难了  罗斯012---Because it is too damn hard, Ross!
一想到我会那么挂念你012---I can't even begin to explain to you
我根本就开不了口012---how much I am gonna miss you.
每当我想到自己不能再天天看到你012---When I think about not seeing you every day,
我就不想走了012---it makes me not want to go.
如果你以为012---Okay? So if you think that
我不跟你告别是因为012---I didn't say goodbye to you...
你对我来说不如012---...because you don't mean as much to me
其他人那样重要  那么你错了012---as everybody else, you're wrong.
对我来说你比他们都重要012---It's because you mean more to me.
好了  现在明白了吧  这就是你要的告别012---So there, all right? There's your goodbye!
-瑞秋  -干吗012---- Rach! - What?
-你总...你不能...  -不能什么012---- You keep-- You can't-- - What?
-再多塞一点  -好012---- A little more. - Okay.
-再多一点  多一点  -好012---- A little more. A little more. - All right.
再...来一点012---Little more.
行了  来吧012---All right. All right, let's do this.
好  你准备好了么012---All right, ready?
好了  记住了要用全力012---Yep. Now give me your best shot.
行  来了012---All right. Here goes.
不管用012---Doesn't work.
《老友记》前情介绍：012---Previously on Friends:
艾瑞卡，你还好吧？012---Erica, are you okay?
还好，或许我吃太多了012---Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
一直有点胄痛，几分钟就痛一次012---I keep getting these stomachaches. They come and go, like, every few minutes.
-天啊  -别担心，给她点胃药就好了012----Oh, my God. -Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.
她不是胃痛，是要生了012---She doesn't have a stomachache! She's in labor!
天啊012---Oh, my God!
你认为我没跟你单独道别012---If you think that I didn't say goodbye...
是因为你没有其他人重要  你就错了012---...because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong.
是因为你太重要了012---It's because you mean more to me.
-瑞秋  -干嘛？012----Rach! -What?
嗨012---Hey.
接着睡吧  我该回家了012---Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
真是太棒了012---Oh, God. This was amazing.
的确是012---It really was.
你学了不少新招儿嘛012---You've learned some new moves.
同事给我本《笨人性指南》012---Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies"
想取笑我来着012---as a joke.
-现在看谁笑到最后了  -没错呵012---- Who's laughing now? - I am.

呼气...012---Breathe...
这样就对了012---Okay. Good.
下次我说"呼气"行吗012---Next time, can I say "breathe"?
不行  刚才你说得像吸血鬼一样012---No. Last time, you said it like Dracula,
吓死她了012---and it scared her.
还要点东西吗  冰片012---Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
没事  不用了012---No, I'm okay.
我马上就回来012---All right. I'll be right back.

-别把我们俩丢在一起啊 -说什么012---- You can't leave me alone with her. - What?
这就是那种社交场合012---This is exactly the kind of social situation...
我最怕的那种012---...that I am not comfortable with.
什么样的场合你不怕啊012---What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
我和她从来没单独待在一起过012---It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
没事的012---You'll be fine.
你不会  不过我马上就回来了012---You won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
好的012---Okay.
那个...夏天有什么打算012---So any plans for the summer?
不清楚  可能参加个教会野营吧012---I don't know. Maybe church camp.
那你去的时候  最好不要提起生孩子这件事012---May not want to mention this.
有没想过哪种情况更疼012---So you ever wonder which is worse?
产前阵痛和老二被踢012---You know, going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
-说什么   -就是想想挺有意思的012---- What? - Oh, it's just interesting.
谁也不会知道的012---Because no one will ever know
因为没人两种情况都能经历吧012---because no one can experience both.
世界上又一无法解答的难题012---One of life's great unanswerable questions.
谁知道  也许还有012---Who knows? Maybe there's something
比那两种情况更糟糕的呢012---even more painful than those things.
比如现在012---Like this.
-进  -早啊012---- Come in. - Morning.
-嗨   -这是什么啊012---- Hey. - What's that?
送莫妮卡和钱德勒的乔迁礼012---Oh, it's my housewarming present for Monica and Chandler.
刚出生的小鸡和小鸭012---That's a baby chick and duck.
我给它俩取名叫小小鸡和小小鸭012---And I named them Chick Jr. And Duck Jr.
真的是没想到哈012---I did not see that coming.
那么大个后院012---They'll love it at that new house.
它俩肯定会喜欢的012---It has that big backyard.
以后要是老了的话012---When they're old,
钱德勒可以和上次一样把它们送到012---they'll go to that farm...
上次那个特别农场去012---...that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
-没错  -是啊012---- Yes. - Yeah.
不过不能去看望实在是太不爽了012---It's a shame people can't visit there.
没办法  规矩就是这样012---That is the rule though.
好消息  你马上就当舅舅了012---Guess what. You're almost an uncle.
什么012---What?
艾瑞卡昨晚要生了012---Erica went into labor last night.
莫妮卡和钱德勒现在正在医院呢012---Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now.
-天呐   -我敢肯定是个女孩012---- Oh, my God! - I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.
你原来还猜本是个女孩来着呢012---Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
你看他扔过球吗012---Have you seen him throw a ball?
-瑞秋在不在  -还在睡觉吧012---- Is Rachel here? - I think she's still asleep.
昨晚你俩怎么样了012---How did it go with you guys last night?
她好像怒了012---She seemed pretty pissed at you.
后来事情解决了012---We worked things out.
笑啥呢012---What's that smile?
你俩是不是有事儿012---Did something happen with you two?
我这人办完事以后不喜欢到处宣传012---Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.
不过我也不会藏着不说012---But I'm also not one to have sex and shut up.
我俩做爱了012---We totally did it.
天呐  你和瑞秋012---Oh, my God. You and Rachel?
是啊  感觉太棒了012---I know, it's pretty great.
意味着什么啊012---So, what does that mean?
你们复合了012---Are you guys getting back together?
说不好012---Oh, I don't know.
我俩还没仔细谈过012---We didn't really get to talk.
但你自己想复合吗012---But do you want to get back together?
不清楚啊012---I don't know.
真的是难以置信012---It was incredible.
感觉太对了012---I mean, it just felt so right.
我把她抱在怀里时012---When I was holding her,
永远都不想让她离开012---I mean, I never wanted to let her go.
没错  我想和她在一起012---Know what? Yeah, I do. I want to be together.
那她还去巴黎吗012---So is she still going to Paris?
还没想过  希望不会吧012---Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
今天太伟大了  太伟大了012---This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
你俩要复合012---You guys might get back together.
莫妮卡和钱德勒要有小孩012---Monica and Chandler get their baby.
而且世界上012---There are chicks and ducks...
又有小鸡小鸭了012---...in the world again.
感觉就像在音乐剧中一样012---I feel like I'm in a musical.
早啊012---Morning.
你们永远也不知道结尾是什么了012---Guess you'll never know how it ends.
-嘿  -嗨012---- Hey. - Hi.
-睡得怎样  -很好很好  你呢012---- Hi. How'd you sleep? - Good. You?
-不错  -那还用说012---- Good. - I'll bet you did.
能让我俩单独待会儿吗012---Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
好  帮忙看着点小鸡和小鸭012---Sure. Just keep an eye on the chick and duck.
小鸡和小鸭  不是已经死...012---Chick and the duck? Didn't they die--?
死活非要去农场哦012---Dive. Yeah, they dove. Headfirst into fun on the farm.

我也是啊012---I know, me too. It was....
就像...012---You know, it was one of those things
有些事情觉得从来不可能012---you think is never going to happen.
但有一天真的发生了012---And then it does,
而且是自己所希望的那样012---and it's everything you want it to be.
我知道  实在是...012---I know. It was just....
实在是最好的告别方式了012---It's just the perfect way to say goodbye.
再使点劲  亲爱的012---Just a little bit more, honey.
疼死我了012---Oh, man, this hurts!

看看哪个更疼012---and see which is worse.
婴儿的头已经要出来了012---The baby's head is crowning.
天呐012---Oh, my God!
我所见过的最美丽的头顶了012---That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen.
-钱德勒 过来看   -我就不用了012---- Chandler, you have to see this. - I'm okay.

让你感觉任何女人都不如我爱你012---no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you.

我们只订了一个012---We only ordered one.
-你们知道是双胞胎吧   -才怪012---- You know it's twins, right? - Oh, yeah.
知道我们俩还能这副表情012---These are the faces of two people in the know.
怎么可能不知道是双胞胎012---I can't believe you didn't know it's twins.
以前从来没有过的012---This has never happened before.
这让我感觉又特殊又好啊012---Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
等等  你知道是双胞胎012---Wait. Did you know it was twins?

-有人告诉过你吗   -没有啊012---- Did anybody tell you? - I don't think so.
不过确实提到了两种心跳012---They did mention two heartbeats,
我当时觉得应该就是我和孩子的吧012---but l thought it was just mine and the baby's.
他们就一直说两个心跳都很强012---They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."
我就觉得不错啊 因为我正怀着孩子呢012---And I thought, "Well, that's good, because I'm having a baby."
太难以置信了012---This is unbelievable.
我家有生双胞胎的传统012---Twins actually run in my family.

给他俩一人半块信物012---We could give each of them half a medallion.
数年之后他们凭着信物重逢012---And then years later, they'll find each other...
大团圆012---...and be reunited.
到那时候大家该多开心啊012---I mean, that's a great day for everybody.

对012---Yeah.
现在一男一女了012---Well, now we have one of each.
然后就别再生了012---And that's enough.
后来她说那是最好的告别方式012---And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
天呐  你说什么了012---Oh, my God. What did you say?
什么都没说  能说什么啊012---Nothing. What do you say to that?

罗斯  瑞秋不知道你想复合012---Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you even wanna get back together.
如果她知道 想法可能就会变啊012---If she did, she might feel differently.
也许就不会走了012---She might not even go.
-你真的这么想   -没错的012---- You really think so? - I'm telling you!
好的  如果是音乐剧的话012---Oh, ok, this is the part of the musical
现在就应该是高潮了012---where there'd be a good, convincing song.
嗨012---Hi.
死活就不让我唱完了是吧012---Can't a girl finish a song around here?
-嘿  -刚把艾玛交给我妈了012---- Hey. - Hi. I dropped Emma off at my mom's.

-我太爱你们了  -我们也爱你012---- I love you all so much. - Love you.
-爱你  -到了打电话啊012---- We love you. - Call us when you get there.
一定  罗斯  过来012---I will. Ross, come here.
我想告诉你012---I just want you to know...
昨晚012---...last night...
我永远都不会忘记的012---...I'll never forget it.
我也不会012---Neither will l.
好吧  现在真的要走了012---All right. Now I really have to go.
再见012---Okay, au revoir.
到那他们一定会恨死我的012---They're gonna really hate me over there.
你就这么让她走了012---So you just let her go?
嗯012---Yeah.
-这样也许是最好的了 -是吗012---- Hey, maybe that's for the best. - Yeah?
是的  关于昨晚012---Yeah. You know, you just-- Look, you gotta--
她怎么想你也应该怎么想012---You gotta think about last night the way she does.
也许...也许上床012---Okay? You know, maybe....
就是最好的告别了012---Maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye.
可是这样一来她就不知道他的感受了啊012---Now she'll never know how he feels.
也许没关系的012---Maybe that's okay, you know?
也许这样更好012---Maybe it is better this way.
现在...现在你可以向前继续生活了012---I mean, now.... Now you can move on.
你已经努力适应这么久了012---I mean, you've been trying to for so long.
现在你们俩身在不同的大陆...012---Maybe now that you're on different continents....
是吧012---Right?
也许你现在终于可以解脱了012---Maybe now you can actually do it, you know.
终于可以不再想她了012---You can finally get over her.
的确是这样没错012---Yeah, that's true.
可是...012---Except....
我不愿意就这样解脱012---I don't want to get over her.
什么012---What?
我不想  我想和她在一起012---I don't. I want to be with her.
真的012---Really?
嗯  我去追她012---Yeah. I'm going to go after her.

不过我现在太兴奋了012---but I am excited!
罗斯  你觉得她会怎么说012---What do you think she's gonna say?
不知道012---I don't know.
不过即便她拒绝我012---Even if she shoots me down,
我也不会余生都活在猜测之中012---at least I won't spend my life wondering...
我外套哪儿去了012---...what would have happened. Where is my coat?
你根本就没穿来012---You didn't bring one!
我车就在下面012---My cab's downstairs.
开车送你去机场012---I'll drive you to the airport.
-大伙祝我好运   -快012---- Wish me luck. - Hurry!
祝你好运012---Good luck!
没安全带012---There's no seat belts!
没关系  一旦车撞到什么东西012---That's okay. If we hit anything...
马达就会爆炸012---...the engine will explode,
相比之下还是被甩出去比较好012---so it's better if you're thrown from the car.
-好  我们走   -好012---- All right, all right. Let's do this. - Okay!
-喂  -东区80号012---- Hey! - 80th and East End.
我不载客012---No. I don't take passengers.
法律规定逢客必载的012---The law makes you accept any fare.
你不明白  这车本来就不是计程车012---You don't understand. This cab isn't real.
等我去投诉你  你牌照号多少012---What's your medallion number?

自行车上的老太太还活着吗012---Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
活着  她及时跳开了012---Yeah, she jumped right back up.
天呐  菲比  开慢点012---Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
你到底想不想及时追上瑞秋012---Do you want to get to Rachel in time?
想  不过我不想死在你车里012---Yes, but I don't want to die in your cab.
上车之前你怎么不想清楚012---You should have thought of that before you got in!
-收费站  -什么012---- Tollbooth. - What?
收费站012---Tollbooth!
四块钱  杂物箱里有零钱012---Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
快点012---Hurry!
哦012---Okay.
妈的  窗户怎么这么干净012---Damn, that window's clean.
我们还说你拿礼物这么半天还不回来012---We were wondering what was taking so long...
现在才知道你在干这个012---...but now we understand. You were doing this.
我本想给你们个惊喜的012---Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but....
作为乔迁礼012---For your housewarming gift,
送给你们一只小鸡一只小鸭012---I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.

太好了012---Oh, great.
家里有婴儿012---Just what you want for
鸟粪真是锦上添花啊012---a new house with infants. Bird feces!
一定是从桌子上跳下去了012---But they must've jumped off the table.
现在都不见了啊012---Now they're gone!
别着急  慢慢找012---Don't worry, we'll find them.
我去看孩子去了012---Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
天呐  我刚才踩着什么了012---Oh, God! What did I just step on?
没事了  就是个蛋卷012---It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
你竟敢踩我的蛋卷012---You stepped on my egg roll?!
抱歉012---I'm sorry.
谁会想到地上会有中国菜012---I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
放到盘子里  然后快走012---Just put it on a plate and leave.
-好了  开始找吧  -好012---- Okay. Let's find these birds. - All right.
等等  听到了没012---Wait, wait. You hear that?
在桌子里012---They're in the table!
这可不妙了012---Well, that can't be good.
-必须要取出来  -怎么取012---- We gotta get them out of there! - How?
也许能引诱他们出来  你知道鸟怎么叫吗012---Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
当然了  我就是干伐木工的012---Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.
把桌子一头抬起来点也许管用012---Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
乔伊等一下  球012---Joey, wait! The ball!
现在怎么办012---So, what do we do?
不清楚  也许边上什么地方能打开吧012---Maybe we can open this up somehow.
好012---Okay.
不行啊  都粘上了012---No. It's all glued together.
也就是说要生撬开012---Does that mean we have to bust it open?
-不知道也许吧  -天呐012---- I don't know. Maybe. - Oh, my God.
我明白  这可是足球桌啊012---I know. It's-- It's the foosball table.
没有办法了012---All right, you know what? We don't have a choice.
就像我在一部科幻电影里面的台词一样012---It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie
如果我当初赢到角色的话012---if I'd have gotten the part.
"里面是我们的人  必须要救出来"012---Those are our men in there, and we have to get them out...
"即使要牺牲我生命中最重要的东西...012---...even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life...
我的时间机器"012---...my time machine.
-这电影拍出来了没   -根本也没拍012---- Did that movie ever get made? - It did not.
罗斯  你去哪里012---Ross, where are you going?
去找瑞秋啊012---To talk to Rachel.
所以我才坐死亡计程车来的012---Isn't that why we took a ride in the death cab?
你就直接去登机口012---You're walking up to her at the gate?
以前在没在机场追过人012---Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
我的警察戏镜头被取消之后就没有过了012---Not since my cop show got canceled.
必须先买票才能通过安检012---You have to get a ticket to get past security.
那就赶不及了啊012---What? We're never gonna make it.
这种态度肯定不行  快滚过来012---Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!
大家再走慢点012---Okay, if you could all walk slower,
就好了012---that'd be great.
-女士  看一下您的护照   -天呐012---- Madame, your passport, please. - Oh, my God.
我还害怕高中学的法语都忘干净了呢012---I was afraid I wouldn't remember my high school French.
你刚才说的每个字我都听明白了012---But I understood every word you just said.
-看一下您的登机牌  -哦  当然012---- Your boarding pass, please. - Oh, sure.

不过我清楚记得 我的座位号是32C012---but I remember that I was in seat 32C...
因为我罩杯号就是这个012---...because that's my bra size.
女士  您必须要有登机牌  否则……012---Madame. You must have your boarding pass--
好吧012---Ok, fine. But you know what?
我要是36D  就没这么多麻烦了012---If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
-您好  我要买一张票  -就买一张012---- Hi. I need a ticket. - Just one?
我开车这么大老远送你过来012---I drive you here,
不能看看结局啥样012---and I don't get to see how it works out?

我理解012---I understand.

桌子012---Table...

是啊  太难了012---Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.
我来吧  给我012---I'll do it. Give me.
菲比012---Phoebe!

纽瓦克  一个小时才能到012---Newark is, like, an hour away.
根本赶不上012---There's no way we'll make it in time.
她拿着手机呢  打电话012---She's got her cell. You could call her.
我不要在电话上谈012---I am not doing this over the phone.
你没其他办法了啊012---You don't have any other choice.
-喂  -瑞秋  太好了012---- Hello? - Rachel. Oh, good.
对了  你是不是刚上飞机012---By the way, did you just get on the plane?
-是啊 -不管怎样提一句   如果机场没去错012---- Yeah. - For what is worse, we would have caught her...
我们已经追上她了012---...if we were at the right airport.
-瑞  等着  -不不不012---- Rachel, hang on. - <i>No. No. No.
菲比  你那边不要紧吧012---Phoebe, is everything okay?

-啊  为什么  -我有种感觉012---- What? Why? - I have this feeling that...
飞机有问题012---...something's wrong with it.
左"弗兰基"有毛病012---Something is wrong with the left phalange.
亲爱的  飞机肯定没问题的012---Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
马上要起飞了012---Look, I have to go.
我爱你  一到巴黎就打电话012---I love you, and l will call you the minute I get to Paris.
你刚才说什么012---What was that?
哦  我的疯朋友012---Oh, that was just my crazy friend.
让我下飞机012---She told me to get off the plane
因为她就是感觉到012---because she had a "feeling" that there...
飞机左"弗兰基"有毛病012---...was something wrong with the left phalange.
听起来可不妙吧012---Okay. That doesn't sound good.
不用担心012---Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
她老是这样012---She comes up with this stuff,
而且几乎从没对过012---and she's almost never right.
也就是说她也有对的时候012---But she is sometimes.
啊012---Well....
你要干吗012---What are you doing?
这飞机我不能坐012---I can't take this plane now.
对不起先生  您去哪里012---Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?

她朋友感觉到012---Her friend has a feeling
飞机左"弗兰基"有毛病012---something's wrong with the left phalange.
请给我拿点花生好吗012---Could I get some peanuts?
飞机怎么了012---What's wrong with the plane?
飞机一点异常都没有012---There's nothing wrong.
左"弗兰基"有毛病了012---The left phalange.
根本就没有什么"弗兰基"012---There's no "phalange."
天呐  这破飞机连"弗兰基"都没有012---Oh, my God. This plane doesn't even have a phalange.
-我不飞了 -女士  请您坐好012---- I'm not flying on it. - Ma'am. Please sit down.
出什么事情了012---What's going on?
我们都下去  飞机上根本就没有"弗兰基"012---We're getting off. There is no phalange!
太荒谬了吧  我...012---This is ridiculous. I--
啊随便吧012---Yeah, okay.
好了  工作完成012---All right. My job here is done.
你太强了012---That was impressive.
大部分连工具都没用就弄下来了012---Yeah. You didn't even use the tools for most of it.
啊  工具太碍事了012---Yeah, they were just slowing me down.
好啦  我回去看孩子了012---All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
你们俩个丫头一会儿见012---See you girls later.
-真抱歉阿  桌子这样了  -嗯012---- Sorry about the table, man. - Yeah.
要买新的吗012---You gonna buy a new one?
也许不会了012---Probably not. No.
你走后我估计012---I don't know how much I'm gonna want to play
也不会怎么玩了012---after you go.
-至少这两个小家伙救出来了 -是啊012---- At least we got these little guys out. - Yeah.
我们还担心你们呢012---We were worried about you.
以后就多习惯有东西012---I guess I better get used to things
在我手里拉屎吧012---crapping in my hand, huh?
我会想你们的  小家伙012---I'm gonna miss these little guys.
再养养鸟还真挺不错的012---It was nice having birds around again.
这样吧012---Hey, you know what?
它们就交给你了012---Maybe we should keep them here with you.
什么012---What?
嗯  我们现在也忙得要死012---Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.
而且这里也有它们的房间啊012---And plus, here, they'd have their own room.
还可以再养只鹅012---I could get a goose!
我觉得家禽类这两只就够了012---You know, I think you're set with the poultry.
多谢了  听到没有012---Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?
你们要留在这里啦012---You're gonna get to stay here.
而且这样也挺好的012---And it's good...
因为012---...you know, because....
你就有理由012---Because now you have a reason
多回来看看了012---to come visit.
其实还有另外一个理由012---I think there may be another reason.
那么...012---So....
尴尬的拥抱呢  还是假酷男握手呢012---Awkward hug or lame cool-guy handshake?
啊  那好012---Yeah, well, you know,
还是假酷男握手吧012---lame cool-guy handshake.
女士  我想您保证  飞机没有问题012---Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
"弗兰基"也修好啦012---And you fixed the phalange?
没错  修好了012---Yes. The phalange's fixed.
而且012---As a matter of fact,
还又带了许多备用的012---we've put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard,
以防万一012---just in case.
-她在哪儿  -看不到012---- Where is she? - I don't see her.
-瑞秋  瑞秋·格林  -她在那里012---- Rachel! Rachel Green! - There she is!
瑞秋  瑞秋012---Rachel! Rachel!
先生  您有登机牌吗012---Whoa, do you have a boarding pass?

-天呐  -我知道  我知道012---- Oh, my God. - I know. I know.
不应该拖到现在才说的012---I shouldn't have waited till now to say it,
我太笨了  对不起012---but-- That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.
不过我现在和你说012---But I'm telling you now.
我爱你012---I love you.
