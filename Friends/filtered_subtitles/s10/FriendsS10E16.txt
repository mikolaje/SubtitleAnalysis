好  好  再玩一次  好吗012---All right, let's play one more time, okay?
记住如果我赢了012---And remember, if I win,
我赢了你就不能去巴黎012---you do not move to Paris.
好吧012---Okay.
不敢相信我又冒一次险012---I can't believe I'm risking this again,
但是来吧012---but you're on.
别忘了规则  乔伊012---All right, Joe, you remember the rules.
正面是我赢  反面是你输012---Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.
快点扔吧012---Just flip.
-啊  是反面  -该死的012---- Tails! - Damn it!
嘿  我们为你准备了一个送行会012---So we thought we'd throw you a little
7点钟开始012---going-away party around 7.
哦  听起来不错嘛012---Oh, that sounds good.
嘿  瑞秋  你明天就要走了012---Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
现在还不开始收拾012---Shouldn't you be packing?
-已经收拾好了  -哈  是嘛012---- It's all done. - Oh, yeah, right.
今天早上我冲澡的时候012---And after I took a shower this morning,
我还把毛巾扔在地上了012---I just threw my towel on the floor.
哦  天哪  就算是开玩笑我都心疼012---Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
我知道012---I know.
莫妮卡  我是说真的  我全都收拾好了012---Honey, seriously, I did it all.
要带的行李都在卧室里012---The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom.
这些是艾玛要在巴黎用的东西012---This is Emma's Paris stuff.
这些箱子都是要托运的012---These are the boxes that I'm having shipped...
那个是我打算飞机上吃的三明治012---...and that's the sandwich I made for the plane.
看起来你干得还不赖012---Okay, so you've done some good work.
是啊012---Yeah.
你的手提行李呢012---What about your carryons?
需要的东西全都在这个包里012---Oh, well, everything that I need is in here...
而旅行要用到的证件都在台子上012---...and my travel documents are on the counter...
我已经把它们按照使用顺序排好了012---...organized in the order that I will be needing them.
天啊  我好像没什么要教你的了012---Oh, my God. I have nothing left to teach you.
你的护照呢012---Where's your passport?
应该跟我的机票下面012---It should be next to my plane ticket.
嗯...没有啊012---Well, it's not.
没有吗  也许我放在这里了012---What? Well, maybe I put it in here?
噢  没有  不在这儿...012---Oh, it's not in there!
哦不会吧012---Oh, no,
我肯定是把它封在这些箱子里了...012---I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
-我来帮你   -倒霉...012---- Here, let me help you. - Shoot.
真不敢相信... 我竟然乱放012---I can't believe i did this.
从什么时间点开始012---At what point did
我把她的护照藏起来不好笑了012---it stop being funny that I took her passport?
《老友记》  第十季  第16集  给瑞秋饯行012---Friends S10E16 The One With Rachel's Going Away Party
只剩三个礼拜了  真是让人难以相信啊012---Oh, wow, can you believe you're only three weeks away?
是啊012---I know.
你不介意我摸你的肚子吧012---You don't mind me touching your belly?
我不介意你摸我的肚子012---No. I don't mind you touching my belly...
但是你的手现在好像012---...but your hand's kind of blocking the part
已经摸到孩子出生的地方了012---where the baby's gonna come out.
-嘿  -嗨012---- Hey! - Hey.
嘿  艾瑞卡  欢迎回来012---Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
哦  你都已经变得这么丰满了012---Wow, look how big you've gotten.
这是因为我怀孕了012---That's because I'm pregnant.
-哦  对  没错  我知道   -哦  好吧012---- Right. No, I understand. - Oh, okay.
我就是怕012---I'm just always afraid
别人以为我本来就是个胸大的胖妞012---that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
哦  不  不  我不会的012---No, no, I knew.
嘿  别死盯着她们啊012---Okay, well, stop staring at them.
是她先提起这事儿来的012---She brought them up.
你怎么这么快就回来了012---I didn't realize you were coming back so soon.
再过两个星期我就不能坐飞机了012---In a couple weeks I won't be able to travel.
我想让她先见见医生012---And I wanted her to get to know the doctors
然后在酒店安顿下来012---and get settled into the hotel.
酒店  为什么不让她和你们一起住012---Why isn't she staying with you guys?
因为我们马上就要搬了012---Because we're moving in a couple days
这样不行啊012---and it just didn't make sense.
酒店里很好玩儿啊012---Plus, hotels are fun!
我的房间里有个小冰柜里面塞满了零食012---My room has this little fridge
都是免费的012---full of free snacks.
艾瑞卡  那些零食可不是免费的012---Erica, those things aren't free.
实际上  酒店里的食品是最贵...012---They have one of the highest markups of any consumer product--
罗斯  她正准备给我们生个孩子012---Ross, she's giving us her baby.
就算她把你吃了都无所谓012---She can eat you if she wants.
我马上就回来012---I'll be right back.
真不敢相信你们就要离开这儿了012---Oh, man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
是啊...012---I know...
如果你想要这间公寓的话012---You know, you could take it if you want.
你可以住进来  租约还是奶奶的名字012---The lease is still in Nana's name.
哦  不  不  这里永远是属于你们的012---No, no. This will always be your place.
住在这儿太伤感了012---It would be too sad.
而且... 每个月乔伊会吃掉多少钱012---Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
两个人挣的都不够012---Yeah, it takes two incomes.
嘿  钱德勒在么012---Is Chandler here?
我们约好了要去看电影的012---We talked about catching a movie.
他可没那个闲工夫012---Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.
如果你有空012---You can go help him
你可以去客房帮他和乔伊一起收拾东西012---and Joey pack up the guest room.
是收拾东西呢   还是性感啦啦队员喜剧片012---Packing. Sexy cheerleader comedy.
是一个有帮助的好哥哥呢012---Helpful brother.
还是一个去看青春片的老衰人012---Creepy loner at teen movie.
你们俩干吗呢012---What are you guys doing?
快来试试  我一点儿都不疼012---Try it. I can't feel a thing.
你们开什么玩笑012---Are you kidding?
这叫收拾东西么012---This is packing?
我们累了  正在休息呢012---We're taking a break.
怎么会累着的012---From?
...刚才在床上蹦来着012---Jumping on the bed.
好了  瑞秋的送行会就快开始了012---All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours,
我们有一堆儿事情要做呢012---and there's a lot to do.
罗斯  别忘了你身上留着盖勒家的血012---Ross, you've got Geller blood.
你负责看着这两个家伙012---You're in charge of these yahoos.
-知道了  -好吧012---- You got it. - All right.
她说的对  我们得认真一点儿012---All right, she's right. We gotta get serious.
让我们把这个塞到他的裤裆里012---Let's put Styrofoam peanuts down his pants
然后踢他012---and kick him!
不  不  不  她说的对 我们得开始工作了012---No, guys, she's right. We should get to work.
我来把柜子里的东西搬出来012---I'll take stuff out of the closet.
乔伊你负责打包012---Joey, you pack them,
罗斯你负责把所有乔伊打过的包重打一遍012---and Ross, you repack whatever Joey packs.
你们听到有什么东西嗡嗡叫么012---You guys hear a ringing?
这是什么鬼玩意儿012---What the hell is this?
嘿  手铐  还裹着皮毛  真有你们的012---Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.
不知道你们还来这一手儿...012---I didn't know you guys had it in you.
钱德勒你没有妹妹012---Chandler, you don't have a sister,
所以你大概不能体会我现在012---so you can't understand...
有多闹心012---...how much this bums me out.
我不知道莫妮卡还有这玩意儿012---I didn't know Monica had these.
也许这是她用在别的男人身上的012---Maybe she used them with another boyfriend.
也许是理查德呢012---Maybe Richard.
为什么她和理查德玩儿这个  却不跟我玩儿012---Why would she use them with Richard and not me?
我也有怪癖啊012---I can be kinky.
有一次我还光着身子给她跳舞来着012---I once did a naked dance
当时我用的是领带012---for her with scarves.
越来越过分了...012---Bumming hard, guys. Bumming hard.
-嘿  -嗨  迈克呢012---- Hey. - Hey. Where's Mike?
他有一场演出...012---Oh, he has a gig.
我越来越觉得自己012---It's kind of like being married
像是个摇滚歌星的老婆了...012---to a rock star, you know?
我老公有场演出012---My husband has a gig.
在哪儿演出啊012---Yeah? Where is it?
是一个少儿滑旱冰的聚会012---Oh, he's playing organ
他去那儿弹琴012---for a children's roller-skating party.
还真够劲儿啊012---Rock on!
摆了这么大一桌子012---Wow, this is quite a spread.
这些都是什么啊012---What is all this stuff?
我觉得今天的晚会是一个好机会012---I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food...
我可以把所有不想带走的食物全都用了012---...that I don't want to move to the new house with me.
那么尽情享受吧012---So enjoy.
熏牡蛎卷拌早餐麦片012---Smoked oyster casserole with a breakfast-cereal crust.
四季豆加豆汁儿012---Kidney beans in their own juices,
然后甜点是...一个疑似过期的橙子012---and for dessert, a questionable orange.
嘿  瑞秋呢012---Where's Rach?
她在哄艾玛睡觉呢012---She's putting Emma down.
马上就过来012---She'll be over in a second.
可能是因为要走了012---It just hit her that she's leaving.
她现在情绪有点激动012---She's kind of emotional,
所以别刺激她  记住了么012---so no one say anything to set her off, okay?
-嘿  瑞秋  -嗨012---- Hey, Rach. - Hey.
她来了012---There she is.
嗨  大家好012---Hi, you guys.
我刚才怎么交待你们的012---What did I just say?
不  不  没事儿  我没事012---Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. I'm gonna be fine.
-过来  我给你弄点喝的  -好的012---- Come here, I'll make you a drink. - Okay.
天呐  我真不敢相信  她真的要走了012---Oh, man, I can't believe she's actually leaving.
让我怎么开得了口说再见啊012---How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
她对我来说这么重要...就好像012---I know, she's been such a big part of my life.
就好像《飞跃情海》被砍了一样012---It feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.
我是说..012---I mean....
不解释  我想念《飞跃情海》012---Forget it, I miss Melrose Place.
-我本来有机会阻止她的  -是吗012---- I had a chance to stop her too. - Yeah?
没想到猜钢崩儿我会连输57次012---Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row? You know?
正面她赢  反面我输012---Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.
等等...012---Wait a minute.
怎么了  乔伊012---Yes, Joe?
我忘了把衣服从干洗店拿回来了012---I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.
你还好吧012---So you doing okay?
嗯  我好多了012---Well, I've been better.
你们都会来看我的  对不对012---You guys are gonna come visit, right?
当然了012---Yes! You know,
再过6个月我的禁令就过期了012---in six months, the statute of limitations runs out...
到时候我又可以作国际旅行了012---...and I can travel internationally again.
-我一定会很想你的   -我也是012---- I'm gonna miss you so much. - I know.
你知道么012---You know what?
我对你们每个人都有些告别的话要说012---I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...
我本来打算在结束的时候说的012---...to each of you. I was gonna save it till the end of the night,
但是...跟我来012---but come here.
嘿  你们说她们到屋里去干吗012---Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
嗯  照我看来012---If I had to guess, I'd say...
肯定是瑞秋戴上塑料泡沫012---...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
然后菲比来动手打012---and Phoebe's doing the punching.
哦  菲比  我真不知道应该怎么开口012---Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
嗯  这样吧012---Okay, well, before you do,
我知道今天本来不需要给你准备礼物的012---I know we weren't supposed to get you presents...
但我还是准备了一个012---...but I do have something for you.
哦  哦  这是什么012---What is it?
是一个棉花棒012---Well, it's a cotton swab...
上面沾了些我的唾液012---...with a bit of my saliva on it...
这样一来 如果你在巴黎的时候012---...so that if they perfect the cloning process
发现那边的克隆技术成熟了012---while you're over there...
你就可以用这上面的DNA012---...you can use the DNA
来另外做一个菲比012---to create your own Pheebs.
我可能会把这个扔掉...012---I'm gonna throw this away...
但是我很感谢你这份心意...012---...but thank you so much for the gesture.
钱德勒012---Chandler?
我刚才在卧室的枕头上发现了这个012---I was just in our bedroom, and I found these on my pillow.
哦  我决定把这个先给你留着012---Oh, yes, I decided to leave those out for you
万一哪天理查德过来012---in case Richard stops by...
你可以跟他的胡子一起玩012---...and you want to engage in a little light bondage and mustache play.
你说什么呢  这不是我的012---What? These aren't mine.
啊  是吗012---Oh, yeah, right!
以后休想再让我给你跳领带舞了012---Good luck getting another scarf dance from me.
这种"惩罚"太可怕了012---That would be a terrible punishment.
我是说真的012---But I'm serious,
我以前从来没见过这东西012---I've never seen these before.
真的吗012---Really?
那它怎么会出现在我们的客房里的012---Then what are they doing in our guest room?
瑞秋曾经在那里住过012---Rachel used to live in that room.
瑞秋...  戴着手铐...012---Rachel. With handcuffs.
有意思012---Interesting.
光着屁股的乔伊012---Joey's bare ass.
真有你的012---Well played.
-我爱你  菲比  -我也爱你012---- I love you, Phoebe. - I love you too.
你..012---Please....
你可千万...012---Please don't--
别变成一个...法国婊子012---Don't turn into, you know, a French bitch.
好的012---I won't.
如果我想一个一个告别012---All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
我得继续找其他人了012---I better keep going.
-好的  -好的012---- Okay. - Okay.
-莫妮卡 -哦012---- Monica? - Yeah?
-跟我进来一下好吗  -当然012---- Will you come with me for a minute? - Sure.
-你的睫毛膏是防水的么   -不是啊012---- Are you wearing waterproof mascara? - No.
哦  你完蛋了012---Oh, you're so screwed.
嘿012---Hey.
这是怎么回事012---What was that all about?
她打算跟012---She's gonna say goodbye
我们每个人单独告别012---to each of us individually.
开什么玩笑  天呐012---Are you kidding? Oh, my God.
是啊  我知道012---Yeah, I know.
轮到你的时候可能会更糟012---It's gonna be even worse for you. God.
天呐  准备好好大哭一场吧012---Well, just get ready to do some serious crying.
天呐  我怕我会撑不过去012---Man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this.
我现在终于知道012---Now I know how my students feel
每个学期末我的学生们的感受了012---at the end of each year.
我猜他们是因为太舍不得我了012---And why they act out
所以才会在评定时给我打那么低的分数012---by giving me such bad evaluations.
莫妮卡  好吧012---Mon. Okay.
我就直说了  我想说的是...012---I better just say what it is I'm gonna say.
如果没有你012---None of the amazing things
我在过去十年里012---that have happened to me in the last 10 years...
我不可能会这么幸福012---...would have happened if it wasn't for you.
一直以来  你对我来说就像是姐妹一样012---No one has been more like a sister to me.
我知道你的意思012---I know what you mean.
我也一直把你当作姐妹012---You're like a sister to me too.
我不知道没有你我会怎么办012---I don't know what I'm going to do without you.
你是我做好的朋友012---You're the greatest friend I ever had.
...每天见到你012-----Seeing you every day.
你说什么012---What?
我...012---I--
每天都看见你012-----see you every day!
太让我感动了012---That is so sweet!
她已经搞掂莫妮卡了012---Oh, no, she took down Monica.
要知道在盖勒家我是最爱哭的012---And I'm the crier in the family.
天呐  可能该轮到我了012---Oh, God, I could be next.
如果我跟你说话012---Maybe she won't talk to me
她可能就不选我了012---if it looks like we're deep in conversation.
哦  那么说你之前说的那个什么012---Oh, so that thing you said about the thing...
让我想起了那个什么012---...it really made me think about that other thing.
瑞秋012---Rach?
好了  看起来钱德勒找上她了012---Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.
你想起了哪个什么啊012---I really made you think about that thing, huh?
瑞秋  我想这个应该是你的吧012---Rach, I think I have something that belongs to you.
你的笑话又来了  每次我都得逼着自己乐012---I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes
我将来一定会怀念这种感觉012---that I don't get.
不  不  这真的是你的012---No, no, they're really yours.
我们是在你住过的房间里找到的012---We found them in your old room.
但这不是我的啊012---These aren't mine.
也许这是莫妮卡以前和...012---Maybe Monica used to use them with--
别提理查德012---Don't say Richard.
如果这不是莫妮卡的012---Well, if they're not Monica's
也不是你的  那是谁的呢012---and they're not yours, then whose are they?
我想你大概忘了012---I think you're forgetting
在客房里住过的所有人里面  谁是最变态的012---the kinkiest former resident of that room.
-菲比  -嗯012---- Pheebs! - Yeah!
我想这个是你的吧012---I think these are yours.
这不是我的  稍微一使劲就坏了012---These are not mine. Look how flimsy they are. Come on.
如果你用这个把人栓在水管上面012---My God, you try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these...
一使劲就断掉了012---...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
-我能单独跟你谈谈么  -当然012---- Can I talk to you alone for a minute? - Sure.
你不会真的把人拷在水管上吧012---You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes do you?
你以为迈克现在在哪儿012---Where do you think Mike really is?
哦  亲爱的012---Oh, honey....
让我先说两句吧012---Let me just saying something
要不然待会儿一旦我觉得不自然012---because once we get into this...
我可能又该012---...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
开始开无聊的玩笑了012---and probably make some stupid joke.
我就是想说  我...我爱你012---I just want to say that l-- I love you.
还有就是  我会想你的012---And I'm gonna miss you.
你就这么走了  我真的很难过012---And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
你知道吗012---Oh, you know what?
其它的什么也不用说了012---Let's not say anything else.
我也爱你012---I love you.
别抱的这么紧012---Not so tight.
对不起  再给我一次机会012---I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
好吧012---Okay.
好吧012---Okay.
走吧  走吧  我控制不了自己012---I'm sorry. Just go. Just go. I can't. I can't.
看来你是下一个了  准备好了没有012---So I guess you're next. You ready?
还没有012---I don't think so.
显然你没有012---Oh, you're definitely not.
我几年都没有这么哭过了012---I haven't cried like that in years.
昨天晚上你还对着六点钟的新闻哭来着012---You cried yesterday at the 6:00 news.
那个老太太被人骗得好惨012---That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
天呐  没想到她居然把我排在最后012---God, I can't believe she saved me for last.
他们俩怎么还没说完012---Why are they taking so long?
我也不知道012---I don't know.
不过看起来乔伊好像没什么事儿一样  真是意外012---But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.
-不  -不  乔伊012---- No! - No! Joey!
好了  轮到我了012---Okay, here we go.
-啊  好吧  -嗯012---- Well.... - Yeah.
我想我该走了012---I think I'm gonna take off.
哦大伙  真是奇妙的夜晚啊012---Oh, you guys, this was an amazing night.
非常感谢012---Thank you so much.
我爱你们012---I love you.
晚安012---Good night.
什么012---What?!
都不和我说再见的012---I don't get a goodbye?
你这个幸运的混蛋012---Lucky bastard.
我简直不敢相信012---Unbelievable.
她跟你们每个人告别  却不跟我说012---She says goodbye to everyone but me!
也许她觉得你们这么多年的默契012---Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history,
一切都...012---it could be...
"尽在不言中"了呢012---...you know, implicit.
那需要"言"的012---Well, it needs to be "plicit."
我们好好想想012---All right, let's think about this.
肯定是有什么原因的012---I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.
你是不是惹她生气了012---Did you do anything to make her mad?
没有啊012---No, I don't think so.
