- 大家好 - 菲比012---- Hi, guys. JOEY: Hey, Phoebe.
情况如何？012---Hey, oh, how did it go?
不是太好012---Um, not so good.
他送我到地铁站 并且说〝我们该再这么做〞012---He walked me to the subway and said, "We should do this again."
什么？他说〝我们该再这么做〞012---- Ouch. - What? He said, "We should do it again."
那是件好事吧012---That's good, right?
不，简单地翻译 〝我们该再这么做〞是指012---Uh, no. Loosely translated, "We should do this again," means:
〝你再也看不到我的裸体〞012---"You will never see me naked."
从什么时候开始？012---Since when?
一直都是这样，那是种约会语言012---Since always. It's, like, dating language.
〝那与你无关〞 意思是〝全都是你的错〞012---You know, like, "It's not you," means, "It is you."
〝你是个好人〞意思是012---"You're such a nice guy," means:
〝我要跟穿着皮衣的酒鬼约会012---"I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics...
跟他们抱怨你的事〞012---...and complaining about them to you."
〝我想我们该跟别人交往看看〞 意思是指012---Or, you know, um, "I think we should see other people," means:
〝我已经那么做了〞012---"Ha, ha, I already am."
大家都知道这些事？012---And everybody knows this?
对，降低冲击力012---Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.
像是你小的时候 爸妈将你的狗安乐死012---Like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep...
跟你说他逃跑到农场去了012---...and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
那真的很好笑 不，因为我们的爸妈真的…012---That's funny. No, because, uh, our parents actually did...
把我们的狗送到农场去012---...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
罗斯012---Uh, Ross?
康涅狄格州的麦纳农场？012---Ha, ha. Hello. The Milner's farm in Connecticut?
麦纳夫妇有座超棒的农场012---The Milners, they had this unbelievable farm.
他们养了马跟兔子 他可以追着他们玩012---They had horses and rabbits that he could chase.
那是…012---And it was...
天啊，奇奇012---Oh, my God. Chi-Chi.
《老友记》  第一季  第3集  见友弃色012---Friends S01E03: The One with the Thumb
〝知道自己快死掉时 那是什么样的感觉？〞012---"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
典狱长，五分钟后我将不再痛苦012---Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.
但你得一辈子受到良心谴责 知道自己送一个诚实的人去死012---But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
- 那真的很不错 - 是吗？012---- Hey, that was really good. - Yeah?
- 对 - 谢了 继续吧012---- Yeah. - Thanks. Let's keep going.
好吧， 你要我怎么做？迪蒙012---Okay. "So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?"
我只想回我的牢房 因为在我的牢房里，我能抽烟012---I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell, I can smoke.
你就抽吧012---"Smoke away."
嘿012---Heh.
我想这是迪蒙 独自在牢房抽烟的原因012---I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.
- 什么？ - 手放轻松012---- What? - Relax your hand.
手腕下垂012---Let your wrist go.
- 别垂得那么低  - 哇012---- Not so much.  - Whoa.
嘿012---Hey.
好吧，试着抽一口012---All right. Now try taking a puff.
对012---Right.
- 好吧，不，快给我 - 不，我才不要给你烟012---- Okay, no, give it to me. - No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.
没关系的，听着 你要不要这个角色？来吧012---No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want to get this part or not? Here.
好吧，别当这是香烟012---All right. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.
当它是从你手里不见的东西012---Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.
拿着它，你觉得安心012---When you're holding it, you feel right.
- 你觉得圆满 - 你想念它吗？012---- You feel complete. - You miss it?
不，不是很想012---No, not so much.
好吧，现在抽一口012---All right. Now we smoke.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
不012---No, no, no.
他们说那个的长度 跟男人拇指尖012---They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb...
到食指尖的距离一样012---...to the tip of his index finger.
那太夸张了012---That's ridiculous.
我可以用另一只手的拇指吗？012---Can I use either thumb?
好吧，别告诉我012---All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.
乔伊是无咖啡因的卡布奇诺012---Decaf cappuccino for Joey.
黑咖啡012---Coffee, black.
拿铁012---Latte.
冰茶012---And an iced tea.
- 我真的很厉害 - 太好了，非常不错012---- I'm getting pretty good at this. - Excellent. That's very good.
我太神了012---Good for me.
- 你还好吧？菲比 - 对，不，那根本不值得…012---- You okay, Phoebe? - Yeah, no, it's not even worth...
是我的银行012---It's my bank.
他们对你做了什么？012---What did they do to you?
没事，只不过…好的012---It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
我看邮件时打开他们的月报表012---I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly "statement."
别激动012---Easy.
我的账户多了五百块012---And there's 500 extra dollars in my account.
撒旦的手下又发威了012---Oh, Satan's minions at work again.
对，我得去银行跟他们谈012---Yes, because now I have to go down there and deal with them...
- 你干嘛说呢？ 留下那笔钱 - 那不是我的钱012---- What are you talking about? Keep it. - It's not mine.
那不是我赚来的 留下来那笔钱就等于我偷钱012---I didn't earn it. If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
对，把它花掉，可以享受血拼乐趣012---Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.
好的012---Okay. Okay.
假设我买了一双很棒的鞋子012---Let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.
你们知道我每跨出一步 会听到什么吗？012---Do you know what I'd hear with every step I took?
〝不是我的钱〞012---"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."
即使我开心地飞舞012---And even if I was happy, okay, and skipping...
我会听到〝不是我的钱〞012---...I'd hear, "Not mine. Not mine."
我们同意你的说法，我们了解012---We're with you. We got it.
好吧，我无法享受乐趣 那是一大道德考验012---Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be like this giant karmic debt.
钱德，你在做什么？012---Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.
你在做什么？012---What are you doing?
超恶心的012---Oh, gross.
- 这是怎么一回事？ - 我在抽烟012---- What is this? - I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking.
我不相信，三年来你表现很好012---I can't believe you. You've been so good for three years.
这是我的奖励012---And this is my reward.
等一下，想想上次戒烟时你吃的苦012---Hold on a second. Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
好吧，所以这次我不戒烟012---Okay, so this time I won't quit.
- 把烟熄了 - 好吧，我熄了就是012---- Put it out. - All right. I'm putting it out.
不012---Oh, no.
现在我没办法喝咖啡了012---I can't drink this now.
好吧，我要去换衣服，我有约会012---All right, I'm gonna go change. I've got a date.
又是亚伦？情况如何？012---Is this Alan again? How's it going?
非常不错，你们知道吗？ 我们相处既愉快又开心012---It's going pretty good, you know? It's nice and we're having fun.
- 我们何时能见到这家伙？ - 对012---- So when do we get to meet the guy? ROSS: Yeah.
让我想一想，今天是星期一012---Let's see, today's Monday...
- 永远不可能 - 少来了012---- Never. - Come on.
- 不，在史提夫后是不可能了 - 你在胡说什么？012---- No, not after what happened with Steve. - What are you talking about?
我们爱史提夫，史提夫超性感012---We love Steve. Steve was sexy.
抱歉012---Sorry.
我不知道我对他有什么感觉 给我机会弄清楚012---Look, I don't know how I feel about him yet. Give me a chance to figure it out.
然后我们能跟他见面？012---Well, then can we meet him?
不行012---No.
抱歉012---Sorry.
为什么我要让他们跟他见面？012---Why should I let them meet him?
我带男人回家 五分钟内他们围着他问个不停012---I bring a guy home and within five minutes they're all over him.
他们像是土狼，专挑弱小猎物下手012---I mean, they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.
听着 对一个什么倒霉事都遇过的人来说012---Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef...
我想那不算是太糟糕012---...I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.
他们是你的朋友，他们关心你012---Come on, they're your friends. They're looking out after you.
我知道，我希望 我能带个他们喜欢的男人回家012---I know, I know. I wish that once I'd bring a guy home they actually liked.
你知道 如果他们永远不跟这个男的见面012---Well, you do realize that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer...
机率会更小的012---...if they never get to meet the guy.
算了吧，罗斯012---Let it go, Ross.
是吗？你根本不认识奇奇012---Yeah? Well, you didn't know Chi-Chi.
你们都保证吗？012---MONICA: Do you all promise?
- 对，我们保证，我们会很乖的 - 我们保证012---- Yeah, we promise. We'll be good. JOEY: We promise.
钱德，你保证会很乖吗？012---Chandler, do you promise to be good?
你可以进来，但你的烟得放在外面012---You can come in, but your filter tip little buddy has to stay outside.
菲比012---ROSS: Hey, Pheebs.
〝亲爱的布非小姐 谢谢你通知我们犯了错012---"Dear Ms. Buffay: Thank you for calling attention to our error.
我们将五百块汇到你的账户 抱歉造成你的不便012---We have credited your account $500. We're sorry for the inconvenience...

嗯？012---Hmm?
来吧012---Come on.
我先来012---I'll go.
从他一直挑…012---Let's start with the way he kept picking at...
对不起，我办不到012---You know, I'm sorry, I can't do this.
我办不到，我们爱他012---Can't do it. We loved him.

对012---GROUP: Yeah.
你们知道哪一点最棒吧？ 他的笑容有点坏坏的012---Know what was great? The way his smile was kind of crooked.

什么鞋子？012---What shoe?
童谣里的歌词012---From the nursery rhyme.
〝有个坏男人，带着坏坏的笑容012---"There was a crooked man who had a crooked smile...
他在鞋子里住了一阵子〞012---...who lived in a shoe for a while..."
我想亚伦012---So I think Alan...
成为标杆012---...will become the yardstick...
用来评估你未来所有的男朋友012---...against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
什么未来的男朋友？012---What future boyfriends?
不，我想就是他了012---No, no. I think this could be, you know, "it."
- 真的吗？ - 对012---- Really? - Oh, yeah.
我会嫁给他，因为他的表情 跟大卫赫索霍夫一样012---I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.
你们知道我在派对上会怎么做吧？012---You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
- 你们知道我最喜欢他哪一点吗？ - 什么？012---- You know what I like most about him? - What?

- 亚伦 - 他太不可思议了012---- Alan. - He was unbelievable.
他跟兔宝宝卡通里 每个位置都是兔宝宝一样012---He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions.
但他不是兔宝宝 - 垒，亚伦、二垒，亚伦012---But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan...
他让我们成为真正的球队012---I mean, it was like he made us into a team.
对，我们真的 让那些东正教犹太人珠宝商012---Yep. We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers...
- 知道我们多会打垒球 - 太棒了012---...a thing or two about softball. - Nice.

你们会不会觉得亚伦有时候…012---Do you ever think that Alan is maybe sometimes...
- 什么？ - 我不知道，有点太亚伦了012---- What? - I don't know. A little too Alan?
不，那是不可能的 他不可能会太亚伦012---Oh, no. That's not possible. You can never be too Alan.
对，我们爱的是亚伦的内在012---Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness that we adore.

我接受那些缺点 为什么你们不接受这样的我？012---I accept all those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this?
按压手指会困扰大家还是只有他？012---Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?
那个嘛…012---Well...
没有它，我可以过得更好012---...I could live without it.
呵012---Huh.
它有点讨厌或跟菲比咬头发一样？012---Well, is it, like, a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
