怎么会有人知道 你的信用卡号码012---How'd someone get your credit card number?
我也不知道 看看他们花了多少钱012---I have no idea. Look how much they spent!
摩妮卡，冷静点，信用卡公司说 你只要付你有买东西的钱012---Calm down. You only have to pay for the stuff you bought.
但这真的是挥霍无度012---Still, it's just such reckless spending.
我想他们偷你的信用卡时…012---When somebody steals your credit card...
早就将王法抛诸脑后了012---...they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
哇，真是怪人 花了美金69点95元买神奇拖把012---Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
是我买的012---That's me.
噢，嗯心012---Oh! Oh, the yuck.
他又来了012---He's doing it again!
马塞尔，别再侵犯那盏灯了012---Marcel, stop humping the lamp!
不要这样 马塞尔，回来！012---Stop humping! Now, Marcel, come back!
过来这里，．马塞尔012---Come here, Marcel!
不要！别去我房间！ 我去抓他012---Oh, no, no! Not in my room! I'll get him.
罗斯，你得想想办法012---You've got to do something about the humping.
干嘛？只是阶段性而已012---What? It's just a phase.
我们也是那样说乔伊的012---Well, that's what we said about Joey.
放轻松点好吗  没什么大不了的012---Hey, would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
马塞尔，给我停止！ 马塞尔！你这个坏猴子012---RACHEL: Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
怎么了012---- What? RACHEL: Ugh!
就说我的好奇娃娃 已经不再好奇了吧012---Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.

摩妮卡 你不会还在 看那个东西吧012---Ugh, Monica, you are not still going over that thing.
- 这个女人过着我的生活 - 什么012---- This woman's living my life. - What?
她在过我的生活 而且过得比我好012---She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me.
你看看这个，看012---Look at this. Look.
她买票去看我想看的戏012---She buys tickets to plays I want to see.
她买的衣服 是我早就想买的012---She shops at stores that I'm intimidated by the salespeople.
她花三百美金在美术用品上012---She spent $300 on art supplies.
你又不是艺术家012---You're not an artist.
如果我有那些东西 或许就可以了012---Yeah, well, I might be if I had the supplies.
这些我都可以做啊 只是我都没做012---I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
摩妮卡，别这样 你也做很多很棒的事情啊012---Oh, Monica, come on. You do cool things.
是吗  来比较一下吧012---Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we?
现在做比较 会不会太晚了012---Oh, it's so late for "shall we?"
我会去公园骑马吗012---Do I go horseback riding in the park, hmm?
我会在新学院大学上课吗012---Do I take classes at The New School?
- 不会 - 不会012---- No. - No.
太不公平了012---This is so unfair.
她有所有我要的东西 而且不用应付我妈012---She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
乔伊·帕帕尼如何012---How about Joey Paponi?
不行，太有种族意味了 我的经纪人觉得要取中立一点的名字012---No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
乔伊·瑞士012---Joey Switzerland?
而且我觉得叫乔就好  乔伊听起来好像我只有…012---Plus I think it should be Joe. Joey makes me sound like I'm...
这么大而已012---...this big.
但我并不是012---Which I'm not!
乔、乔、乔… 史达林012---Joe, Joe, Joe... Stalin?
史达林012---Stalin.
我听过那个名字吗  好耳熟012---Do I know that name? That sounds familiar.
我没印象012---- Well, it does not ring a bell with me. - Huh.
乔·史达林012---Joe Stalin.
还挺不错的012---You know, that's pretty good.
还可以试试乔瑟夫012---You might want to try Joseph. - Ah!
乔瑟夫·史达林！012---Joseph Stalin!
- 大家一定会记得！ - 当然啦！012---- I think you'd remember that! - Oh, yes!

- 嘿 - 嘿012---- Hey. - Hey.
嗨012---Hi.
我是摩妮卡·盖勒 嗨012---Hi. Uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.
我在你们那边上课 我想知道是什么课程012---Um, I'm taking classes with you, and I was wondering what they were.
你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
好，太好了012---All right, great.
好，谢谢了012---Great. Thanks a lot.
我要去上踢踏舞课了012---I'm going to tap class.
好让你跟偷了你信用卡的女人 一起跳舞吗012---So you can dance with the woman that stole your card?
她偷了我的人生 我想知道她是谁012---She's got my life. I want to see who she is.
那就去邮局啊！ 我相信里面有张贴她的照片012---Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up!
亲爱的，你快失控了012---Honey, you're kind of losing it here.
这已经变成怪异的执迷012---This is really becoming a weird obsession.
这太疯狂了  我告诉你012---This is madness, I tell you.
上帝保佑，摩妮卡 别这么做012---For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!
谢谢012---Thank you.
你们怎么想012---What do you think?
想很多事情012---Lots of things.
你觉得她是哪一个012---Which one do you think she is?
- 有我可以效劳的地方吗  - 不用了，谢谢012---- May I help you? - Oh, no, thanks.
我们只是来参观的012---We're just here to observe.
舞蹈课不是用来参观的  要用跳的012---You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class!
那边有鞋子012---Spare shoes are over there.
什么意思012---What does she mean?
我想她是说 〝舞蹈课…012---I think she means, "You dance...
要用跳的！〞012---...a dance class!"
来吧…！012---Come on, come on, come on!
真的吗012---Really?
嘿，你有看到我的分身吗012---Hey, do you see anybody you think could be me?
各位，上次下课后 有人留下优格空瓶012---People, last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class.
不要再让这种事发生了！012---Let's not have that happen again!
她可以当你的分身012---She could be you.
开始吧012---Let's get started.
五、六 五、六、七、八012---Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.
好，我完全不会！012---Okay, I'm not getting this!
我超会的！012---I'm totally getting it!
你会觉得自己 超不协调的吗012---Do you ever just feel like you're so unbelievably uncoordinated?
干嘛 他们踢的时候 跟着踢就是了012---What? You just click when they click.
好吧，各位，找个舞伴012---All right. Now everyone grab a partner.
哦！哦012---Oh! Oh.
我死去的母亲说 就是你，我跟瑞秋是舞伴012---All right. And my dead mother said you are it! I'm with Rachel.
太好了，体育课的旧事又重演了012---Great, it's gym class all over again.
哦012---RACHEL & PHOEBE: Aww.
没关系，你可以来前面 跟我搭档012---That's all right. You can come up to the front and dance with me.
我还不如脱掉衣服 做个恶梦算了012---Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare?
没关系了 我来了  很抱歉我迟到了012---It's okay, it's okay! I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.
好，我到了012---Okay, here I am.
这位紧张的新人是谁012---So who's the new tense girl?
她是你的舞伴012---She's your partner.
- 嗨，我是摩妮卡 - 嗨012---- Hi, I'm Monica. - Hi.
哦，呵012---Oh, ha.
摩妮卡012---Monica.
嗨，我是摩…012---Hi, I'm Mon...
娜娜012---Nana.
- 摩娜娜  - 是的012---- Monana? - Yeah.
是荷兰语012---It's Dutch.
开玩笑吧  我在阿姆斯特丹住了三年012---You're kidding. I spent three years in Amsterdam.
我是宾州的荷兰人012---Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
要跳舞了！012---And we're dancing!
五、六、七、八012---Five, six, seven, eight.
嗨012---Hi.
- 嘿 - 嘿012---- Hey. - Hey.
- 你去哪了  - 我刚从兽医那里回来012---- Where have you been? - I just got back from the vet.
她不会叫你戴那些塑胶头套吧012---She's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone, is she?
她说马塞尔乱性不是暂时的012---She says Marcel's humping thing is not a phase.
显然他已经性成熟了012---Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.
嘿，他比你还快耶！012---Hey, he beat you!
她说他会愈来愈暴力 侵略性愈来愈强012---She says, as time goes on, he'll start getting aggressive and violent.
什么意思012---What does this mean?
我得放弃他012---I have to give him up.
我不敢相信，罗斯 这太扯了！012---I can't believe it. This sucks!
我不懂，你才刚养他 怎么可能已经成年了012---You just got him. How could he be an adult already?
我知道  前一天 才小小只的…012---I know, I know. One day he's this little thing...
不知不觉中 就变成…012---...and before you know it, he's this little thing...
紧抓我的腿不放的小东西012---...I can't get off my leg.
没有办法能让你留下他吗012---Isn't there any way you can keep him?
没有012---No. No.
兽医说除非有个地方…012---The vet said that unless he's in a place where he has regular access...
让他获得正常的猴爱012---...to some monkey loving...
否则他会愈来愈残暴012---...he's just gonna get vicious.
我得把他送到动物园012---I just gotta get him into a zoo.
- 要怎么把猴子送到动物园  - 我知道！012---- How do you get a monkey into a zoo? - I know that one!
不，那是教宗 进入福斯汽车012---No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.
我们申请了很多动物园 首要选择当然是州立动物园012---We're applying to a lot of them. Our first choice would be a state zoo.
像是圣地牙哥012---You know, like, uh, San Diego.
对吧012---Right?
但那可能是遥不可及的梦想  因为他来自州外012---But that may just be a pipe dream because he's out-of-state.
我的兽医在迈阿密有认识人 所以有可能去那里012---My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
但那里离海滩只有两条街  一定是轰趴动物园012---But that's two blocks from the beach. It's a total party zoo.
嘿012---- Hey. CHANDLER: Hey.
- 嗨 - 我们找到那个女生了！012---- Hi. - We found the girl!
- 什么  - 有打电话给警察吗012---- What? - Did you call the cops?
没有，我们请她吃午餐012---Nope. We took her to lunch.
你们自己的私自执法方式012---Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
你疯了吗  这个女人偷了你的东西！012---Are you insane? This woman stole from you!
她偷东西，是小偷耶012---She stole! She's a stealer!
跟她相处十分钟之后 你就会忘掉这些了012---After you're with this woman for 10 minutes, you forget all that.
她真的是个奇女子…012---I mean, she's this astounding person...
振奋人心！012---...with this amazing spirit!
是啊，可能是从啦啦队员 那里偷来的！012---Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader!
- 把帽子脱掉 - 福斯车里的教宗！012---- Take off their hats. - Popes in a Volkswagen!
嗯哼012---Mm-hm.
我超爱那个笑话012---I love that joke.
- 不可能！你不可能这么做！ - 摩娜娜很勇敢012---- No way! No way did you do this! - Monana was very brave.
超狂野的012---It was so wild.
我们跟他们说我们是 615号房的刚氏姐妹…012---We told them we were the Gunnersons in room 615...
才知道波士顿的《塞尔蒂克队》 包下整个六楼！012---...only to find out the Boston Celtics had the entire sixth floor!
当他们发现 我们很矮而且有胸部后012---So when they caught on to the fact that we're short and have breasts...
就把我们轰出去 我被饭店赶出去，我耶！012---They threw us out. I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
好样的，摩娜娜！012---Go, Monana!
不是只有你们活在梦想中012---Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream.
我得去为我不认识的人 倒咖啡了，不用等我了012---I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
噢，还有一件事…012---Oh, by the way...
我们明天要去参加 百老汇的试镜012---...tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
什么012---Excuse me?
《猫》剧有一个缺额012---There's an open call for Cats.
我想说我们可以去 演唱《回忆》…012---I'm thinking we go down there, sing "Memories"...
把自己当成傻子 你觉得如何？012---...and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say?
不、不、不012---No, no, no.
要记得我是什么样的人012---Remember who you're dealing with here. Ha.
我不像你，我连站在 踢踏舞教室前面都有困难012---I'm not like you. I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
那大概是因为你有孟诺教派的背景012---That's because of your Amish background.
- 什么  - 你是宾州的荷兰人 对吧012---- What? - Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
对012---Right.
直到我买了吹风机 就被逐出村里012---Till I bought a blow dryer. Then I was shunned.
我以前就跟你一样012---I was just like you.
然后有一天，我看了一部 改变我一生的电影012---And then one day, I saw a movie that changed my life.
你有看过《春风化雨》吗012---- Did you ever see Dead Poets Society? - Uh-huh.
我觉得那部电影超级…012---I thought that movie was so incredibly...
无聊的！012---...boring!
最后那个孩子自杀…012---I mean, that thing at the end where the kid...
只因为不能参与话剧演出012---...kills himself because he can't be in the play?
搞什么012---What was that?
拜托，等个一年 离家参与社区话团演出不就行了012---It's like, "Kid, wait a year. Leave home, do some community theater!"
我走出戏院后心想…012---I walked out of there, and I thought:
〝我浪费了永远拿不回来的 两小时生命〞012---"Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back!"
那个想法震撼了我 让我及时行乐012---And that scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
哇012---Wow.
那我绝对不推荐你看 《窈窕奶爸》012---Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
天啊012---Oh, God.
我们进不了斯克兰顿012---We didn't get into Scranton.
那是我们的保障动物园012---That was our safety zoo.
他们连狗和牛都收012---They take, like, dogs and cows.
看吧012---See?
我不懂是我还是他 比较难受012---I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
我想是那张椅子最难受012---I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.
马塞尔，马塞尔012---ROSS: Marcel. Marcel.
马塞尔，不要弄了012---Marcel, no.
好孩子！012---Good boy!
看到了吗  怎么可能没人要他012---See? How can nobody want him?
会有人要的012---Somebody will.
你们知道 已经有位乔瑟夫史达林了吗012---You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
你在开玩笑吧！012---You're kidding!
显然他是个俄国独裁者 屠杀过很多人012---Apparently, he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people!
- 你会想说这种事情应该要知道的！ - 你会想说我该知道的012---- You'd think you would've known that! - You'd think I would've.
菲比  你觉得什么艺名 适合我012---Phoebe, what do you think a good stage name for me would be?
火焰男孩012---Flame Boy!
你的动物园在哪里012---Where exactly is your zoo?
严格来说，它不能算是动物园012---Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.
它比较像是互动的野生体验012---It's, uh, more of an interactive wildlife experience.
让我问问你几个问题 他叫做马塞尔对吧？012---Let me ask you some questions about... Is it, uh, Marcel?
对对012---- Yes. - Yes. Uh...
他会和其他动物打架吗012---Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
不会，他非常温驯012---No, no. He's very docile.
即使被逼到角落去也一样吗012---Hmm. Even if he were cornered?
嗯，我不太清楚 为什么问？012---Well, I don't know. Why?
他掌控小东西的能力为何012---Um, how is he at handling small objects?
他可以握住香蕉 如果你是这个意思的话012---He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.
铁槌或小刀呢012---What about a hammer or a small blade?
他为什么会需要小刀012---Why would he need a blade?
如果他得面对猎豹 或有角的动物…012---If he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns...
总得给他点东西 自我防卫吧012---...you got to give the little guy something.
不然就太残忍了！012---Otherwise, it's just cruel!
他能去圣地牙哥了！012---He got into San Diego!
- 什么  - 对012---- What? - Yeah.
我们散步回来后 电话响起012---We were coming back from our walk, and the phone was ringing...
- 他进了  - 他进了012---- He's in! - He's in? Ah!
你有听到吗  马塞尔012---Did you hear that, Marcel?
是圣地牙哥耶  太棒了012---San Diego! San Diego! Yeah!
你真的犯下大错 圣地牙哥的环境是很不错…012---You're making a mistake. San Diego's well and good...
但如果你把他交给我 我会训练他对抗瞎眼的兔子…012---...but if you give him to me, I'll start him against a blind rabbit...
还给你百分之二十的门票收入012---...and give you 20 percent of the gate.
哟嗬！012---Yo-ho!
你去哪里了012---Where have you been?
摩妮卡和我跑去 大使馆派对012---Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
你喝醉了吗012---Are you drunk?
才没有！012---No!
我说谎012---I'm lying.

我一直在家里担心你012---I've been up here. I've been worried...
摩妮卡012---Monica.
摩妮卡012---Monica?
水超棒的！012---Water rules!
是的，没错012---Yes. Yes, it does.

你在干嘛？你会失去你的工作 这一点都不像你012---What are you doing? You're gonna lose your job. This is not you!
不，这正是我！012---No, it is me!
我不只是那种必须拍松枕头…012---I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows...
帐单一来就立刻缴钱的人012---...and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
我跟她在一起时 就不再是那样的人！012---You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that!

因为…012---Because...
我是摩妮卡盖勒012---...I'm Monica Geller.
你之前用的是我的信用卡012---It was my credit card you were using.
这点我完全没料到012---That I was not expecting.
我想让你知道 报案的人不是我012---I want you to know, I didn't turn you in.
哦012---Oh.

如果不是你 我永远无法…012---If it wasn't for you, I'd never have gotten...
在冬花园剧院演唱《回忆》012---...to sing "Memories" at the Winter Garden Theater.
其实你只开口唱了〝回〞而已012---Actually, you only got to sing "Memo..."
我不敢相信你在这里 没有你我该怎么办012---I can't believe you're in here. What am I gonna do without you?
谁会跟我混进大使馆宴会012---Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
谁要带我去看大苹果马戏团012---Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
摩妮卡，我每天早上都得 在二十五个人面前尿尿…012---Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women...
你却担心 谁要带你去看大苹果马戏团012---...and you're worried about who will take you to the Big Apple Circus?
也不是担心 我只是纳闷而已012---Well, not worried, you know, just wondering.
没什么好纳闷的012---There's nothing to wonder about.
你就回去过以前的生活 因为那才是真正的你012---You'll go back to being who you were because that's who you are.
- 也不尽然 - 就是这样012---- Not necessarily. - Yes, necessarily.
我不知道是为什么 或许和你是孟诺教派的人有关012---I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the Amish thing.
我其实不是孟诺教派的人012---Um, I'm not actually Amish.
真的吗  那你为何那么像012---Really? Then why are you like that?
站在门边的那个 要不要加入012---You by the door, in or out?
要！012---In!
后面的那个，你全都跳错了！012---You in the back, you're getting it wrong!
至少我有在即目012---At least I'm doing it!
这是飞往圣地牙哥 67航班的最后登机通知012---WOMAN [OVER PA]: This is the final boarding call for Flight 67 to San Diego...
