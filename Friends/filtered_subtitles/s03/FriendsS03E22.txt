因为瑞秋和我交往过012---Well, you know, because Rachel and I used to go out. Ha, ha.
我不知道012---Oh, I didn't know that.
那这才叫尴尬012---Well, then this is awkward.

他对陌生人大吼大叫012---He viciously screamed at total strangers.
我觉得他很糟糕012---I think he's bad news.
等一下  你不喜欢瑞秋的约会对象012---Wait a minute, wait a minute. You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?
奇怪啊012---Well, that's odd.
嘿  萝伦  各位  这是凯特的候补演员萝伦012---Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.

就在我跟乔伊上床之后  第二天就甩了我012---It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
你们是怎么认识的012---So how'd you guys meet?
简单的说  我追了她两个月012---Well, uh, the short version is, I pursued her for a couple of months.
给她一张两万美元的支票后  就搞定了012---Then I gave her a check for $20,000 and she was mine.
复杂点说  我因为他说话太简单  而甩了他012---Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.

罗斯  我要走了  走  为什么012---Ross, I'm gonna go. Go? Why?
不知道  或许是因为…012---I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like...
我不想整晚等着看一个人  会不会发疯012---...standing around all night, waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
但是  凯琳…012---Oh, but Cailin...

祝你们两家…012---A plague...
发生灾难012---...on both your houses.
对了  他看完我的剧评之后  把我甩了012---By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
真过分012---Oh, classy.
是啊012---Yep.
是啊  我还真有眼光012---I sure know how to pick them, huh?
我为了这出戏  放弃了一个连续剧012---You know I gave up a part on a soap for this?
我也放弃了一个工作012---Yeah, I, uh... I gave up a job too.
什么工作  替猫味剪指甲012---Really? What? Uh, declawing cats.

我们去每个报摊  烧掉所有的《时代杂志》和《邮报》012---We'll stop by every newsstand and burn every copy of their Times and The Post.
为什么要烧《邮报》  你没看《邮报》012---Why The Post? You didn't see The Post?

等一下  怎么了012---Wait. Wait a minute. What?
我实在搞不懂你012---I don't get you.
你先是讨厌我012---I mean, first you hate me.
然后跟我上床012---Then you sleep with me.
然后你又跟我撇清关系  现在又想要我了012---Then you want nothing to do with me. Now you want me again?
怎样   你没跟女演员约过会吗012---What? So you never went out with an actress before?
凯特  你喜欢我吗012---Kate, do you even like me?
当然喜欢  那你之前为什么拒绝我012---Of course I do. So how come you blew me off?
为什么要跟他在一起   我不知道012---You know, how come you were with him? I don't know.
我就是这样012---I just do this.
我总是要挑最聪明的…012---I always have to pick, like, the smartest guy...
或是最有才华的012---...or the most talented guy.
我为什么不能挑你这种人012---Why can't I just pick someone like you?

后来她昏过去了012---Then she passed out.
但是她醒来之后012---But then she woke up. Yeah.
我们聊了一整晚012---And we stayed up all night talking.
我们现在为彼此而疯狂012---And now we're, like, totally crazy about each other.
你经历了"爱之夜"  什么012---Joey, you had "the night." What?
当两个人发现坠人爱河后012---When two people finally realize their feelings for each other...
他们会聊上很久  弄清楚对方的一切012---...and they talk for hours and they learn all about the other person.
是吗012---You think?
你知道她家人的事吗  两个兄弟  一个死了012---Ha, ha. Did you learn about her family? Two brothers. One died.
太棒了  好012---Yes. Yeah.

好吧  我觉得  你不该跟汤米继续来往012---All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
是吗  对012---You don't? No.
那家伙态度很恶劣  非常恶劣  你应该离他远一点012---The guy is mean. I mean, really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
或许我应该离所有男人远一点012---Hmm. Or maybe I should stay away from all men.
我不只是在嫉妒012---No, it's not just because I'm jealous.
我不是在嫉妒012---I mean, I'm not, I'm not. I'm not jealous, okay?
那家伙…012---Look, the guy, he screamed...
对坐错位子的夫妇大吼012---...he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
对啊   落幕的时候…012---Yeah, and at the end of the play, he...
他还站起来  用力拍打双手012---He got up, you know, and he just started, like, banging his hands together.
好  你们不信就算了012---Okay, fine. Fine. You don't want to believe me, no, that's fine.
