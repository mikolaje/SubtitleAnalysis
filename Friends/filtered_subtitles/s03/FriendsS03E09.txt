这也是你们的感恩节012---Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.
除了看足球  你们还可以帮忙012---You know, instead of watching football, you could help.
我们知道012---We know.
瑞秋  你要将棉花糖排成同心圆012---Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
不  是你要把它们排成同心圆012---No, you want to put them in concentric circles.
我要这么做012---I want to do this.
每年都是这样012---Every year.
《老友记》 第三季 第9集  美式足球比赛012---Friends S03E09 The One with the Football
十码  五码  触地得分  巨人队达阵得分012---To the 10, to the 5. Touchdown, Giants!
我真的想要看一下比赛012---You know, for once, I am gonna try to watch one of these things.
中场休息012---Halftime.
谁要玩一下球012---Who wants to, uh, throw the ball around?
三对三   那应该会很好玩012---Get a little 3-on-3 going? Oh, that would be so much fun!
我能玩吗  我从未玩过足球012---Can I play too?I've never played football, ever.
太棒了  你可以防守钱德012---Great! You can cover Chandler.
我不想玩012---I don't... I don't really want to play.
你跟珍妮丝分手后什么事都没做012---You never do anything since you and Janice broke up.
才不是这样012---Not true.
我想整天穿着睡袍啃花生012---I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.
一早开始喝酒  别说我没有目标012---And start drinking in the morning. Don't say I don't have goals!
你得开始忘了她  好吗012---You have to start getting over her, all right?
玩球或许能让你忘记珍妮丝012---If you play, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.
如果你不玩  大家会生你的气  因为两队人数不一样012---If you don't, everyone will be mad at you because the teams won't be even.
好吧  我玩就是了012---All right, I'll play.
来玩吧  罗斯012---Yay! Yay! Let's do it! Ross?
什么  要玩足球吗012---What? Wanna play football?
嗯...012---Um...
摩妮卡跟我不能玩足球012---Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
谁说的   你们妈妈说的012---Says who? Your mom? Ha-ha-ha.
对 对012---Yes.
以前每年感恩节我们都会玩足球赛012---Ahem. Every Thanksgiving, um, we used to have a touch football game...
它就叫做盖勒杯012---...called The Geller Bowl.
不  你得骄傲地说出来才行012---No, no, no. You say that proudly!
总之我跟罗斯总是当队长012---Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and, um...
竞争很激烈  有一年  第六届盖勒杯012---It got kind of competitive. And one year, Geller Bowl VI...
我不小心打断罗斯的鼻子012---...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.
你是故意的012---It was so not an accident.
她看到我就快抱住她  就用她的…012---She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw...
用她那老奶奶般的粗手臂打我的脸012---...her big fat grandma-arm elbow in my face...
然后拼命往前跑012---...and just kept running.
对了  我达阵得分获得胜利012---To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
哇啊  哦  啊  哦012---Whoa, whoa, whoa! Heh.
你没赢  达阵得分不算012---Uh, you did not win the game. The touchdown didn't count...
因为你犯规了  非常野蛮地打断了我的鼻子012---...because of the spectacularly illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.
我赢了那场比赛012---I won the game.
是吗   为什么你没拿到盖勒杯012---Yeah? Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
还有盖勒杯012---Ahem, there was a Geller Cup?
对  赢的人可以拿到奖杯012---Yes, the trophy you got if you won the game.
但爸说没有人赢   他讨厌我们打架012---But Dad said nobody won, and he was sick of our fighting.
所以他把奖杯拿走012---So he took the trophy...
丢进湖里012---...threw it in the lake.
诅咒破解了吗012---And was the curse lifted?
总之…012---Anyway...
妈说我们再也不准玩足球012---...Mom said we weren't allowed to play football again.
你知道吗   我想我们能打一场比赛012---You know what? I think we should play a game.
少来了  那是十二年前的事012---I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.
我们能谈一谈吗012---Can I see you for a second?
胆小鬼012---Wuss!
好吧  我们要玩012---All right, we're gonna play.
等一下  我们怎么去球场   我妈不让我过街012---Wait. How we gonna get there? My mom won't let me cross the street.
来吧012---Here you go.
好吧012---All right.
开始了  等一下012---Let's bring it in. Wait.
甜心  传给我012---Honey, throw it to me!
接住了012---Here you go. Aah!
你差点打中我的脸012---That almost hit me in the face!
我们得选出队长012---We have to pick captains.
然后挑选队员012---And then "Tennilles."
该怎么选呢012---So how do we decide that?
我们何不跳兔子舞  什么012---Why don't we just bunny up? What?
兔子  兔子012---Bunny!  Bunny!
看起来罗斯跟我是队长012---Looks like Ross and I are captains.
好吧  我先跳的  我能先选  乔伊012---Okay, so, um, I bunnied first, so I get to pick first. Joey.
谢谢  摩妮卡012---Thank you.  Monica.
我是你的好朋友012---I'm your best friend.
甜心  别担心  你会被选中的012---Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.
钱德012---Chandler.
罗斯  菲比012---Ross?  Phoebe.
甜心  我挑你了012---Sweetie, now I pick you.
你才没有挑我  你是没有选择了012---You don't pick me. You're stuck with me!
好吧  就这么办了012---Okay. All right. So let's see.
比赛场地从垃圾桶到灯柱  好吗012---Let's play from the, uh, trash can to the light post, right?
双手达阵得分  比赛开始了012---Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.
各位  听着  我还有28分钟012---People, listen. I've got 28 minutes...
然后我得去帮火鸡涂酱汁012---...before I have to baste again.
就像在参加职业比赛012---Wow, just like in the pros.
好吧  临场会议012---Okay, huddle up! Whoo! Woo-hoo.
到这边开临场会议  等等我012---Huddle up over here! Wait for me! Wait for me!
酷啊  我的第一次临场会012---Oh, cool! My first huddle.
好吧   好吧012---Okay. Ha, ha. Okay.
你们对钱德有什么想法012---So what do you guys really think of Chandler?
你知道你要做什么吧    对012---You know what you're doing, right?  Yeah.
好吧  乔伊接球  我们阻挡012---Okay. Joey will catch it. We'll block.
什么是阻挡012---What's "block"?
我以为你知道你要做什么   我以为你是指在生活中012---I thought you knew what you were doing. I thought you meant in life!
分开012---Break!
球是珍妮丝012---The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
大混蛋012---Ow! Son of a...! Ow!
拜托哦   对不起012---Come on! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
你们知道吗   我们要直接丢球012---You know what? We're just gonna throw it.
我来接012---I got it!

得分  七比零012---Score! Seven to nothing!
甜心  你没事吧012---Honey, you okay?
来吧  我们走012---Come on, let's go.
输家滚开012---Whoo. Losers walk.
是吗   输家只爱放话012---Yeah? Losers talk.
不  你得跟"输家"押韵012---No, no, actually, losers rhyme.
你要直接来   对012---You wanna go shotgun? Yeah.
开球012---Hike.
这边  这里…012---One Mississippi... Over here! Over here! Unh.
我差点接到那一球012---Ha! I almost caught that one!
太棒了  现在比数是七比差点七012---Great. Now the score's seven to almost seven.
好吧  这一球我要你直冲切右012---Okay, on this play, I want you to do a down-and-out to the right, okay?
分开  等一下  我要做什么012---Break! Wait. What am I gonna do?
你呢012---You?
你直接冲012---You go long.
冲到哪里012---How long?
到你几乎看不见我们为止012---Until we start to look very small.
好的  分开  分开012---Okay. Break! Break!
预备  开始012---Set, hike! One Mississippi...
换边  换边012---Switch! Switch! Switch!
不  不012---No, no, no, no!
谢谢你帮我们捡球012---Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.
你们在玩美式足球012---You are playing American football?
对012---Yeah.
你好像是外国人012---Wow, you're, like, from a whole other country!
我是荷兰人   我是乔伊012---I'm Dutch.Hi, I'm Joey.
我是玛哈012---I am Margha.
抱歉  荷兰人  尾音我没听清楚012---Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit. Ha-ha-ha.
你要玩足球或…我是钱德012---You wanna play football or...? Hi, I'm Chandler.
你好  钱德012---Hello, Chandler.
她叫荷兰人跟玛汉012---Her name is Dutch and also "Margham."
玛哈   玛荷012---Margha. Margha.
玛哈012---Margha.
玛汉012---Mahan.
来吧  大伙们  开始了  第二次十码进攻012---Come on, guys! Let's go! Second down!
应该是第三次十码进攻了  才不是  是第二次012---Uh, hello? It's third down.  No, it's not. It's second.
怎么了012---Wow. "Wow" what?
我很讶异你还是会这么做012---It just amazes me that you're still pulling stuff like this. Heh.
什么  本来就是第二次进攻  好吧  第二次012---Pulling what? It's second down. Okay, it's second down.
你说是就是012---Take all the second downs you need.
我听到了  我本来就说得很大声012---I heard that. Well, I said it loud.
我可以在旁边看吗012---It is okay if I stay and watch?
就坐那边吧   对  你何不留下来呢012---Just sit right there. Yeah, why don't you stick around?
一切进行得很顺利   我也那么想012---That went well. I think so.
我想跟她要电话号码012---I was thinking about, uh, asking her for her number.
谢了  兄弟  我自己问的话会比较有诚意012---Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself.
我是想自己追她  为了忘记珍妮丝012---I was thinking about for me, as part of that getting-over-Janice thing.
对  没错012---Oh, yeah. That.
如果这么重要  我就让你追她012---If it means that much, I'll let you have her.
谢谢012---Thanks.
什么   让我追她012---Wh...? "Let me have her"?
你是说你不让我的话  我就毫无机会吗012---You mean if you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot?
我真的不想说出来012---I don't like to say it out loud...
但事实就是如此012---...but yeah!
每个人都有自己的优点  你对数字就比较在行012---We all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
数学   你要跟我提数学的事012---Math? You're giving me math?
好吧  你知道吗  算了012---All right, you know what? Forget about it.
你也能追那个女孩  看谁能追到012---You go for the girl. We'll see who gets her.
钱德  我要你跑向球门左边  甜心012---I want you to run a post-pattern to the left. And, sweetie...
对  我知道  继续跑012---Yeah, I know. Go long.
我只是在人群中前后跑动012---All I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
你想待在那边吗012---Well, uh, you wanna just stay out there?
球能给我一下吗   好的012---Can I see that for a second? Yeah.
好的  好的  开始了012---Okay. Okay, let's go.
我来盯钱德  开始012---I got Chandler   Hike!
一  二  三012---One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi.
掉球012---Fumble!
你有什么毛病   这是我最喜欢的球衣012---What's the matter with you? This is my favorite jersey.
现在你有两件了012---Well, now you have two.
我对数学真的很在行012---Hey, I am good at math!
够了  我还是要让你去追她012---That's it. I was still gonna let you have her.
现在准备好好难过一场吧012---But now, prepare to feel bad about yourself.
我一辈子都在为那个做准备012---I've been preparing for that my entire life!
或是为了你的不礼貌012---Or something about you that's mean!
来吧  各位  开始了012---Come on, guys. Let's go.
追平比数  没时间了012---Tie score. We're running out of time.
42 , 38   开始012---Forty-two, 38, hike!
我来接012---I got it! Ooh! Ugh!
我的咪咪受伤了012---Broken boobs! Ow.
菲比   快跑  跑  菲比012---Pheebs, run! Run, Phoebe! Run!
天啊  没错  达阵得分  达阵得分012---God! Touchdown! Touchdown! Yes! Touchdown! Hey, oh!
不012---No, no, no.
闹钟响了  那一球不算012---Uh, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
在接到球之后  在接到球之前012---After the snap.   Before the snap.
之后  之前012---After. Before.
那很重要吗   对012---Does it really matter? Yes!
但我达阵得分  那是我第一次达阵得分012---But I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown.
菲比  那真的很棒  可惜不算012---Pheebs, that's great. Doesn't count.
那一球算数  作弊鬼  霸道女王012---Does so count. Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
没关系  或许你没长大  但我已经长大了012---That's fine. Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
好吧  去死吧012---Oh, okay. Dead leg!
好吧  你想靠作弊赢球  尽管去吧012---Okay, fine. You want to win by cheating, go ahead.
达阵得分算数  你们赢了012---The touchdown does count. You win.
不012---Whoo! Yay! - No!
我不要再这么做  我要你输得无话可说012---I won't do this again. I wanna beat you when you can't blame it...
鼻子断了  铃声响了  或你可能白血球过多012---...on the broken nose or the buzzer or the fact that you might have mono.
就说双方平手  现在是中场休息012---Let's just call this tie score and it's halftime.
首先我不跟作弊的人比赛012---First, I don't play with cheaters.
其次你知道我的扁桃腺肿了起来012---Second of all, you know I had swollen glands!
你知道吗   我想你会玩的012---You know what? I think you'll play.
真的吗   为什么012---Oh, really? Why's that?
因为赢的人可以拿到这个012---Because the winner gets this.
盖勒杯012---The Geller Cup!
大家都看到  那个钉在木板上的丑娃娃了吗012---Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?
啊哦012---Mm-hm.
好吧  太好了012---Okay, good.
好了  它怎么会在你手上012---Okay, where the hell did you get that?
你到医院去接鼻梁的时候…012---When you went to the hospital for your nose...
我游到湖里把它捞出来的012---...I swam into the lake and fished it out.
奖杯是我的012---That cup is mine!
不  才不是  想要把它带回家  你就得赢球012---No, it's not. You want it, you're gonna have to win it.
我们不吃晚餐了吗012---So are we not having dinner at all?
来吧  开始了  认真点  小组会议012---Come on, let's go. It's time to get serious. Huddle up.
专心在比赛上012---Keep your head in the game.
真的很难  他在那个荷兰女孩旁边开小组会议012---It's hard, you know? His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.
如果我在带球时扑倒钱德  你能专心一点吗012---If I take Chandler out of the running, will you be able to focus?
你打算怎么做   确定让他接到球012---What are you gonna do?  Just make sure he catches the ball.
其他的交给我来办012---I'll do the rest.
来吧  胆小鬼  好了  来吧012---Come on, you wuss! Okay, come on.
快跑  钱德  我来接012---Go, Cha... Chandler. I got it!
加油  这边  快点012---Come on! This way! Come on!
小心012---Look out! - Oof!
哇啊哦012---Whoa, whoa.
被女生擒抱  这种画面不多见吧012---Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't see that every day.
你这是干嘛012---Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's with the tackling?
干嘛012---What?
我碰他一下  他就倒下来了012---I just touched him and he went over.
好吧  你要来硬的吗  我们也可以来硬的012---Okay. You wanna play rough? We can play rough.
准备跳伦巴吧012---Let's get ready to rumble!
快点   抓住她012---Go, go, go! Get her! Get her!
我喜欢这种运动012---I love this game!
你怎么会有那个012---Where'd you get that?
我跑的好远012---I went really long.
42比21012---Forty-two to 21.
跟火鸡一样  罗斯输了012---Like the turkey, Ross is done!
你先挑队员  所以你那队的实力比较好012---You got to pick first, so you got the better team.
太可悲了  你不肯承认我们赢球012---Pathetic! Why can't you just accept that we're winning...
因为我比你厉害012---...because I'm better than you?
说得太有道理了  好一声叹息012---Pfft!  Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!
好吧  我要让你心服口服012---All right, I'll prove it to you. Okay?
我用乔伊跟你换瑞秋  我还是能赢012---I'll trade you Joey for Rachel and I'll still win the game.
什么  男生对女生012---What? The guys against the girls?
太可笑了  我只落后三记达阵得分012---That's ridiculous because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
那就得分给我看啊012---Oh, then bring it on!
除非你害怕会输给几个女生012---Unless you're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
好吧  瑞秋  你到摩妮卡那边  乔伊  你跟我一队012---Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica. Joey, you're with me.
你竟然把我交换出去012---I can not believe you're trading me.
我们也来尝尝看赢球的滋味012---Let's see what it's like to be on a winning team for a change.
你会让我摸球吗012---You're gonna let me play?
那么好吧012---All right, then!
比赛结束了吗  我们要吃饭了吗012---The game is over? We eat now?
不  比赛还没有结束  我们在交换队友012---No, the game's not over. We're switching teams.
钱德发现我太厉害了  还是跟他同一队比较好012---Chandler finds me so intimidating that it's better if we're on the same team.
好吧  开始了012---Okay, let's play. Let's go.
等一下012---Oh, uh, hold on a second.
荷兰人是从哪里来的012---Ahem. Where do Dutch people come from?
那个嘛…012---Uh, well, the, uh...
宾州荷兰人来自宾州012---...Pennsylvania Dutch come from Pennsylvania.
其他荷兰人呢012---And the, uh, other Dutch people?
他们来自荷兰  对吧012---They come from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
少唬人了012---Nice try.
荷兰是虚构的地方012---The Netherlands is this make-believe place...
彼得潘跟小仙女住在那里012---...where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
天啊012---Oh, my.
疯狂地理课结束了  开始打球吧012---Enough "geography for the insane." Let's play ball.
不  我不要跟这家伙同队012---No. No, I'm not playing with this guy.
我没意见  我受够了012---Oh, fine with me. I've had enough of this.
我们就废话少说了  海蒂  你喜欢我的哪个朋友012---Let's just cut to the chase. Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
你在做什么   你在做什么012---What are you doing? What are you doing? Shh, shh.
我喜欢哪一个012---Which do I like?
对  约会  打打闹闹  带他回你的风车012---Yeah, for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill?
如果一定要现在选…012---Well, if I had to choose right now...
对了  我也觉得不可思议…012---...which, by the way, I find really weird...
不过我会选钱德012---...I would have to say Chandler.
太棒了012---Yes!
等一下  她显然没听懂你的问题012---Wait a minute. She didn't understand the question.
为什么你不请虎克船长  跟他解释一下012---Why don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her?
抱歉  那是我的真心话012---I'm sorry. That is my truth.
你听到了吗   那是她的真心话 "我让你追她"先生012---You hear that? That is her truth, Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her"!
我赢了  你输了  我是最棒的012---I win! You suck! I rule all!
帮我跳迷你波浪舞庆祝一下012---Mini-wave in celebration of me!
我想我的答案要改成  "我谁都不要选"012---I am now thinking I would like to change my answer to "no one."
什么012---What?
我发现你很肤浅012---I now find you shallow, and, um...
是个呆瓜012---...a dork.
再见012---Bye-bye.
干得好012---Heh. Nice going.
你害自己几个月没有性生活012---You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
那不重要   因为她选了我012---It doesn't matter, because she picked me.
从现在开始   我可以去约会012---From now on, I get the dates...
星期六晚上  你只能待在家里看烹饪节目012---...and you stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
别说了  时间急迫012---Save the breakthroughs for therapy. The clock is ticking.
我们没时间了  我们输给女生012---We have no time, and we are losing to girls.
我们不会输给女生012---We're not gonna lose to girls.
现在比数是42比21012---It's 42-21!
该死  刚刚我还赢那么多012---This sucks! I was just up by that much!
我们到底要不要比赛  来吧  你们这些娘娘腔012---Are we playing football or what? Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!
我们非赢不可  我们为全世界的女人而战012---We have to do this. We're playing for women everywhere.
想像你们的每一次烂约会012---Think about every lousy date you ever had.
