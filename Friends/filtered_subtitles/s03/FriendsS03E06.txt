摩妮卡  我有一个月的时间  睡不着觉012---Monica, do you know I couldn't sleep for a month...
就因为我在沙发垫上  滴了一滴墨水012---...because I got a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions?
你可以把抱枕翻面啊012---You could've just turned the cushion over.
本来会的  但是另外一边  沾到意大利面酱汁012---I would have, but I had a spaghetti stain on the other side.

我也爱你  好012---I love you too. Good.
怎么了012---What?
怎么了  我只是难过而已012---What? I'm just sad.

菲比搬出去了012---Phoebe moved out.
对喔012---Right.
我不懂012---I don't understand.
跟我住那么困难吗   这是我没有男友的原因吗012---Am I so hard to live with? Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
不…012---No...
你没有男友是因为…012---You don't have a boyfriend because...
我不知道为什么  你没有男友012---I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.
你应该要有的012---You should have a boyfriend.

我想我的婚姻…012---I think my marriage...
应该是完蛋了012---...is kind of over.
不会吧  怎么了012---Oh, no! Why?
因为卡萝是女同志012---Because Carol's a lesbian.
而我不是女同志012---And I'm not one.
而且这显然不是一时激情012---And apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
我不敢相信012---I don't believe it!
可怜的孩子012---Oh, you poor bunny.
我是个白痴012---I'm an idiot.

卡萝和我出门时  她如果看到漂亮的女生…012---I mean, Carol and I would be out, and she'd see some beautiful woman...
就会说 "罗斯  你快看"012---...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"
我还觉得…012---And I'd think
"天啊  我老婆太酷了"012---"God, my wife is cool." Heh.
嘿  你觉得那个苏珊  是她的情人吗012---Aw. Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?

这一切或许就不会发生了012---...or I'd paid more attention...
有子宫也行012---...or I had a uterus.
我不敢相信  我知道012---I can't believe it. I know.
你不该受这种折磨  真的  罗斯012---You know, you don't deserve this. You don't, Ross.
你真的很棒  谢谢012---You're so good. Thanks.

等等  我的脚卡在球袋里012---Wait, wait, wait! My foot is stuck in the pocket.
怎么了  我拿不出来012---What? I can't get it out.
女生可不想听到这个012---That's not something a girl wants to hear.
别提这个012---Come on, don't start.
又怎么了012---Ow! What?
