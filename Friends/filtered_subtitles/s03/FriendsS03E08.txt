拿去吧  菲比012---Here you go, Pheebs.
谁要吃我的特殊自制布朗尼蛋糕012---Who wants one of my special home-baked brownies?
我要吃一块012---I'll have one.
啊012---Agh! Ugh.
没关系  我不吃了012---That's okay.  I'm not having one.
不  我是牙齿痛012---No, no. It's just my tooth.
好吧   我要吃一块012---All right. I'll have one.
你需要牙医吗   我的牙医很不错012---So you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
谢谢  我的牙医也很不错  但我没办法去看他012---Thanks. I have a good one too. I just can't see him.
看吧   那就是隐形牙医的问题012---See, that is the problem with invisible dentists.
为什么你不能去看他012---Why can't you go to him?
因为每次我去看牙医   都会有人死掉012---Because every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
真诡异  因为每次我去看牙医012---That's so weird. Every time I go to the dentist...
我都会看助理的胸部012---...I look down the hygienist's blouse.
菲比  你说…012---Phoebe, what, um?
什么012---What?

然后是我的邮差约翰012---And then there was, um, John, my mailman.
我的牛仔朋友艾比诺巴伯012---And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.
这些人真的死了012---Ahem. And all these people actually died?
对  我去看牙医的时候012---Yes. While I was in the chair.
所以我都自己保健牙齿  不是为了口腔卫生012---That's why I take care of my teeth. It's not about oral hygiene.
我用牙线是为了救人012---I floss to save lives.
少来了  你没有杀人012---Come on, you didn't kill anybody.
这些人只是刚好  在你去看牙医时死掉了012---These people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
那是个巧合012---It's just a coincidence.
去跟他们说吧  不行  他们死了012---Tell that to them. Oh, you can't! They're dead!

钱德在吗012---Hey, is Chandler here?
不  他不在012---No. No, he's not.

什么012---Huh? Oh! What?
你打算怎么办   你怎么跟钱德说012---What are you gonna do? How are you gonna tell Chandler?
我一直在想这件事  最好的办法就是…012---I was thinking about that. I think the best way would be...
…不要说012---...to not.
乔伊  你知道这件事  就一定要告诉他012---Joey, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
这会要了他的命012---It'll kill him. It'll just kill him.
等我去看牙医后再说吧   或许会先要了他的命012---Wait till I go to the dentist. Maybe I'll kill him.
哇012---Ew!
丑八怪裸男躺在吊床上  好像猪肉工厂喔012---Ugly Naked Guy's using a hammock. It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.
我要去看牙医  听我说012---I'm going to the dentist. So listen...
小心别跌倒了012---...just be on the lookout for anything that you could fall into...
或是被掉下来的东西砸到012---...or that can fall on you...
或是…012---...or...
好吧  总之要小心012---All right, just look out!
好吗   我只是想…012---Okay? And, um, I also just want to...
我只是想告诉大家…012---I just want to tell you all that, um...

有一些小孩大闹智人展览 （与同性恋同字）012---Some kids messed up the Homo sapien display.
怎么个闹法012---What did they do?
他们把招牌上的"智"字涂掉了012---They painted over the word "sapien," for one thing.
还把人偶重新排列  这个就不说了012---Then they rearranged the figures. Let's just leave it at that.
要我帮你照顾小班吗012---Do you want me to watch Ben for you?
对  我正想问你  谢谢012---Yes, that's what I was gonna ask. Thank you.

太好了  我拜托摩妮卡是因为…012---That would be great! I just asked Monica...

罗斯  我要问你一个科学问题   对012---Hey, Ross? I got a science question. Yeah. Mm-hm.
如果智人真的是同性恋012---If the Homo sapiens were, in fact, "homo" sapiens...
所以才会绝种吗012---...is that why they're extinct?
乔伊  智人就是人012---Joey, Homo sapiens are people.
我不是在批评他们012---Hey, I'm not judging.

好吧  我喜欢那样  好吧012---All right, I like that. Okay.
没事了  对吧012---So we're okay. We're okay, aren't we?
不  问题大了  这里肿起来了012---No, we're not okay. There's a bump.
头肿了  在哪里012---There's a bump. What bump?
天啊  把它压回去012---Oh, my God! Well, push it in! Push it in!
我没办法把它压回去012---I can not push it in!

我们可以帮他戴帽子012---...we could put a hat on his head.
帽子  没错  我们需要帽子  我们去哪里找顶小帽子012---A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

它知道该怎么做012---Because he'll know what to do?
天啊  你是个天才012---Oh, my God. You're a genius!
天啊  帽子缝死了012---Oh, God. It's kind of sewn on.
快给我   好吧012---Give it. Give it. Okay.
今天就跟一场血战一样012---Agh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today!
等一下  等一下012---Hey, hold on a second. Hold on a second.
你觉得这条珍珠项链漂亮吗012---Do you think these pearls are nice?
我比较喜欢登山车012---I'd prefer a mountain bike.
珍妮丝的生日快到了  我要送她一样特别的礼物012---Janice's birthday's coming. I wanna get her something special.
跟我一起进去  等一下012---Come in here with me. Woah, woah, whoa, wait. Woah.
你要送她特别的礼物   送她花012---You wanna get her something special? Get her flowers.
送她糖果  送她口香糖  女生喜欢口香糖012---Get her candy. Get her gum. Girls love gum.
好主意  亲爱的珍妮丝  祝你生日快乐得冒泡012---That's a good idea. "Dear Janice: Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday."
我要送她认真一点的礼物012---I'd like to get her something serious.
你要认真一点的礼物012---Oh, you want something serious.
你知道吗   你该送她…012---You know what you should do? You should get her one of those, um...
灌肠剂012---...barium enemas.
那保证认真012---Those are dead serious.
听着  我要进去了   千万别买礼物送我012---Look, I'm gonna go in here. And you don't buy me anything, ever!
你不能送她珍珠项链012---You can't! You can't. You can't buy her pearls.
你就是不能那么做012---You just can't, you can't, you can't!
为什么不能012---Why not?
天啊  好吧012---Oh, God. Uh, okay.
事情是这样的012---Here's the thing. Ahem.
事情是这样的  好吧  问题是…012---This is the thing. Okay, the thing is...
到底怎么了   好吧012---What is the thing? Okay.
我在床垫大王卖场012---I went down to the Mattress King's showroom...
看到珍妮丝吻她的前夫012---...and I saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
什么012---What?
他们在他的办公室里012---They were in his office.
她不会那么做  她跟我在一起012---Well, she... She wouldn't do that. She's with me.
我跟你说真的  我看到了012---I'm telling you, I saw it.
你看错了  好吗012---Well, you're wrong. Okay? You're wrong.
我没看错012---I'm not wrong.
我也希望我看错了012---I wish I was.
很遗憾012---I'm sorry.
现在觉得送灌肠剂不错吧012---Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
整套穿上比较逼真  他也不会注意到帽子的部份012---It makes more sense as an ensemble. And it takes the focus off the hat.
你们还活着012---Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
看吧  我保证过  不会有人死掉  对吧012---See? I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
待会就知道了  借我打电话给我认识的人012---We'll see about that. Can I use your phone to call everyone I know?
当然  我们没有钱  请便012---Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.
你没事  好吧  再见012---Hey, you're not dead! Okay, see you.
摩妮卡012---Monica.
天啊  他会说我的名字012---Oh, my God! He just said my name!
你听到了吗   对012---Did you hear that? Yeah.
摩妮卡撞到了012---Monica bang!
好吧  我听到了012---Ahem. Okay, I heard that.
他说 "摩妮卡撞到了"012---Did he just say, "Monica bang"? Mm-hm.
天啊  他要告我的密012---Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!
摩妮卡撞到了012---Monica bang! Oh, ho, ho.
甜心  你不能再那么说012---Sweetie, you need to stop saying that now.
那没什么大不了的  根本不值得到一提012---It's no big deal. It's not even worth mentioning.
看吧  我们经常撞来撞去012---You see? We all do it all the time.
看到了吗  看我的012---See? Watch this.
小班012---Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow.
摩妮卡撞到了  大家撞到了012---Monica bang! Everybody bang!
班撞到了012---Ben bang!
瑞秋撞到了012---Rachel bang!
撞  瑞秋  撞012---Bang, Rachel! Bang!
很好玩吧   看我的012---Oh, isn't it fun? Look at that! Look at that!
我们都会那么做012---We all do it!
好吧  我不再撞了  你没事吧012---Okay, I'm stopping now. Are you okay?
对  如果不是撞床头板  真的不值012---Oh, yeah. You know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
我的小宝贝还好吧012---How's my Bing-a-ling?
啊012---Uh...
我不知道012---I don't know.
你来告诉我吧012---You tell me.
你有事要跟我说吗012---Anything you, uh, want to tell me?
因为如果你…你该…012---Because if you, uh... You should...
你会告诉我的012---You would tell me.
你干嘛睁大了眼睛012---Why are your eyes so wide?
你来告诉我吧012---You tell me.
或许那是因为我跟我前女友胡来012---Maybe it's because I was just fooling around with my ex.
不  是你跟前夫胡来012---Oh, no. No, no, no. That was you!
天啊012---Oh, my God!
好吧   你怎么知道012---All right! How did you know?
乔伊跟我说的  他看到你们两个在接吻012---Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.
在公园里012---In the park?
不  他的办公室里  你们接吻过几次012---No. In his office. How many kisses were there?
只有那两次  为什么012---Just those two! Wh...? Why? Why?
为什么你们要接吻   你们不该接吻的012---Why was there kissing? There should be no kissing!
对不起  甜心  我真的…012---Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I'm so, so...
我真的很抱歉  我是…012---I'm so, so sorry. I just...
事实是我…我喘不过气来012---What happened was I... I can't breathe.
你能帮我拿个袋子过来吗012---Can you get me a bag or something? Aah.
拿去012---Here. Here. Aah.
好了012---There.
这是收据  我来处理012---It's the receipt. I'll take it.
听着  我得知道012---Look, I've got to know.
你要跟我分手吗012---Are you finished with me?
你要跟他分手吗012---Are you finished with him?
你还爱他012---Do you still love him?
你还爱我012---Do you still love me?
好吧  听着012---All right, look...
我要真的答案  好吗012---...I'm gonna need an actual answer here, okay?
到底你要哪一个012---So which is it?
他或我012---Him or me?
我不知道012---I don't know.
好吧  如果你还活着  你该接电话的012---Okay, if you're alive, you answer your phone!
小班  我不会跟你爸说  你在晚餐前吃冰淇淋012---Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream before dinner...
只要你不跟他说  撞到头的小意外012---...if you won't tell him about our little bonking incident.
第一   我想小班不了解贿赂的概念012---Number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery.
第二  我…012---And number two, I...
什么012---What?
你说 "第二"012---You said "number two."
我还说了 "第一"012---I also said "number one."
我知道012---Ha-ha-ha, I know.
大家好012---Hey, everyone! Hi!
我儿子还好吗012---How's my little boy?
他好得很  对吧  小班012---He's perfect. Aren't you, Ben?
他再好不过了  你们做了什么   带他去捕鲸吗012---He's never been better. What did you do, take him whaling?
摩妮卡012---Monica.
天啊  他会叫你的名字 太棒了  做得好  小班012---Oh, my God! He just said your name! That's great! Good job, Ben!
摩妮卡撞到了012---Monica bang!
没错012---Ha-ha-ha. That's right.
那就是我爆炸的声音012---That's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
诅咒解除了 我联络了所有认识的人012---Woo-hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know...
大家都活着012---...and everyone is alive!
什么012---Huh. What?
丑八怪裸男一动都不动012---Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
天啊  我又杀人了012---Oh, my God, I killed another one!
诅咒越来越强  连那么胖的人都会死012---The curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
或许他只是在睡午觉012---Maybe he's just taking a nap.
我得说他从今天早上开始  就一动都不动的012---I'm telling you, he hasn't moved since this morning.
或许我们该报警012---We should call somebody.
跟他们说我们偷窥的裸男  一动都不动012---Tell them the naked guy we stare at isn't moving?
我们得知道他是不是还活着012---We've got to find out if he's alive.
我们该怎么办   那是不可能的012---How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
有个办法012---Well, there is one way.
他的窗户没关  我是说…012---His window's open. I say...
我们可以戳戳他012---...we poke him.
嘿012---Hey!
我们吃中国菜时012---You know how we, uh, save all those chopsticks...
不是会把筷子留下来吗012---...for no reason when we get Chinese food?
怎么了012---Yeah?
现在能派上用场了012---Well, now we got a reason.
什么012---What?
我们要做非常长的戳人棒012---Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
好吧012---All right.
怎么了012---Hey, uh, what's the matter?
我跟珍妮丝谈过012---I talked to Janice.
天啊  她要跟他复合吗012---Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?
她不知道012---She doesn't know.
她说她爱我们两个012---Says she loves us both.
今天早上醒来时我沉溺在爱河里012---I woke up this morning, I was in love.
我很幸福012---I was happy!
所以我去买了12包保险套012---It serves me right for buying that 12-pack of condoms.
现在我没办法退货  因为她把收据吞下去了012---And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the receipt!
你打算怎么办012---What are you, uh...? What are you gonna do?
我不知道012---I don't know.
你会怎么做呢012---You know? What would you do?
我会怎么做并不重要012---Uh, it doesn't matter what I'd do.
来吧  快告诉我012---Come on. Come on. Tell me.
好吧  你…012---All right, you, uh...
或许你不想听  可是…012---...you probably won't want to hear this, but, uh...
换作是我  这是我的做法  我会…012---...if it was me, and this is just me, I would, uh...
我会自己闪人  什么012---I would bow out. What?
你在胡说什么012---What are you talking about?
他们有个孩子012---They have a kid together...
你知道吗   他们是…012---...you know? They're like...
他们是一家人012---They're, like, a family.
如果…我不知道012---And if, I don't know...
如果他们有机会复合012---...if there's a chance they can make that work...
我不想变成破坏他们家庭的人012---...I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way.
你没事吧012---You okay?
你…012---You, uh?
你要去戳裸男吗012---You wanna come poke a nude guy?
他终于睡着了012---Well, he's finally asleep. Mm.
他的头肿了起来012---About that, uh, bump on his head...
你确定那是新伤口吗012---Are you, uh, sure it's a new bump?
我没有恶意  但我一直觉得他满头是包012---No offense, but I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.
撞到头也没关系  小孩子经常撞到头012---It's okay if he bumps his head. Kids bump their heads all the time.
这是你第一次当褓姆  你尽力了012---It was your first time babysitting. You did your best.
我尽力了  我知道012---I did! I know.
不过你得随时盯着012---You just have to watch them all the time.
我有啊  我有看着他012---I did! I watched! I watched!
我看到摩妮卡撞到他的头012---I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
那是摩妮卡撞的012---Monica did it?
摩妮卡   什么012---Monica? Um... Yeah.
你有没有发现  班今天怪怪的012---Did you notice anything weird about Ben today?
没有啊  怎么了012---No, why?
我跟他玩  我们在唱字母歌012---I was just playing with him, and we were doing the "Alphabet Song"...
那是他的拿手歌曲  但他忘了唱E跟F012---...which he's good at. But he left out "E" and "F."
就像是…我不知道  他完全忘得精光012---It's like they just, uh, I don't know, fell out of his head.
真的吗012---Really?
还有他走路的样子012---Oh, and also, he's walking...
有点怪怪的012---...kind of funny.
他的左脚比右脚迈步快012---It's like his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg.
对  他在房里会这么做012---Yeah, he's in there, just sort of, you know...
天啊  我把你儿子弄坏了012---Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!
希望你下了地狱  还会觉得好玩012---I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
你这个混蛋012---You jerk!
你知道我爱那个孩子  摩妮卡撞到了012---You know I love that kid! Monica bang! Monica bang!
我去拿帽子012---I'll get the hat.
珍妮丝  我有事要跟你说012---I have something to tell you.
我要你听我说完012---And I want you to let me get through it...
因为…012---...because...
要说出口并不容易012---...it's not gonna be easy.
好的012---Okay.
我想你该跟盖瑞复合012---I think you should go back with Gary.
我不想拆散你们一家人012---I don't want to be the guy that breaks up a family.
我爸妈因为那个男人分手012---You know, when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
每次见到他  我都会想012---Whenever I'd see him, I'd always think:
就是你害的  你让他们无法在一起012---"You're the reason. You are why they're not together."
我恨那个男人012---And I hated that guy.
不论他人多好  他让我爸多么开心012---And it didn't matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad.
没错012---Yeah, wow.
这么做才是对的012---It's the right thing to do.  Ugh.
