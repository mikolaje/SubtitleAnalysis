要是我们的鸡和鸭生小宝宝不是很有趣吗012---Hey, wouldn't it be cool if our duck and our chick had a little baby?
可以叫他查克012---We could call it Chuck.

嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿  我要请你们帮忙012---Listen, I need a favor.
我刚才在洗澡  正在…012---I was in the shower, and as I was...
冲洗时  我感觉到点东西012---...cleansing myself, I, uh... Well, I felt something.
很像打喷嚏  但是感觉更爽012---Was it like a sneeze, only better?
不是  是我身上长了东西012---No, no. I mean, like, a thing on my body.
什么东西012---Well, what was it?
不知道  它长在我不能…012---Well, I don't know. It's kind of in a place that's not...
我看不到  我想麻烦你们…012---It's not visually accessible to me. And I was hoping maybe you guys...
帮我看-下012---...could help me out.
不要012---Whoa! Whoa! No.

嘿．． 嘿．．012---Hey, hey, hey.
是什么是痣吗012---Well, what is it? Is it a mole?
不是  太皱了  不是痣012---No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
那是青春痘吗012---Ew. Is it...? What, a pimple?
不是  它…012---No, it's...
比青春痘更高档012---...fancier than a pimple.
你就去看医… 你们在干……012---Look, Ross, just go see a doc... Guys, what's...?
确定了  冬天还有两星期012---Okay, well, it's definite. Two more weeks of winter.

嗨012---Hi.
嘿  文斯是消防员012---Hey. Vince is a fireman.
你从燃烧的大楼里救过人吗012---Wow. Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
九十八次  队里第一012---Ninety-eight hot saves. Highest on the force.
要是乔伊和我玩火柴012---Well, you know, if Joey and I play with matches...
就可以让你累积到一百次012---...we could get you up to an even 100.
孩子  不能拿火灾开玩笑012---Fire safety is not a joke, son. Ha, ha. Oh.
你说得对  我知道012---You're right. I know.
我要走了  晚上要值班012---Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.
星期六见  好012---See you Saturday. Okay.
菲比  他好可爱012---Wow, he's cute, Pheebs.
但你不是刚和那个幼稚园老师开始交往了吗012---But I thought you just started dating that teacher.
杰森  是啊012---Oh, Jason? Yeah.
我们晚上要见面012---Uh-huh. We're seeing each other tonight. Ahem.
菲比012---Well, Pheebs?
脚踏两条船  你不像这种人012---Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
我知道  我只是喜欢拈花惹草而已012---I know, I know. I'm, like, playing the field, you know?
我在玩弄别人  三心二意012---I'm juggling two guys. I'm sowing my wild oats, you know?
我是三心二意的花心大萝卜012---You know, this kind of, like, you know, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.
他们知道对方的存在吗012---So, Pheebs, do they know about each other?
狗狗念书时   嘴唇会动吗012---Does a dog's lips move when he reads?
他们不知道012---Okay, no, they don't know.
各位  嘿012---Hey, guys. Hi.
怎样  医生怎么说012---Well? How'd it go at the doctor's?
他说不用担心  是良性的012---Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about. It's totally benign.
是什么  他根本说不出来012---Well, what is it? He couldn't even tell me.
他只说是一种皮肤异常012---He said it was just some sort of skin abnormality.
更糟的是  他说  由于无法辨认012---And the worse thing is, he said not being able to identify it...
他不愿意为我切除012---...he was reluctant to remove it.
你应该去找我的医生012---You know what? You should go to my guy.
我带着第三个乳头去找他时…012---Because when I went in there with my third nipple...
他直接就把它给切了  是啊012---...he just lopped it right off, you know? Yeah?
我还蛮幸运的012---So I guess I'm lucky. Heh.
虽然比不上天生只有两个乳头的人012---I mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.
至少他们知道你长了什么  你的有名字012---At least they knew what yours was. You know? Yours had a name.
也许医学界会以你为名012---Oh. Maybe they'll name yours after you.
把它叫做罗斯012---You know? They'd call it The Ross.
大家会说 "噢  他长了一个罗斯"012---And then people would be, like, "Oh, he's got a Ross."
是啊  真酷012---Yeah, that'd be cool.
彼特要跟我分手012---Pete's breaking up with me.
什么012---What?
我刚才听留言012---Yeah, I just checked my messages.
等他从亚特兰大回来  "我们得谈一谈"012---He said that when he gets back from Atlanta, "We need to talk."
然后呢  就这样012---And? Well, that's it.
没有人会说我们得谈一谈   除非是坏事012---People never say, "We need to talk," unless it's something bad.
那不一定代表他要跟你分手012---Whoa. That doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.
是啊  真的012---Yeah. Really?
也许他只是劈腿012---Yeah. Maybe he just cheated on you.
这么做不会让我变富裕  但我还是很高兴012---And I know I'll never get rich doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool...
我正在改变一个孩子的人生012---...knowing you're making a difference in a kid's life.
真好012---That is so great.
天哪012---Oh, my God. Oh.
天哪012---Oh, my God! Ooh.
赶快通知消防队  不012---Uh, we'd better call the fire department. No. No.
不  不必找消防员吧012---No, no? Well, we don't need a fireman.
应该找好的技工来012---We need, like, a good mechanic.
他们来了  快走012---Oh, my God. Here they come. We gotta get out of here.
等一下  为什么012---Wait. Why?
要是我想看消防员  我会找消防员约会  好吗012---Look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one, okay?
只是一个多出来的乳头012---That's all it is, a third nipple.
很普通的第三个乳头012---You know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Yeah.
你可以把它切掉   直接切掉012---You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off.
把上衣脱掉让我看一下012---Take your shirt off and let's see what we're dealing with here.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
让你看那个非常普通  可以直接切掉的乳头012---Just showing you my run-of-the-mill, slice-it-right-off third nipple.
这不是第三个乳头012---Well, that's not a third nipple. Oh?
首先  它长在你的屁股上012---First of all, it's on your ass.
不然是什么012---Well, then what is it?
等一下012---Wait a minute. Hold it.
詹森  麻烦来一下  我在跟汉弥顿讲话012---Jansen, will you come in here a moment? JANSEN: I'm with Hamilton.
他对怪东西很在行  叫他也来012---He's good with weird things. Bring him in too.
我得去帮彼特浇花012---I gotta go water Pete's plants.
你们知道吗  如果他想分手  我就不浇了012---You know what? If he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
如果他要分手  干脆让乔伊和我去浇012---Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants...
懂我的意思吧012---...if you know what I mean.
又或者… 我们可以对着花盆撒尿012---Or, ha, ha......we could go over there and pee on them.
我受不了了012---I can't take it, you know?
我怕会被捉到012---I'm always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other.
我快疯了012---It's making me crazy.
那为什么不跟其中一个分手012---Well, honey, why don't you break up with one of them?
你不是在拈花惹草吗012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened to playing the field?
现在不好玩了012---Well, it doesn't feel like playing anymore.
比较像工作  很累人012---It's feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
那就选一个  对啊  你比较喜欢哪一个012---So, Pheebs, pick one of them. Yeah, which one do you like more?
文斯很棒  他是男人中的男人012---Well, Vince is great, you know? Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.
他好壮  真的好壮012---You know? He's just so burly, so very burly.
好  那就选文斯吧012---Okay, good. So there you go. Go with Vince.
但是杰森好感性012---Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
感性很重要  选他012---Well, sensitive is important. Pick him. Yeah.
是啊  听娘娘腔的话012---Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.
杰森才不娘娘腔012---Jason is not a sissy.
不是啦  我是说钱德012---Oh, no, no, no. I meant Chandler.
我晚上有约012---You know, I have dinner plans.
谢谢各位临时赶来012---Thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.
各位先生  女士  我行医二十三年012---Ladies and gentlemen, I've been practicing medicine for 23 years...
现在却被难倒了012---...and I'm stumped.
这里是书房012---Okay, this is the den.
你们看  灯光…012---All right, check this out. Lights.
少一点光…不好的光012---Whoa. All right, less lights. Bad lights.
灯光移开012---Lights, go away.
看到了吗  下对指令就行了012---Aw, see? You just need to find the right command.
也可以用调的012---Yes. And the dimmer switch.
他那么有钱   电视还真小012---Whoa. For a rich guy, that's a pretty small TV.
那是视讯电话012---No, no, no. That's the videophone.
你们根本不该在这里的  所以不要乱碰东西012---But hey, guys, you're not supposed to be here, so please don't touch anything.
宜家家居  好舒服012---IKEA, this is comfortable.
这里太高级了012---This place is amazing.
那个厨房是我见过最赞的  我知道012---Oh, God. That is the nicest kitchen. I know.
我是说真的012---No, no. It's the nicest kitchen.
冰箱还会祝我今天愉快012---The refrigerator told me to have a great day.
你们看   百万富翁的支票簿012---Look at this, a millionaire's checkbook.
乔伊  把那个放下012---Joey, put that down.
天哪  是彼特  快出去012---Oh, my God, that's Pete. Okay, get out.
视讯电话要怎么接  摩妮卡012---How the hell do you answer a videophone? Monica?
原来是这样012---I guess that's how.
摩妮卡  你好吗012---Hey, Monica, how's it going?
呃…很好012---Oh, it's good. It's, um... It's good.

彼特…012---Uh, Pete, um...
那天你说要找我谈一谈012---The other day when you said you needed to talk...
请问是好消息还是坏消息012---...um, just so I know, is it good news or bad news?
好消息  绝对是好消息012---Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news.
等一下  有另一个电话012---Hold on a second, I have another call.
你好吗012---Hey, how's it going?
还是我012---No, no, no, it's still me.

我们也爱你012---We love you too.

主题可以是…012---And the theme could be:
"看我们多有钱啊"012---"Look How Much Money We've Got."
你可以在喜帖里放钱012---You know? I mean, you could put money in the invitations.
你可以用钱做成餐具012---You could have, like, little-money place settings.
第一道菜可以上钞票沙拉012---And, uh, you could start with a money salad.
虽然干了点  但绝对受欢迎012---I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.
别再说了012---Would you stop?
我们才交往两星期  也不知道他会不会求婚012---We've only gone out a couple of weeks. We don't know if he'll propose.
他是彼特   跟别人不一样012---Yes, but this is Pete, okay? He's not like other people.
你们第一次约会就去了罗马012---On your first date, he took you to Rome.
对其他男人来说  那是第三 四次约会的事012---For most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.

长期来说  感性应该比…012---And in the long run, I think sensitive is better than having...
这么  这么性感的身材来得好012---...just, like, a really, really, really nice body.
杰森   绝对是杰森012---Jason. Definitely Jason.
祝我好运吧  祝好运012---Wish me luck.Good luck.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
抱歉   我在想像接到钞票抛花的感觉012---Sorry. I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
抱歉  文斯在吗012---Excuse me. Um, is Vince here?
在012---Oh, sure.
文斯  来了012---Vince. Yo.

什么事012---So, what's up?
这件事很难说出口012---This isn't gonna be easy. Um...
我们还是别再见面了012---I don't think we should see each other anymore.
很好012---Good deal.
对不起   没关系012---I'm sorry. No, it's okay.
我还以为我们之间很特别012---It's just that, uh, I thought we had something pretty special here.
我以为终于找到了可以倾诉的对象012---An you know, I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to.
我还有好多事没跟你分享012---There's so much in me I haven't shared with you yet.
天哪  我不知道你… 抱歉  我说不出话来了012---Oh, my God. I didn't know you were so... I'm sorry. I can't talk.
我要去写日记012---I'm gonna go write in my journal.
等一下012---Wait. Wait. Wait.
我说了  你如果想解决那个问题  就去找我的药草师012---I'm telling you, if you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.
谢了  我是想切除  不是想做成香料012---Thank you, but I wanna remove it, Pheebs. I don't wanna make it savory.
当女生与长了怪东西的男人睡过之后012---You know, when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body...
都会跟朋友讲012---...they tell their friends about it.
拿来012---Give me that.
别生我的气  但我就是忍不住012---Hi. Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
新娘杂志012---Bride's magazines?
我知道你不会答应求婚012---Yes, and I know that you said you'd say no if he asked you...
但是穿这套唐娜凯伦走红毯012---...but I'm sorry, how great would you look walking down the aisle...
该有多美啊012---...in this Donna Karan?
一定会很美012---Oh, you so would.
不结婚也要买012---Oh, you should get that anyway.
可以穿去夜店012---Well, for clubbing.
真的很奇怪…012---It is so weird.
我说过不会答应  但是今天早上…012---I know what I said. But, um, this morning...
我躺在床上想像说愿意的感觉012---...I was lying in bed, I was imagining what it'd be like to say yes.
我知道有点突然  也很匆促012---I know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed...
我也不是会做这种事的人012---...and it's totally not like me to do something like this.
但这不意味着  我不能做  对吧012---But that doesn't mean I can't. Right?
毕竟我那么爱彼特012---I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.
我们追求同样的东西012---And I know that we want the same things.
当我想到说愿意的感觉…012---And when I thought about saying yes...
让我觉得很快乐012---...it made me really happy.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我知道012---I know.
我需要更多派012---I need more pie.
要是你真的结婚   我可以带两个人去吗012---Hey, Mon, um, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
你没跟消防员分手012---You didn't break up with that fireman?
没有  我的话  就是这个意思012---No, that was my way of telling you.
其实他非常感性012---Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.
他写日记  还画画012---He keeps a journal and he paints.
他还为我画了一幅炭笔画012---He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
他想用水彩画  但是他很容易搞到黑炭012---He'd prefer watercolors, but, you know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
那你要甩掉杰森吗012---So then are you gonna dump Jason?
对  我总得跟其中一个分手012---Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone and...
杰森很感性  但文斯也是012---Okay, so Jason is sensitive. But now, so is Vince.
而文斯又有身材012---Plus Vince has the body. You know?
所以……012---So...
这其实只是数学问题012---It's really just about the math.
杰森   请进012---Jason. Yeah, come on in.
你在电话里的语气很严肃012---Uh, Phoebe, you sounded serious on the phone.
出了什么事吗012---Is, uh, anything wrong?
没事012---No.
你一定是罗斯012---You must be Ross.
你好  我是萨吉大师012---Hi. I am Guru Saj.
老实说  我以前从未找过大师  所以…012---Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never been to a guru before, so...
放轻松  我在中美洲念过很好的医学院012---Well, relax. If it makes you feel any better, I've attended...
这样你比较安心了吧012---...some of the finest medical schools in Central America.
来看看你的皮肤异常吧012---Well, then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.
请坐012---Come on, have a seat.
跟我想的一样   是昆度斯012---Aha. As I suspected, it's a kundus.
什么是昆度斯012---What's a "kundus"?
不知道   昆度斯对你来说是什么012---I don't know. What's a kundus with you?
请趴下012---Please lie down.
我有一种药膏可以让它缩小012---I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.
值得一试012---Well, I guess it's worth a try.
那当然  效果应该…012---Oh, sure. We should see results...
噢  显然不能这么做012---Whoa! Clearly not the way to go.
为什么012---What? What?
我们似乎惹它生气了012---We appear to have angered it.
我们  惹它生气了012---We? We angered it?
我看到问题在哪里了012---Oh. I think I see the problem.
恐怕我们得动用  更有力的手段012---And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.
爱012---Love.
天啊012---Oh, God.
罗斯  它绝对不可能脱落…012---Ross, there is absolutely no way this is gonna come off...
除非你开始…012---...unless you start to... Ow.
怎么了012---Oops. What was that?
它掉下来了012---Well, it's gone.
怎么会012---How's that?
被我的手表刮掉了012---Got caught in my watch.
嘿012---Hey, ha, ha.
灯光012---Lights.
浪漫的灯光012---Uh, romantic lights.
真棒012---Ooh, nice. Ha, ha.
我说过有事要告诉你012---So, uh, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
对   我都忘了012---Oh, right. I completely forgot about that.
嗯…012---Well, uh...
我最近想了很多012---I've been doing a lot of thinking.
回顾我的人生…012---And I look at my life...
是吗012---Yeah?
我觉得已经征服了商界012---And I feel like I've conquered the business world.
已经征服了知识界012---And I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world.
现在又拥有世界上最美的女人012---And now I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
但是还有一个缺憾012---But there's one thing missing.
什么缺憾012---What's that?
我该征服体育界了012---It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
好012---Okay.
摩妮卡  我想成为…012---Monica? I wanna become...
终极格斗冠军012---...the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
