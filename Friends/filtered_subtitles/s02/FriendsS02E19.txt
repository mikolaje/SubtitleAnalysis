够了  我要你立刻离开这间公寓012---That's it. I want you out of the apartment now!
你在胡说什么012---Oh, what are you talking about?
人魔汉尼拔012---Hannibal Lecter?
他比你更适合当室友012---Better roommate than you.
不012---No.
我觉得你不公平  某天晚上你看到我  觉得很可怕012---I don't think you're being fair! One night you see me, you get scared.
你没看到我的那些晚上呢012---What about the other nights when you don't see me, huh?
昨晚你起床喝水012---Last night you went and got some water...
我好心地躲在门后  那又如何012---...and I was nice enough to hide behind the door. What that about, huh?
我不知道012---I didn't realize that. Ah.
快给我滚012---Get out now!

明天你下班回来会发现我不在了012---I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.

终于把时光机修好了012---Finally got that time machine working, huh?
你们喜欢吗012---You like it?
有个家伙在第八大道卖衣服  我心想012---This guy was selling them on 8th Avenue and I thought:
〝你知道我没有什么吗〞   镜子012---"You know what I don't have?"  A mirror?
好吧  尽量开玩笑  我觉得这个造型蛮潇洒的012---Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
对刚失业的人来说  你的心情蛮不错的012---Wow! For a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in a good mood.
我会没事的  我又不是从头开始012---I'll be all right. I'm not starting from square one.
我在《我们的日子》 饰演过德瑞克雷莫瑞医生012---I was Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of our Lives.
那应该有某种关连吧012---Huh? That's got to have some kind of cachet.

瑞秋  你一定要看这本书  书名是《做自己的追风人》012---Uh! You have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.
描述女性必须更有力量012---Ooh. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
还有风012---And, oh! But there's wind.
风让我们成为女神012---And the wind can make us goddesses.
你知道谁把我们的风抢走了吗   男人  他们抢走风了012---Do you know who takes our wind? Men. They just take it.
男人抢走风了012---Men just take our wind?
一直都是的  因为他们是闪电人012---Uh-huh. All the time. Because they are the lightning-bearers.
哇  耶012---Wow. Yeah.
那听起来很酷  蛮像哈比人的012---That sounds kind of cool. It's like The Hobbit.
一点都不像012---It is nothing like The Hobbit.
它像是看穿了我的每段恋情012---It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had.
理查除外012---Except for Richard.
理查不会抢走你的风012---Oh, yes. No. Richard would never steal your wind.
没错  没错012---No. No.
因为他是帅哥  没错012---Because he's yummy.  Yes.
但其他男人就会012---But all the other ones.
有一段描述他们不断地吸干012---Oh, and the part about how they're always drinking...
我们的内心力量012---...from our pool of inner power.
但上帝禁止我们使用内心力量012---But God forbid we should take a sip.
谁要吃油条012---Anybody want a cruller?
这是闪电人的典型作法012---This is a typical lightning-bearer thing.
那像是…012---Right there. It's like, um...
〝谁要吃我老二形状的蛋糕〞012---..."Hello. Who wants one of my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"
别担心  情况很不错012---Don't worry about it, already! Things happen.
所以你不气我被开除012---So you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
乔伊  看着我012---Joey, look at me.
看着我012---Look at me!
我的牙齿沾到口红了吗012---Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
没有012---No.

太棒了012---All right!
〝二号计程车司机〞012---"Cab Driver Number 2"?
不客气012---You're welcome.
但我演过德瑞克雷莫端医生012---But... But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
我怎么从神经外科医生  变成开计程车的012---How can I go from being a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?
时代会改变  接受吧012---Things change. Roll with them.
但这个角色只有两句台词012---But this is a two-line part!
这是在退步012---It's like taking a step backwards.
我才不要这份工作012---I'm not gonna do this.
乔伊012---Joey.
我跟你说的话就像我跟阿尔明查012---I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minza...
还有他的狗狗金字塔说的话一样012---...and his pyramid of dogs.
有工作就做  别在地上大便012---Take any job you can get, and don't make on the floor.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
再见012---I'll see you.
天啊012---Uh, God!
天啊  我是说它真的…012---Oh, God! I mean, it's just so...
对吧012---Isn't it?
这像是在看我的一生012---Uh. This is like reading about my own life!
这本书应该叫 《做你自己的追风人  瑞秋》012---This book could have been called Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!
虽然会卖不了一百万本012---It wouldn't have sold a million copies...
但会是送你很不错的礼物012---...but it would've made a nice gift for you.
大家好  嘿012---Hey, you guys. Hey.
甜心  我们该走了012---Uh, sweetie, we've gotta go.
不012---No!
不012---No? Heh.
不  为什么我们总得  照你的时间表来做事012---No! Why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?
事实上那是电影院的时间表012---Actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.
这样你才不会错过开头012---It's so you don't miss the beginning.
不  这跟电影院无关  问题是你抢走我的风了012---This isn't about the movie theater. This is about you stealing my wind.
加油  好姊妹012---You go, girl!
我做得很不像吧012---I can't pull that off, can I?
对不起  你的风012---Excuse me, your wind?
对  我的风012---Yes, my wind.
你不让我吹  又怎么能期待成长012---How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
你知道我…012---You know I don't...
可以接受你那么做012---...have a problem with that.
好吧012---Okay.
现在我需要独处一下012---I just really need to be with myself right now.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
你们说的对012---Mm, mm, mm.Uh, you're right.
我不必道歉012---I don't have to apologize.
抱歉  该死012---Sorry. Damn it!
那是什么  我不知道012---What is it? I don't know.
里面提到风跟树012---It's got all this stuff about wind and trees...
还有圣池012---...and some sacred pool.
我看不懂  但她似乎非常生气012---I don't really get it. But she's pretty upset about it.
所以我不跟会看书的女人约会012---This is why I don't date women who read.
啊-哦012---Uh-oh.
什么  那是什么012---What? What's that?
我的信用卡帐单012---It's my VISA bill.
一式两联012---Envelope one of two.
这不会是好事  快打开012---That can't be good. Open it, open it.
天啊012---Oh, my God! Whoa!
看看这个  我怎么会花这么多钱012---Look at this! How did I spend so much money?
乔伊  那是最低应缴额度  总额在那边012---Uh, that's just the minimum amount. That's your total.
啊012---Aah!
在〝原野瓷器〞刷了三千五012---Whoa, whoa. Thirty-five hundred dollars at "Porcelain Safari"?

店员说它们很适合我  他说起话来有口音  我很困惑012---The guy said they suited me. He spoke with an accent. I was confused.
噢012---Oh.
我不知道该怎么办012---I don't know what to do!
你可以开始在《未来日记》开计程车012---You can start by driving a cab on Another World.
什么  那个试镜机会012---What?  That audition?
那个角色只有两句台词012---That's a two-line part!
乔伊  你在〝我爱透明塑胶玻璃〞欠下一千一百块012---Joey, you owe $1100 at "I Love Lucite."
那又怎么样  接受吧012---So what?  So suck it up, man.
那是工作  可以赚钱012---It's a job. It's money.
我不要你变得爱批评  高傲又爱卖弄学问012---I don't need you getting judgmental and condescending and pedantic.
来自卫生纸  对012---Toilet paper?  Yeah.
我不是那样的人  我只是很现实012---I'm not being any of those things. I'm being realistic.
不必了  你应该是我的朋友  我是你的朋友012---You're supposed to be my friend!  I am your friend.
那你该跟我说〝你会没事的〞012---Then tell me things like, "You'll be fine."
〝你一定会出头的  我知道〞012---And "Something big's gonna come along. I know it!"
但我真的不知道012---But I don't know it.
我只知道你在〝漂亮着色〞欠下两千三百块钱012---What I do know is you owe $2300 at "Isn't It Chromantic?"
罗斯  我知道我欠了多少钱012---I'm aware of what I owe.
你得有点理智  你等了十年才找到那份工作012---Then get some sense. It took you 10 years to get that job.
下份工作又得等多久  我不想听012---How long till you get another?  I don't want to hear this!
我只是说…012---I'm just saying...
别〝只是说〞012---Well, don't "just say"!
或许我该先离开012---Oh. Maybe I should just go.
好吧012---Okay.
待会见012---I'll see you later.
考虑一下012---Just think about it.
我不需要考虑012---I don't need to think about it!
我是德瑞克雷莫瑞医生012---I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

艾迪  你是不是忘了什么012---Aren't you forgetting anything?
对了  我帮我们买了新金鱼012---Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.
他比上一只金鱼还有活力012---He's feistier than the last one.
或许因为上一只金鱼  是培珀莉饼干做的012---Maybe because the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.
艾迪  你是不是忘了做什么事012---Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing now?
不  除非它跟脱水有关012---Not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating.
因为现在我是脱水迷012---Because right now, I'm a dehydrating maniac!
我以为我们说好了012---I thought we had a deal.
我以为我回来时…012---I thought by the time I got... Uh, uh.

我得说你不觉得那有点突然吗012---Ooh! Ha, ha. I gotta tell you, that's kind of out of the blue, don't you think?
一点都不突然012---This is not out of the blue!
这完全都不突然012---This is smack-dab in the middle of the blue!
哇012---Whoa!
放轻松  别激动012---Relax! Take it easy, buddy!
你不必告诉我第二次012---You don't have to tell me twice.
天啊  我会找人来搬我的东西012---God, I mean, someone will be by for my stuff.
如果你以为我会让你跟我的鱼独处  你就疯了012---If you think I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane!

我不需要帮忙  朋友012---No help required, chico!
一路直达机场  那超过三十哩远012---All the way to the airport, huh? You know, that's over 30 miles.

你知道这是怎么一回事吗   传真过来的剧本字体有点模糊012---Oh. You know what it is? It's smudgy because they're fax pages.
我在《我们的日子》 演德瑞克雷莫瑞医生时012---When I was on Days ofour Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray...
他们会把完整剧本寄过来给我012---...they'd send over the whole script on real paper.
那真的太棒了012---Ha, ha. That's great.
如果你要加戏  譬如让计程车发生车祸012---If you wanted to expand this scene, like have the cab crash...
我可以治疗乘客012---...I could attend to the victims...
因为我有演医生的背景012---...because I have a background in medical acting.
