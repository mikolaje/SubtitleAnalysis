嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
琼还好吗   跟她分手了012---So how was Joan? Broke up with her.
哦  为什么012---Oh, why?
别说  是鼻孔太大的问题吗012---Don't tell me. Because of the big nostril thing?
真的很大012---They were huge.
她打喷嚏的时候  会有蝙蝠飞出来012---When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
得了吧  没那么大啦012---Come on, they were not that huge.
我告诉你  她一躺下我就能看穿她的大脑012---I'm telling you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
你还要拒绝多少好女人012---How many women will you reject...
只为了外表或不重要的小事…012---...over the most superficial, insignificant things?
等等  这次我要站在钱德这一边012---Hold it. Hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
我刚搬到这里的时候  有跟一个女孩约会012---When I first moved to the city, I went out with this girl.
真的很辣  很会接吻012---Really hot. Great kisser...
可是她的喉结超大的012---...but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
快把我逼疯了012---Drove me nuts.
你来还是我来   我来好了012---You or me?  I got it.
乔伊  女人是没有喉结的012---Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
你们又在恶整我了  对吧012---Heh, heh. You guys are messing with me, right?
对  正是012---Yeah. We are.
这次很厉害  刚才我还在想〝哦〞012---That's a good one. For a second there, I was like, whoa!
《老友记》  第二季  第3集  黑考斯死掉了012---Friends S02E03: The One Where Mr. Heckles Dies
你举出一个有实际的理由才分手的女人012---So you name one woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason.
玛琳·摩丝拉012---Maureen Rasillo.
她不讨厌雅尼  不能算是实际的理由012---Because she doesn't hate Yanni is not a real reason.
哈罗  黑考斯先生012---Hello, Mr. Heckles.
你们又来了012---You're doing it again.
我们没做什么啊012---We're not doing anything.
你们在跺脚  吵到我的鸟了012---You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
你又没有养鸟012---You don't have birds.
我原来可养鸟的012---I could have birds.
我们会尽量小声啦   谢谢012---Okay, we'll try to keep it down. Thank you.
我要回去享受我的晚宴了012---I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
好吧  拜拜012---All right, bye-bye.
好  珍妮丝 就说珍妮丝好了 那可不叫挑剔了012---Okay, Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
珍妮丝为例还可以012---We'll give you Janice.
虽然说我会想念珍妮丝012---I miss Janice, though.
哈罗  钱德宾012---Hello, Chandler Bing!
哦  我的天  哦  钱德012---Oh, my God! Oh, Chandler!
快  快012---Now! Now!
就是这样012---That's it.
对  快点012---There! Faster!
放下你的扫把  我们又没有制造噪音012---Ugh. Stop with the broom! We're not making noise!
我们赢了012---We won.
我们成功了012---We won! Whoo!  Whoo!
黑考斯先生012---Mr. Heckles.
怎么发生的  当时他一定是在扫地012---How did this happen?  He was sweeping.
他们发现他还拿着扫把012---They found a broom in his hand.
太可怕了  我知道012---Oh.Oh, dear God. That's terrible. I know.
昨天我也有扫地012---I was sweeping yesterday.
也有可能是我012---It could've been me. Yeah.
扫地  真是没想到012---Sure. Sweeping. You never know.
真是天晓得012---Never know.
好  很微弱  不过我还是可以感觉到他还在这栋建筑物里012---Okay, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.
快走到光里面  黑考斯先生012---Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
好了  菲比012---Okay, Phoebe.
很抱歉  不过有时候他们是需要协助的012---I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.
对  又来了012---Yeah. Here we go.
没关系  你们尽管嘲笑我012---That's fine, go ahead and scoff.
有很多东西我并不相信...012---There are a lot of things I don't believe in...
也不代表那些东西就不存在012---...but that doesn't mean they're not true.
比如012---Such as?
比如玉米田的圆圈圈  或百慕达三角  或进化论012---Like crop circles or the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.
哇  哇  哇012---Whoa, whoa, whoa.
哈  你不相信进化论012---What, you don't believe in evolution?
不是很信012---No. Not really.
你不相信进化论012---You don't believe in evolution?
我不知道  只是  就是…012---I don't know. It's just, you know...
猴子啦  达尔文啦  故事是不赖  我只是觉得太简单了012---Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story. I just think it's a little too easy.
太简单  太…012---"Too easy"? Too...
本星球上所有生物的进化过程…012---The process of every living thing on this planet evolving...
从单细胞生物开始千百万年的进化  你说〝太简单〞了012---...over millions of years from single-celled organisms is "too easy"?
对  我就是不相信这套理论012---Yeah, I just don't buy it.
抱歉  进化论  不在于你信或不信  菲比012---Excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe.
进化论是科学的事实 就像我们所呼吸的空气012---Evolution is scientific fact, like the air we breathe...
就像地心引力012---...like gravity.
别惹我开始谈地心引力012---Okay, don't get me started on gravity.
你…012---You, uh...
你不相信地心引力012---You don't believe in gravity?
不在于我信或不信啦012---Well, it's not so much that, you know, I don't believe in it.
只是我近来觉得…012---Lately I get the feeling that...
我没感受到一股拉力  倒是觉得很被压抑012---...I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
被压抑012---Pushed.
牛顿来了  而且他很火大012---Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.
她在 还有另外那个 就在那边012---There she is. And over there, that's the other one.
他是黑考斯的律师巴迪  他要跟你们谈谈012---This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
我们能帮什么忙012---What can we do for you?
好了  孩子们  情况是这样012---All right, kids, here's the deal.
根据我客户的遗嘱012---According my client's will...
他想把他所有的资产留给…012---...he wants to leave all his earthly possessions...
〝住在我公寓上方那些吵死人的女孩子们〞012---...to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine."
他的家人呢012---What about his family?
他没有家人012---He didn't have any. Whoa.
好  那我们就来谈钱的问题012---Okay, so let's talk money.
可以  钱是没有012---All right, there was none.
现在  谈签字的事了012---Now, let's talk signing.
你是第一号吵死人女孩  你是第二号吵死人女孩012---You be noisy girl number one. You be noisy girl number two.
很难相信  我们一直以为他很讨厌我们012---I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.
真是令人诧异  能如此触及别人的生命…012---Isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life...
却浑然不觉012---...without even knowing it?
你们看看这堆垃圾012---Would you look at this dump?
他真的很恨我们  这是他最后的复仇012---He hated us! This was his final revenge!
我从没见过这么多垃圾012---Ever seen so much crap!
我想事实上  这间公寓污辱了垃圾的美名012---Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap.
你们看看012---Check this out.
这个可以给我吗012---Can I have this?
你怎么可能不相信进化论012---How can you not believe in evolution?
我不知道  就是不信  你们看看这件怪衬衫012---I don't know, just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
菲比  我整个成年生涯都在研究进化论012---Pheebs, I've studied evolution my entire adult life.
我们从全球各地搜集许多化石012---And I can tell you, we've collected fossils from all over the world...
这些化石真的可以显现不同物种的进化012---...that actually show the evolution of different species.
我是说  你真的可以看到012---I mean, you can literally see them...
这些物种长时间的进化012---...evolving through time.
真的  真的看得到012---Really? You can actually see it?
那是一定的  美国 中国 非洲 全世界都有012---You bet! In the U.S., China, Africa, all over!
这样啊  我不晓得012---See, I didn't know that.
嗯  你长知识了012---Well, there you go.
呵012---Huh.
真正的关键在于是谁把化石放在那里的  又为了什么012---So now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why?
看看这东西 〝我的牢骚语录〞012---Hey. Look at this. My Big Book of Grievances.
嘿  有我012---Hey, there's me.
〝4月17日  巨大的噪音…012---"April 17th, excessive noise...
意大利佬带约会对象回家〞012---...ltalian guy comes home with a date." Yeah.
钱德你看  也有你012---Chandler, you're in here too.
〝4月18日  巨大噪音…012---"April 18th, excessive noise...
意大利佬的同志室友带干洗衣物回家〞012---...ltalian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning."
嗯  记录得很好012---Well, that's excellent.
摩妮卡  看看这盏灯012---Monica, look at this lamp.
这算俗气或什么  这个我们一定要012---Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
我想我们一般的灯已经够多了012---I think we have enough regular lamps.
什么  得了 我又不是…012---What? Come on, it's not like...
想要这种娃娃型的钟  或什么的012---...I'm asking for this girlie clock or anything.
对了  我觉得这个也很酷012---Which, by the way, I also think is really cool.
喂  这跟我的东西不搭啦012---Look, it doesn't go with any of my stuff.
嗯  那我的东西呢012---Well, what about my stuff?
你又没有任何东西012---You don't have any stuff.
你还是认为那是你的公寓对吧012---You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
不是  是  你是的012---Mmm... No. Yes, you do.
你认为那是你的公寓  我只是租一间房间而已012---You think of it as your apartment and I just rent a room.
唔012---Mmm...
你继续〝嗯〞好了  我要去找个地方放我的新台灯012---Okay, while you "mmm" on that, I'll go find a place for my new lamp.
好  菲比  看到我怎么动这些小玩具的吗012---Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move?
拇指相对论012---Opposable thumbs!
若非进化论  你如何解释拇指相对论012---Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
也许是那些太空舰长为了操纵太空舰才衍生的012---Maybe the Overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
跟我说你只是在开玩笑012---Tell me you're joking.
喂  这样说好了  你相信某事但我不信012---Look, can't we just say that you believe in something and I don't?
不  菲比  不可以   有何不可012---No. No, Pheebs, we can't. Why not?
干嘛非要别人认同你的看法呢012---What is this obsessive need you have to make everybody agree with you?
到底是为什么 你知道我所想012---No, what's that all about? You know what I think?
也许是你把〝罗斯〞放在显微镜下的时候了012---I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
有血从我耳里喷出来吗012---Is there blood coming out of my ears?
你们看  黑考斯的中学纪念册012---Check it out. Heckles' high-school yearbook.
哇  他看起来很正常耶012---Wow. He looks so normal.
他甚至有点可爱012---He's even kind of cute.
〝黑考斯  连自然课你都能让我开怀大笑012---"Heckles, you crack me up in science class.
你是全校最好玩的小孩〞012---You're the funniest kid in school."
最好玩  黑考斯   上面是这样说的012---Funniest? Heckles?  That's what it says.
黑考斯曾当选班上的小丑  我也是012---Wow. Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I.
他是对的  你们听听看012---He was right. Would you listen to that?
我也会称之为巨大的噪音012---I'd call that excessive.
什么012---Whoa. What?
黑考斯在乐团吹竖笛  我也吹竖笛012---Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet.
他是模型社团的会员  我也是…012---And he was in the scale modeler's club and I was...
我们是没有社团  不过我真的觉得他们很酷012---Well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
那又怎样  你们两个都是书呆子012---So? You were both dorks.
有啥大不了的012---Big deal.
我只是觉得很诡异  知道吗  黑考斯跟我…012---I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me...
黑考斯跟我  我…012---Heckles and me. Me...
我跟黑考斯012---Me and Heckles.
嘿  你们别吵了012---Hey, would you knock it off!
啊012---Ah!
你整晚都在这里吗012---Have you been here all night?
看看这个012---Look at this.
所有跟黑考斯交往过的女人012---Pictures of all the women Heckles went out with.
看看他写的评语 〝薇薇安  太高〞012---Look what he wrote on them. "Vivian, too tall."
〝玛斯  牙龈太露〞012---"Madge, big gums."
〝太吵〞012---"Too loud."
〝太聪明〞 〝吃东西时太大声〞012---"Too smart." "Makes noise when she eats."
这就是我012---This is me.
这就是我的作法012---This is what I do.
我会一人孤独的死去  就像他这样012---I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
钱德  黑考斯是个神经病012---Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
我们的火车走在相同的轨道上012---Our trains are on the same track.
我是落后他30年  可是终点站完全一样012---I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same.
苦涩的小镇…012---Bitter Town...
孤单的小城  隐者小站012---...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!
知道我们该怎么做吗  带你离开这里012---You know what we gotta do? Get you out of here.
来吧  我请你吃早餐012---Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
万一我永远找不到对象呢  或更惨 万一我找到了…012---What if I never find somebody? Or worse, what if I found her...
就因为她的口头禅是〝有可能〞就甩掉她了呢012---...but I dumped her because she pronounces it "supposably"?
钱德  得了吧  你会找到对象的012---Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
你哪会知道呢  哪会012---How do you know that? How?
我是不知道  我只是想拉你一把012---I don't know. I'm just trying to help you out.
你们都会结婚012---You guys will all get married...
而我会孤寂而终012---...and I'll end up alone.
你能答应我一件事吗012---Will you promise me something?
等你结婚后  你可以都邀我过去过节吗012---When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
我不晓得到时候  我们会想做什么012---I don't know what we'll be doing.
我是指  万一我们得去她爸妈家过节呢012---I mean, what if we're over at her folks' place?
对  我了解012---Yeah, I understand.
你倒是可以过来看超级杯012---You can come over and watch the Super Bowl.
每年都来  好吗012---Every year, all right?
知道吗  我不要这种结局012---You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this.
我们待会儿见  老兄012---I'll see you, man.
咦呀012---Jeez.
〝有可能〞012---"Supposably."
有可能012---Supposably.
他们到动物园去了吗012---Did they go to the zoo?
有可能012---Supposably.
嗨  是我012---Hi. It's me.
哦  我的天012---Oh, my God!
珍妮丝  你打给珍妮丝012---Janice? You called Janice?
对  珍妮丝012---Yes. Janice.
你们为何如此难以理解012---Why is that difficult to comprehend?
你还记得珍妮丝吧012---You remember Janice, right?
对  她很聪明  很漂亮  而且她真的很在乎我012---Yes. She was smart, she was pretty and she honestly cared about me.
珍妮丝是我的最后机会012---Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
哈罗012---Hello.
哦  我的天012---Oh, my God!
天啊  看看她变得多胖012---Jeez, look how fat she got.
嘿  大家都在   嗨  珍妮丝012---Hey, it's everybody. Hi, Janice.
珍妮丝  你已经…012---Janice, you're...
对  我是012---Yes, I am.
那是…   是你的吗012---Is it...?  Is it yours? Ha!
少作梦了  钱德宾012---You wish, Chandler Bing.
我现在可是一个已婚妇人了012---You are looking at a married lady now.
噢012---Oh.
耶012---Yeah.
恭喜012---Congratulations.
亲爱的  我很抱歉012---Aw, sweetie, I'm sorry.
通电话时  你就不能先告诉我012---You couldn't tell me on the phone?
然后呢  错失你惊讶的表情   哦  不行012---And what? Miss the expression on your face? Oh, no.
珍妮丝也想开心一下012---Janice likes to have her fun.
瑞秋  知道我们有一阵子没玩什么游戏了吗012---You know what we haven't played in a while?
什么  〝把灯藏起来〞012---What?  Hide the lamp.
摩妮卡  少来了012---Monica, let it go.
你知道我对贝壳类过敏吗012---Did you know I'm allergic to shellfish?
那你只好去吃别的台灯012---Then you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
是那个可怕的科学人012---Uh-oh. It's scary scientist man.
好  菲比  时候到了012---Okay, Phoebe, this is it.
在这皮箱中 我带来真正的科学事实012---In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.
请注意  是有一整箱的事实012---A briefcase of facts, if you will.
这里有些化石 都是超过两亿年之久的012---Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
在你开始前  我先声明  我不是在否认进化论012---Okay, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution.
我是说那只是一种可能性012---It's just one of the possibilities.
菲比  是唯一的可能性012---It's the only possibility.
罗斯  请放开你的思想  就一点点行吗012---Ross, could you just open your mind, like, this much? Okay?
过去也有最聪明的人  相信地球是扁的  不是吗012---Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believe the Earth was flat?
50年之前  你们还认为原子是最小的东西…012---And up till 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing...
直到你们打开了原子  才跑出一大堆鬼东西012---...until you split it open and this whole mess of crap came out.
你现在却告诉我  你是如此难以置信的自大012---Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant...
你完全不肯承认此事  的确有一点点  一丝丝012---...that you can't admit that there's a teeny, tiny possibility...
错误的可能性012---...that you could be wrong about this?
是有那么…012---There might be...
一点点…012---...a teeny...
一丝丝的…012---...tiny...
可能性012---...possibility.
真不敢相信你屈服了012---I can't believe you caved.
什么   你刚抛弃你整个信仰系统012---What? You just abandoned your whole belief system!
之前  我虽然不认同你  最起码我还敬重你012---Before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you.
可是…012---But...
你明天要如何去上班012---How are you gonna go into work tomorrow?
你将如何面对其他的科学人012---How are you going to face the other science guys?
你将如何面对你自己012---How are you going to face yourself? Oh...
真好玩  有谁饿了  我012---That was fun. So who's hungry? I am.
我也是  我去拿我的外套012---Me too. Let me just get my coat.
出什么事了   好吧   没事012---What happened? Okay. All right.
是意外  我发誓012---It was an accident, I swear.
我在穿外套然后那东东  那台灯  就破了012---I was putting on my jacket and the thing and the lamp and it broke.
哦  拜托  摩妮卡  你一向讨厌我的灯012---Oh, please, Monica! You've always hated my lamp!
如今  突然的神来一笔  它就破了012---And now all of a sudden, it's just magically, it's just broken?
菲比  你告诉她012---Phoebe, tell her?
好  我没看到  当时我也在穿外套012---I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket.
不过  我想相信你012---But I want to believe you.
钱德  摩妮卡刚刚打破我的贝壳灯012---Hey, Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
了不起012---Neat.
我会孤寂而终012---I'm gonna die alone!
好  算你赢012---Okay, you win.
钱德  你不会孤寂而终的啦012---Chandler, you are not gonna die alone.
珍妮丝本来是我的救生网  好吗012---Janice was my safety net, okay?
现在我只好去找一条蛇了012---And now I have to get a snake.
这又是为了什么012---Uh-huh. Why is that?
如果我势必会成为孤伶伶的老头子  我就需要有个东西012---If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing.
像是依靠012---You know, a hook.
就像在地下铁吃自己脸的那个家伙012---Like that guy on the subway who eats his own face.
所以我想要成为〝带着蛇的疯子〞012---So I figure I'll be "Crazy Man With A Snake."
疯狂的蛇人012---Crazy Snake Man.
然后我会弄更多的蛇  叫他们我的宝贝012---Then I'll get more snakes, call them my babies.
小鬼经过我住的地方都会用跑的012---Kids won't walk past my place, they will run!
他们会边跑边叫〝逃离疯狂的蛇人〞012---"Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
你得走出来才行012---You've got to get over this. Okay?
你不会孤寂而终的012---You won't end up alone.
我当然会012---Of course I am.
我拒绝每一个疯狂到真的跟我交往的对象012---I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me...
然后我才来抱怨  这世上根本没有好女人012---...and then I bitch that there aren't any great women out there.
钱德012---Chandler
你刚刚的形容012---You have just described...
其实就跟我们交往过的每一个男人一样012---...virtually every man that we've ever gone out with.
耶012---Yeah.
你不是怪物  你是一个正常男人012---You are not a freak. You're a guy.
