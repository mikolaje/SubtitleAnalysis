西班牙侏儒摔跤…012---Spanish midgets wrestling...
茱莉  好  是的  我懂你为何会这样联想012---Julie. Okay, yes, I see how you got there.
你搞清楚了那玩意的用途吗012---You ever figure out what that thing's for?
不  是这样的  我在试着过滤电话012---No, see, I'm trying this screening thing.
我认为我老是接电话  人们会觉得我生活贫乏012---I figure if I always answer the phone, people will think I don't have a life.
我的天  罗德里哥从来不会被压制012---My God. Rodrigo never gets pinned.
哔声要来了  你知道该怎么做012---Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
你好  我要找巴伯012---Hello. I'm looking for Bob.
我是洁德012---This is Jade.
我不知道你是否还用这号码  但我只是想到彼此012---I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us...
和以前有多棒  我知道那已是三年前的事  但…012---...and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years...
我有点希望我们能再次碰头012---...but I was kind of hoping we could hook up again.
你知道吗  我几乎没勇气打这通电话012---You know, I barely had the nerve to make this call...
所以你知道我做了什么吗   什么012---...so you know what I did? - What?
我喝得微醺012---I got a little drunk...
还全身赤裸012---...and naked.
我是巴伯012---Bob here.

你知道村区的中央咖啡厅吗  五点左右怎样012---Do you know, uh, Central Perk in the village? Say, five-ish?
太好了  到时见  好012---Great. I'll see you then. Okay.
很好012---Okay.
装电话终于值得了012---Having a phone has finally paid off.
就算你模仿巴伯很像012---Even though you do do a good Bob impression...
我想她明天见到你时012---...I'm thinking when she sees you tomorrow...
她大概会发现  嘿  你不是巴伯012---...she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not Bob.
我希望的是  当巴伯放她鸽子的时候012---I am hoping that when Bob doesn't show up...
她会投向邻桌的陌生人的怀抱012---...she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
我的天  你邪恶到极点012---Oh, my God. You are pure evil.
好  邪恶到极点012---Okay, pure evil...
欲望难耐又孤单012---...horny and alone.
我曾经这样过012---I've done this.
对  大家都在这012---Yeah, yeah, everybody's here.

嗨  茱莉012---Hi, Julie.
嗨  茱莉012---Hi, Julie.
好  趁着罗斯在讲电话012---Okay. While Ross is on the phone...
大家欠我六十二元  用来庆祝他生日012---...everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
有没有可能 你取个整数就好012---Um, is there any chance that you're rounding up from...
像是二十元012---...you know, from like 20?
拜托  我们要买礼物  看演唱会和买蛋糕012---Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert and the cake.
我们需要蛋糕012---Do we need a cake?
听着  我知道金额有点高012---Look, I know it's a little steep.
喔嘘012---Whoosh.
不过是为了罗斯012---But it's Ross.
对  是为了罗斯  你说得对012---Yeah, it's Ross. Yeah, you're right.
好吗  好  大家待会见  我必须去…012---All right? Okay. I'll see you later. I gotta go...
做一件事012---...do a thing.
好  亲爱的  我今晚再打给你012---Okay, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight.
等等  你不会真的要这么做吧012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, you're not really going through with this, are you?
我想我也许就会012---You know, I think I might just.
那么你们今晚晚上吃什么012---So, uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
我想我必须开始为罗斯的生日存钱012---Well, I guess I gotta start saving up for Ross' birthday.
所以我可能会留在家里吃西北风了012---So I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
你们能相信这要花那么多钱吗012---Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
你们有没有过这种感觉…012---Do you guys ever get the feeling that, um...
钱德和他们几个…012---...Chandler and those guys...
不了解我们赚的钱不如他们多012---...just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
对  真的012---Yes. Really?
他们老是说 〝去这里 去那里〞012---It's like they're always saying, "Let's go here, let's go there."
好像我们真的有那个闲钱一样   对012---Like we can afford to go here and there.  Yeah.
而且我们总是得去“好地方” 你知道吗012---Yes, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know?
我们连反对的权利都没有  因为这是Ross的生日012---It's not like we can say anything about it, because, like, this is a birthday thing...
而且是为了罗斯012---...you know, and it's for Ross.
为了罗斯   为了罗斯012---For Ross. For Ross.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
嗨  怎么了012---Hi.  What?
是这样的  我在工作012---Okay. I'm at work...
只是平凡的一天  切菜…炒菜…012---...just an ordinary day, you know, chop, chop, sauté, sauté.
突然间经理里昂  叫我到他办公室012---All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
原来他们开除了午餐主厨  猜猜谁取代他的职位了012---Turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
假如不是你  这故事还真悲惨012---If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
幸好是我012---Fortunately, it is me. Oh.
而且他们升我为采购主管  感激不尽012---And they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
真棒012---That's so cool.
我刚刚在楼下碰到钱德和罗斯  我们应该出外庆祝012---Anyway, I just ran into Chandler and Ross. We should go out and celebrate.
去个好地方012---You know, someplace nice.
去个好地方  对012---Someplace nice. Yeah.
你想我卖肾能赚多少钱012---How much you think I can get for my kidney?
我告诉你  你不能这么做012---I'm telling you, you can't do this.
拜托  我用普通方法绝对追不到那种女生012---Oh, come on, I can't get a girl like that with conventional methods.
那不是重点012---That doesn't matter.
她是要打电话给巴伯012---She wanted to call Bob.
就我们所知  巴伯才应该跟她在一起012---Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with.
你也许在破坏  两个人追求快乐的机会012---You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
我们不认识巴伯012---We don't know Bob.
好吗  我们认识我  我们喜欢我  拜托让我快乐012---Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
过去那里  告诉那女人真相012---Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
好吧012---All right.
去012---Go.
嗨012---Hi.
嗨012---Hi.
听着  我必须…012---Listen, I have to, uh, ahem...
我必须坦诚一件事012---I have to confess something.
什么事012---Yes?
放你鸽子的那个人是烂人012---Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
你怎么…   我不知道012---How did you...  I don't know.
我只是有种奇怪的感应  不过这就是我  我古怪而敏感012---I just had this weird sense. You know? But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.
要面纸吗012---Tissue?
谢了012---Thanks.
不  你留着那包012---No, no, you keep the pack.
我今天已经哭完了012---I'm all cried out today.
好了…012---Okay, okay.

午餐主厨  采购  罗兰不在场时有自己的小办公桌012---Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there...
敬我的妹妹… 等等  我还收到呼叫器012---...here's to my little sister... Oh, wait. And I got a beeper.
好酷012---Oh, cool.
很好  我先等  对不起012---That's fine, I'll just wait.  Aw, sorry.
对不起…012---JOEY: Oh, sorry, sorry.
敬摩妮卡012---Monica.
大家准备点菜了吗012---Are we ready to order?
我们还没看菜单012---Oh. You know, we haven't even looked yet.
那你们看过之后再叫我012---Well, when you do, just let me know.
我会坐在我座位边等候012---I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
哇  看看这些价格012---Wow, look at these prices.
是啊  真不得了012---Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."
对啊  这些是什么  著名的鸡吗012---I know. What are these, famous chickens?
抱歉  我迟到了 摩妮卡  恭喜  谢了012---Sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. - Thanks.
我不为迟到感到抱歉  我跟洁德的午后约会太不可思议了012---I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
根据她在我答录机上留给你的话的确很不可思议012---Well, pretty incredible, according to the message she left on my machine.
嘿  钱德 为什么这个女人在我的答录机留言给你012---Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
我必须告诉她  我的号码是你的号码012---See, I had to tell her that my number was your number.
我不能告诉她  我的号码是我的号码012---I couldn't tell her my number was my number...
因为她以为我的号码是巴伯的号码012---...because she thinks my number is Bob's number.
再告诉我一次  当古板房东罗普打来  我该怎么做012---Hey, tell me again. What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
可以点菜了吗012---Do I dare ask?
好  我开胃菜要生牛肉  然后主菜是烤明虾012---Yes, I'll start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
听起来很棒  我也一样  这位男士呢012---That sounds great, same for me. And for the gentleman?
是  我点泰式鸡肉披萨012---Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.
但是  听着  如果我的不放坚果韭葱等材料012---But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff...
会比较便宜吗012---...is it cheaper?
你是那么想吗012---You'd think, wouldn't you?
小姐  好的012---Miss?  Okay.
我要佐餐的沙拉012---I will have the, uh... side salad.
它要佐什么餐012---And what would that be on the side of?
我不知道012---I don't know.
你就帮我放在我的水旁边好了012---Why don't you just put it right here next to my water?
那你呢012---And for you?
我要一碗黄瓜汤012---Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup...
以及…012---...and, um...
保重012---...take care.
我点纽奥良鱿鱼   还要别的吗012---I will have the, uh, Cajun catfish.  Anything else?
是  来唱一段《情歌销魂》怎样012---Yes, how about a verse of "Killing Me Softly"?
你会朝我的鱼打喷嚏对不对012---You're gonna sneeze in my fish, aren't you?
加上小费除以六012---Plus tip, divided by six...
好  每个人欠我二十八元012---Okay, everyone owes 28 bucks.
每个人012---Um, everyone?
你说得对  真抱歉012---Oh. You're right, I'm sorry.
谢谢012---Thank you.
今晚是摩妮卡的大日子  她不该付钱012---It's Monica's big night. She shouldn't pay.
谢谢012---Aw, thank you.
所以我们五个人…012---So five of us is...
各付三十三块半012---...33.50 apiece.
不  才不要  抱歉  不可能012---No. Uh-uh. No way. Sorry, not gonna happen.
像是毕业舞会情景重演012---Whoa. Whoa. Prom night flashback.
抱歉  摩妮卡  我真的很高兴你升迁012---Sorry, Monica. I'm really happy you got promoted...
但是冷黄瓜糊要三十几元012---...but cold cucumber mush for 30-something bucks?
不012---No.
瑞秋只吃了一小份沙拉012---Rachel just had that little salad...
乔伊则吃他的一小块彼萨012---...and Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.
好  菲比012---Okay, Pheebs.
不如我们各付各的  好吗012---How about we'll each just pay for what we had, okay?
没什么大不了  对你是这样012---It's no big deal.  Not for you.
好了  怎么回事012---All right, what's going on?
好吧  听着  我现在真的不想淌这浑水012---Okay, look, I really don't wanna get into this right now.
这只会让大家都不舒服  好  没关系  好012---It'll just make everybody uncomfortable. Oh, fine. All right, fine.
干嘛   你能告诉我们012---What? Whoa, whoa. You can tell us.
对  拜托  是我们  好吗  我们能接受012---Yeah, hello? It's us. All right? We'll be fine.
是啊012---Yeah.
唔  好的  恩012---Ahem. Okay, um...
我们三个觉得…012---Uh, we three feel like that, uh, ahem...
有时候你们不了解…012---...sometimes you guys don't get that, uh, ahem...
我们的钱不如你们多012---We don't have as much money as you.
好  我听到了012---Okay. I hear you.
我们能讨论这件事012---We can talk about that.
那么…012---Well, then...
就来…012---...let's.
我猜我从没想到  钱会构成问题012---Well, um, I guess I just never think of money as an issue.
因为你有钱  这一点说得好012---That's because you have it. That's a good point.
那么… 你们为何以前从没提过这件事012---So, um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
因为总是有事情发生  像是摩妮卡的新职位012---Because it's always something, you know? Like with Monica's new job...
或是罗斯生日要盛大庆祝012---...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.
什么  嘿…012---What? Whoa, hey.
我不希望我的生日  造成任何负面…012---I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative...
到时候会有盛大庆祝012---There's gonna be a hoopla?
基本上有那玩意  然后还有那玩意后的事…012---Basically there's the thing, and then the stuff after the thing and it's...
假如这会让大家好过些  我们可以别管那玩意012---If it makes anybody feel better, we can just forget the thing...
只要送礼就好012---...and we'll just do the gift.
礼物  那玩意不是礼物012---Gift? The thing's not the gift?
不  那玩意是  我们要去看混混与自大狂合唱团012---No, the thing was we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
混混与…我的天  我听广播就听得到他们的歌012---Hootie and the... Oh, my... I can catch them on the radio.
不  现在我觉得内疚了  你想去参加演唱会012---No. Now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
不  听着  这是我生日012---No, look, hey, it's my birthday...
最重要的是我们能一起欢庆012---...and the important thing is that we all be together.
我们所有人  在一起012---All of us.  Together.
不是在演唱会场012---Not at the concert.
好的  谢  谢了012---Okay. Thank you. - Thanks.
耶012---Yeah.
所以说  伊波拉病毒  真要命吧012---So, the Ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
天呀  摩妮卡  袋子里有什么012---Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?
我不知道  钱德咱们来看看012---I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
像是短剧表演012---Oh, it's like a skit.
原来是六人晚餐  五块牛排012---Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks...
和给菲比的一条茄子012---...and an eggplant for Phoebe.
我们工作地点换了肉类供应商  新商家给我牛排当谢礼012---We switched meat suppliers at work, and they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.
但是等等  还有 钱德  那信封里有什么012---But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in that envelope?
顺带一提  在走廊练习时好像没那么呆012---By the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall.
快点012---Come on.
原来是混混与自大狂合唱团的六张门票012---Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish.
自大狂012---The Blowfish.
我们请客  好吗  所以别担心  由我们招待012---It's on us, all right? So don't worry. This is our treat.
所以…谢谢012---So... thank you.
你们能更冷淡一点吗012---Could you be less enthused?
听着  这是很好的表示  真的012---Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.
可是感觉就像…012---But it just feels like...
像…012---Like?
施舍  施舍012---Charity.  Charity?
我们只是想做好事012---We're just trying to do a nice thing here.
但是  罗斯  你必须了解  你的好事令我们觉得好渺小012---But, Ross, you have to understand, your nice thing makes us feel about this big.
其实是令我们觉得这么渺小012---Actually, it makes us feel that big.
为什么  我不懂  我们好像怎么做  你们都觉得不对012---What? I don't understand. I mean, it's like we can't win with you guys.
假如你们觉得这么渺小  也许那不是我们的错012---If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.
也许那只是你们的感受012---Maybe that's just how you feel.
噢012---Oh.
你现在断定我们的感受   我们不该说起这件事的012---Now you're telling us how we feel. We never should have talked about this.
我要谢绝演唱会012---I'm gonna pass on the concert...
因为我现在没心情听混混012---...because I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
我也一样  我也是012---Me neither.  Me too.
各位  我们买了门票012---Guys, we bought the tickets.
那么你们有额外座位  让你们放皇冠等等012---Well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
你说的时候为何看着我012---Why did you look at me when you said that?
所以我想我们不能去了012---So I guess now we can't go.
拜托  你们想做什么就做  我们非得做什么都在一起吗012---Come on, do what you want. Do we always have to do everything together?
知道吗  你说得对012---You know what? You're right.
好  好012---Fine.  Fine.
好  好012---Fine.  Fine.
好  好的012---Fine. All right.
我们要去了012---We're gonna go.
还有六小时才开始  我们到时候再去012---It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
钱德  有012---Chandler? Yeah.
天啊012---Oh, jeez.
你准备好没  好了012---Are you ready?  Yes.
让我拿西装外套  跟你说我今天跟人上床了012---Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. Whoa, whoa.
什么  你今天跟人上床012---What? You had sex today?
由别人说这句话  听起来更酷012---Wow. It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it.
我很厉害  好吗  她拼命咬着嘴唇  才不会尖叫出来012---I was awesome, okay? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
哇噢012---Wow.
我知道我有阵子没做了  但我把那当成好的迹象012---Now, I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign.
还在过滤电话012---Still doing the screening thing?
我今天跟人上床了012---I had sex today.
我永远不必再接电话了012---I never have to answer that phone again.
哔声要来了  你知道该怎么做012---Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
嘿  巴伯  是我洁德  听着…012---Hey, Bob. It's Jade.
我只想告诉你  你前几天没出现  让我好受伤012---I just wanted to tell you I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day.
所以告诉你  我最后认识了一个男的012---And just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
我是巴伯012---Bob here.
喔  嗨012---Oh, hi.
你认识了别人吗012---So, uh, you met someone, huh?
是的  我认识了别人012---Yes. Yes, I did.
事实上  我两小时前跟他上了床012---In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.
那么他表现怎样012---So, uh, how was he?
哦012---Eh...
呃012---"Eh"?
巴伯  他根本比不上你012---Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.
我必须咬着嘴唇  才不会叫出你的名字012---I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
那令我真欣慰012---Well, that makes me feel so good.
过程很笨拙又颠簸012---It was just so awkward and bumpy.
颠簸012---Bumpy?
也许他有某种很酷的新风格  只是你不熟悉012---Maybe he had some kind of, uh, new cool style that you're not familiar with.
也许你只要习惯就好012---And, uh, maybe you have to get used to it.
没多少时间能让我习惯  你懂我意思吧012---There wasn't much time to get used to it... ...if you know what I mean.
你知道吗  我没办法乐在其中012---You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
对  我懂  这是我生日  我们应该全都在场012---Yeah, I know. It's my birthday. We all should be here.
那么走吧012---So let's go.
也许我们该留下来听一首歌012---Well, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
对  假如我们现在离开  对他们很没礼貌012---Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
再说  他们可能也过得很高兴012---You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
拜托  两位  再一次012---Come on, you guys. One more time.

蛮逊的  你们呢012---Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
我们的也很逊012---Yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.

除此之外  整个晚上实在没什么好提的012---Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
对  我们很想你们012---Yeah, we really missed you guys.
听着  我们想说  这整件事真是太傻了012---Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.
我们必须真的不让金钱之类的事  影响到…012---We just have to really, really not let stuff like money, get like...
那是草莓吗012---Is that a hickey?
不  我只是…012---Oh, ha, ha, no, I just...
我跌倒了012---I fell down.
倒在别人嘴唇上012---On someone's lips?
你的草莓从哪来的012---Where'd you get the hickey?
大概是派对或…  什么派对012---You know, a party or...  What party?
其实不太算派对  只是一群人聚在一起012---Well, it wasn't a party so much as a... A gathering of people.
有食物和音乐和…012---With food and music and...
和乐团012---And the band.
你们跟混混与自大狂一起参加派对012---You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
对  显然史提夫和混混很熟012---Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie are like this.
谁给你那草莓的012---Who gave you that hickey?
应该是其中一个自大狂的012---That would be the work of a Blowfish.
我不敢相信…012---I can't believe it. I can't believe this.
我们只是呆坐在家 试着猜乔伊比几根手指012---We're just sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers...
你们则在外面狂欢  玩得很开心012---...and you guys are out, like, partying and having fun and all:
〝自大狂  来吸我的脖子〞012---"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck."
听着  别怪我们  你们原本可以在场012---Hey, look, don't blame us. You guys could've been there.

太好了  公司打来的012---Oh, great. It's work.
我不知道该说什么  很遗憾我们赚得比你们多012---Look, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more than you.
但我们不打算觉得愧疚  我们是辛苦工作得到的012---But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
那我们没辛苦工作吗012---And we don't work hard?
对  我是摩妮卡  有人呼叫我012---Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I got a page.
我只是说 有时我们想做会比较花钱的事012---I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.

不对012---No.
里昂  等一下  大家安静012---Leon, wait. Shh! Guys.

那些牛排只是肉商的礼物012---Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.
那不是回扣012---That was not a kickback.

哔声要来了  你知道该怎么做012---Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
嗨  是我012---Hi, it's me.
听着  巴伯  也许我不该做这样的要求012---Listen, Bob, I'm probably way out of line here.
毕竟已经过了三年  你可能正在跟别人交往012---I mean, it has been three years, and you're probably seeing someone else now...
但是假如我们能共度一晚  看在往日的份上012---...but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake...
干柴烈火的一晚…012---One hot, steamy, wild night...
