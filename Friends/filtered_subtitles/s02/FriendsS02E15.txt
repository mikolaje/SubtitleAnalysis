菲比  他是我爸妈的朋友  他比我大二十岁012---He's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
那你不会再跟他见面012---So you're never gonna see him again?
也不能那么说012---Not never.
我约他明天帮我检查眼睛012---I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.

摩妮卡012---Monica?
我希望我吻你时  你叫的不是我妹妹的名字012---It would help when I'm kissing if you didn't shout my sister's name.

抱歉012---Sorry.
很好笑  为什么012---And that's funny why?
不是好笑012---Well, it's not. Uh...
我是说  抱歉  我想我很紧张012---I mean, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just nervous.
毕竟我面对的人是你012---I mean, it's you.
我们在一起了012---You know, it's us.  Mm.
我们越过那条线  这真的很重要012---I mean, we're crossing that line. It's sort of a big thing.
我知道这很重要  我只是不知道它很好笑012---Well, I know it's big. I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.
好吧012---Okay.
好  我没有摸你屁股012---Okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.

我只是在想  你刚刚摸了我的屁股012---I was thinking about when they were there the last time.
对不起  好吧  听着  我保证012---I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, look! Whoa, I promise.
我准备好了  我不会再笑  把你的手放回去012---I'm good. I won't laugh anymore. Put your hands back there.
不  你看  现在我没办法了  因为012---No, see, now I can't, because, uh...
我觉得太不自然了012---...I'm feeling too self-conscious.
摸一边就好  不了012---Just one cheek.  No. Ha.
感觉没了012---The moment's gone.
我可以背对你  让你摸  那还真是浪漫012---I'll back up into your hands.  That's romantic.
