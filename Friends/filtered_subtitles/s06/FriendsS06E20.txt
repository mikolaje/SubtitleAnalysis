"不行  我不会扔下你"012---"No, I won't leave you."
"别管我   我是机器人  我只是一台机器"012---"Don't worry about me. I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"
"不  对我来说  不是"   天哪012---"No, you're not. Not to me." Oh, my God.
怎么样   我真的太有天份了012---What? I am extremely talented.
对  你的确很棒啊012---Yeah. You're great. Yeah.
好  让我们接着从  我是说  我真的演得很带劲012---Okay, let's take it from... No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.
我觉得我演的也不错012---I thought I was pretty good too.
对  你跟个石头似的  你不如我012---Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.
我看就先这样吧012---You know what? I think that's enough for now.
我不想排练过头012---I don't want to be over-rehearsed. Ha-ha-ha.
没关系   我一个人自己演012---Fine. I'll do it without you!
没你或其它人  我照样演012---I don't need you or anybody else!
我会靠自己成功的012---I'm gonna make it on my own!
等着瞧   你们都给我等着瞧吧012---You'll see! You'll all see!
老友记  第六季  第20集  试镜风波012---Friends  S06E20  The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
这次  你要去试什么镜012---So, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
是一部新电视节目012---It's a new TV show. Yeah.
我的角色叫麦克麦可维利  也叫"麦克"012---I'm up for the part of Mac, Machiavelli, or "Mac"!

他是具有人工智能的012---He's a computerized, humanoid...
电子增强型的秘密特工012---...electronically enhanced secret enforcer.
简称 "吉事"012---Or, "C.H.E.E.S.E."
所以就是麦克与吉事   就是那剧名012---So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.? That's the title!
幸好缩写刚好是 "吉事"012---They really lucked out that the initials spell "cheese."
真是幸运啊012---That is lucky.
乔伊  要是你拿到这个角色012---Huh. Wait so Joey, if you get this, you're gonna be, like...
就有你自己成名的电视节目了012---...the star of your own TV show.
你就会被称为大吉事（汉堡）或是大麦克（麦香堡）都是你的最爱啊012---I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese" or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!
别抱太大期望   可能没那么好012---Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.

乔伊  你在说什么  你是个很棒的演员012---Joey, What are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
真的吗   你怎么能这么问012---You really think so? How can you even ask that question?
她真的漂亮   对  人也很好012---She's pretty. Yeah. And she's really nice too.
她教我怎么面对镜头012---She taught me all about, you know, how to work with cameras...
还有如何 "掩饰尴尬"012---...and "smell the fart" acting.
抱歉  什么  乔伊  抱歉012---I'm sorry, what'd you say? Joey, Excuse me?
就像你一下要背很多台词012---It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast...
有时得停下来想下一句012---...that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.
在你想的时候  要来个大停顿  表情专注故作严肃012---So while you're thinking of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense.
就像这样来掩饰012---You know, like this:
好  懂了012---Oh. Okay.
该我了   该我了012---Here's my scene! Here's my scene!
华勒斯太太  我是雷莫瑞医生  令妹的神经外科医生012---Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.

我演艾尔帕西诺的屁股012---I play Al Pacino's butt.
怎么样  他进去淋浴  然后我就是他的屁股012---All right? He goes into the shower and then, I'm his butt.
天哪   别这样  伙计们012---Oh, my God. Come on, you guys.
这是一部艾尔帕西诺主演的真正的电影  是部大制作012---This is a real movie and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
的确很棒  你当之无愧   努力了这么久012---No, it's terrific. You deserve this after all your years of struggling...
终于可以 "屁美" 别人了012---...you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
好  你们尽管笑吧  我不在乎  这是我千载难逢的机会012---Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care. This is a big break for me.
没错   你说得很对012---No, you're right, it is. Yeah.
你会邀请我们去看你 "精屁"的演出吗012---So, you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
好  我要走了  祝我好运012---All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.
加油  加油  我们都祝你好运012---Good luck, good luck We all wish you good luck
随便啦012---Yeah, whatever.
该你了012---It's your turn.
我们在玩吗012---Oh, are we playing this?
嘿  嘿  试镜还顺利吗012---Hey. Hey. How did the audition go?
糟透了  我把台词都念错了  我不该当演员的012---Terrible. I messed up every line. I shouldn't even be an actor.
等等  你又在假装不顺利了012---Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well...
其实很顺利吧012---...but it really did go well?
对  你们上过当了吗  完全被骗了012---Yeah, did I fool you? Totally!
所以  一切很顺利   顺利的不得了012---So, it did go well? It went amazingly well!
太好了  太好了012---Great. That's great.
只剩下我和另外两个人  天哪012---Yeah-yeah, It's down to me and two other guys. Oh, my God.
而且我认识他们两个  那两个人都很厉害012---And I know both of them, and they're really good.
其中一个就是在过敏广告里  被巨无霸花朵012---One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always being chased...
追来追去的人  我好喜欢那个人012---...by those big flowers. Oh, I love that guy.
你在干什么012---Oh. What are you doing?
我在干什么012---What am I doing?
我好紧张  明天下午5点才要复试012---I'm so nervous, you know? The callback isn't till tomorrow at 5.
我感到头都要炸了012---I feel like my head's gonna explode.
对啊   你的头早该爆了012---Well, it is overdue.
放心  好吗  你一定没问题012---Don't worry, okay? You're gonna be fine.
对   但压力太大了012---Yeah, but it's so much pressure.
很抱歉   但你们所面临的和我不一样012---I mean no offense, but what you guys all do is very different.
我不知道你们能不能体会012---I don't know if you'd understand.
是啊  我们的工作都没有压力012---Yeah, none of the rest of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
是的  我知道现在几点了012---Yes, I know what time it is...
但是我正在看财务报表   不满意012---...but I'm looking at the WENIS and I'm not happy.
好了  我在撕生菜012---Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
很脏吗  不  放心  我会洗干净的012---Uh-huh? Is it dirty? No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
不必了   我喜欢它脏点012---Don't. I like it dirty.
你决定就好012---That's your call.
你接下来要做什么012---So, uh, what are you going to do next?
我想我要切蕃茄了012---Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatoes.
它们结实吗012---Are they firm?
还可以012---They're all right.
你确定它们还没坏掉   你确定它们没有坏透嘛012---You sure they haven't gone bad? You sure they're not very, very bad?
没有  真的  它们还好012---No, really. They're okay.
你会把它们切得很漂亮吗012---You gonna slice them up real nice?
其实  我想把它们切成条012---Ahem. Actually, I was gonna do them julienne.
我要走了012---I'm out of here.
摩妮卡  我要辞职  我刚帮了一个81岁的老太太系上皮带012---Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...
而她竟然根本没买012---...and she didn't even buy it.
我要辞职   就这样   我现在就要跟老板说012---I'm telling you I'm quitting. That's it. I'm talking to my boss right now.
没错  我马上就去  马上就去012---Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

他来按摩  本来挺好的  可是后来012---Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until...
天哪012---Oh, my God.
然后突然间  他动手动脚也不算啥了012---And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.
他有没有   他那儿用来搭帐棚都绰绰有余了012---Was it? Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under there.
你吃了我的三明治012---You ate my sandwich.
纯粹是个失误   谁都可能会犯012---It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
真的吗012---Oh, really?
你别激动012---Now calm down.
到我办公室来找   垃圾桶里可能还有012---Come look in my office. Some of it may still be in the trash.
什么  它太大了012---What? Well, it was quite large.
大部分都被我扔了012---I had to throw most of it away.
你扔掉了我的三明治012---You threw my sandwich away?
我的三明治012---My sandwich?
我的三明治012---My sandwich!
我很想拿到这个角色   你知道吗012---It's just, I want this part so much, you know?
要是我没拿到  我就再也不吃起司通心面012---If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat macaroni and cheese again.
不  我没那样说  那不算的012---No, I didn't say that. That doesn't count.
别这样  各位  我又不是搬到欧洲去012---Come on, guys. It's not like I moved to Europe.
我只是搬到对面012---I just moved across the hall.
假如摩妮卡不会过敏012---And we would have you over all the time...
你们随时能过来012---...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.
没错   我骗不了你们012---You're right, I could never lie to you.
她讨厌你们012---She hates you.
我该接吗012---Should I get that? Ha-ha-ha.
喂  不  乔伊现在不在012---Hello? Uh, no, Joey's not here right now.
你要留言吗012---Can I take a message?
好  试镜从5点改到2点半012---Yeah, okay. So the audition's been moved from 5 to 2:30?
好的  再见012---Okay, great. Bye.
你还没穿衣服   我又光着身子了012---Aren't you dressed yet? Am I naked again?
我们15分钟后要去见我爸妈012---We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
好  我只是在跟他们聊天  你看他们嘛012---Okay. I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them.

我是说该有多过瘾啊   跟足球一样过瘾012---I mean, how crazy would that be? As crazy as soccer?
喂012---Hello?
你在说什么  不是5点才试镜嘛012---What are you talking about? The audition's not till 5.
没有人告诉我啊012---Well, nobody told me.
你跟谁说的012---Who'd you talk to?
没事012---Never mind.
你是说你没有看到我的留言吗012---You mean you didn't get it from this?
那个患有敏感症的家伙入选了   谢谢你啊012---The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.
也许我们能补救   你知道吗012---Well, maybe we can fix it, you know?
也许我们能送巨无霸大花去吓吓他012---Maybe we can send him some big, big flowers and scare him!
你怎么能这样对我   钱德012---How could you do this to me Chandler?!
这个角色能扭转我的整个演艺生涯012---This part could've turned my whole career around.
是我的错  对不起  我真的搞砸了012---I messed up, okay? I'm sorry. I really messed up.
你都已经不住在这里了  干嘛要接听我的电话012---You don't even live here anymore. Why'd you answer my phone?
我可以录音的  是我买给你的012---I have a machine! Which I bought for you.
还教你怎么用   你还以为它是复印机012---Taught you how to use it. You thought it was a copier.
我愿意尽全力挽救这个错误   我一定会做  知道吗012---If there was anything I could do, I would do it, okay?
但是人起码可以犯一次错错  不是吗012---But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
他可以送我录影机  或是一对高尔夫球杆012---He could have gotten me a VCR. He could have gotten me golf clubs.
可是  他偏偏要送我这个  吓跑女人012---But no, he has to get me the woman repeller.
看着碍眼  戴着碍事儿的东西012---The eyesore from the Liberace House of Crap!
没那么严重啦  你当然说得容易了012---it's not that bad. Oh, yeah, easy for you to say.
你又不必戴着  被某个老粗淘汰的金饰到处跑012---You don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T Collection.
钱德  钱德012---Chandler. Chandler.
我真同情戴这个手饰的人  真的012---I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!
我真同情戴这个  你好012---I pity the fool that--
嘿012---Hi.
你昨晚迟到后   凯西和我聊了起来  然后012---When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking and...
事情演变到后来就012---...one thing led to another and...
就什么  你跟她上床012---And what? Did you sleep with her?
没有  我只是吻了她  什么  那更糟012---No! No, I just kissed her. What? That's even worse!
怎么会更糟   我不知道  反正都一样012---How is that worse? I don't know! But it's the same!
你说得对  我无话可说  我太过分了012---You're right, I have no excuses. I was totally over the line.
"过分"012---"Over the line?"
你根本就过分到  连过分见到你012---You're so far past the line that you can't even see the line!
都会说你过分012---Yeah, the line is a dot to you!
我不奢望你马上原谅我012---Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me.
但你也不完美   你也做过错误的判断012---But you're not perfect. You've made some errors in judgment too.
举个例子012---Name one.
怎么回事012---What happened?
他答应不拿沙发椅的012---Aw, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
怎么回事   你怎么会被关进去呢012---What the hell happened? How were you locked in?
我们的东西呢012---And where the hell's all of our stuff?
有一个人过来看柜子012---Well, this guy came by to look at the unit...
他说他不相信能塞下一个大人012---...and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man.
所以  你就自愿进去012---So you got in voluntarily?
我想把柜子卖出去嘛012---I was trying to make a sale!
要是让我碰上他  你猜我会怎样012---Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, you know what I'm gonna do?
把屁股翘起来012---Bend over?
她来了012---There's Lorraine.
记住  不准交换  美女是你的  失恋女是我的012---Okay, now remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
嗨  乔伊  嘿012---Hi, Joey. Hey.

她在寄放外套012---She's checking her coat.
乔伊   我要去洗个手012---Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
你帮我叫一杯白酒   帮珍妮丝叫一杯红酒012---Will you get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice?
珍妮丝012---Janice?
珍妮丝012---Janice?
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
乔伊的栽缝吃我豆腐012---Joey's tailor took advantage of me.
什么012---What?
不可能   我找他做了12年衣服012---No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
拜托啦   他说要量裤管内侧012---He said he was gonna do my inseam...
然后他的手一路摸上来   然后就012---...then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
怎样012---What?
包住了012---Cupping.
裤子就是那样量的012---That's how they do pants!
罗斯  你告诉他012---Ross, will you tell him?
裤子不都是那样量的  是啊  是啊  在监狱里012---Isn't that how a tailor measures pants? Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
叫你举一个就好012---I said name one!
我居然这么粗心  我真白痴  别再自责了012---I can't believe I did this. What an idiot. Stop beating yourself up.
人都会犯错   这是难免的012---People make mistakes. These things happen.
你没有忘记帮我记留言吧012---There aren't any messages you've forgotten to give me, are there?
显然  你不太会记留言012---Apparently, you're not very good at it.
你们觉得他会原谅我吗  当然会012---Do you think he'll ever forgive me? Of course he will.
钱德  但最重要的是  你得原谅自己012---Chandler, the most important thing is that you forgive yourself.
其实我已经原谅自己了  这么快012---You know what, I kind of have. Already?
你犯的错蛮严重的012---That was pretty bad, what you did.
你知道吗  他会原谅你的012---You know what? He will forgive you.
我接电话时都会带便条纸  以防万一  好啦012---And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone, just in case. Okay.
你没看到他气成什么样子012---You didn't see how mad he was, you know?
他一定会原谅你的012---I'm sure he will forgive you.
我们都有这种经验  吵架  和解012---Look, we've all been there, you know? You fight, you make up.
就是这样012---That's the way it works.
感情破裂  往往是两个人的错012---It took two people to break up this relationship!
对  你和复印店那个女的012---Yeah! You and that girl from the copy place...
你昨天表明愿意负责012---...which yesterday you took full responsibility for!
我不知道我负的是什么责012---I didn't know what I was taking responsibility for, okay?
我没把信看完012---I didn't finish the whole letter.
什么   我睡着了012---What? I fell asleep.
你睡着了012---You fell asleep?
当时是早上5点半012---It was 5:30 in the morning.
你一废话就废话了十八页012---And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
正反面都写满了012---Front and back!
还有 "你得"是指 "你必须"012---And by the way? Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."
"你的"是所有格012---Y-O-U-R means "your."
我居然想要跟你复合012---Y'know I can't believe I thought of getting back together with you.
我们根本就完了012---We are so over!
无所谓012---Fine by me!
顺便告诉你   那种事并不常见012---And hey! just so you know, it's not that common...
不是男人都会那样   没有什么大不了的012---...it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal!
我就知道012---I knew it!
你没有权利和他约会   这真是太荒谬了012---You had no right to go out with him. That is the most ridiculous--
你出卖了我   我没有出卖你012---You sold me out! I did not sell you out!
不  你出卖了  你当然出卖了我   你还让我说话吗012---Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me-Would you let me talk?
你弹了我的额头吗012---Did you just flick me?
你不让我说完   我只是想  我很012---Okay, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was just-Ow!
够了  够了012---Stop it! Ow! Ow!
住手  住手012---stop. Stop.
好  不要这样  不要啊012---All right. No, let's not do this. No!
想想快乐的事   不012---Happy thoughts. No!
别打了012---Stop it! Oh! Oh!
好了   我就要踢屁股了012---Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!
痛  痛  我知道012---Ow. Ow. Ow. I know, I know.
好  你们住手  我就放手012---All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.
好吧  好吧012---Fine. Fine.
这样多好012---There we go.
你知道吗   如果在监狱  你们就是我的喽罗了012---Ha. You know what? If we were in prison, you guys would be like my bitches.
好吗   兄弟   你瞧瞧怎么样012---Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
你敢藏我的衣服    我就把你衣服都穿上012---You hide my clothes? I'm wearing everything you own.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
看啊  我是钱德   我还能再多穿点衣服吗012---Look at me, I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?
或许我要去玩野战游戏012---Maybe if I wasn't going "commando."
穿这么多衣服真热   我最好别蹲什么弓箭步012---Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. 
乔伊012---Joey?

喂012---Hello?
乔伊现在不在   我可以帮你留言吧012---No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message. I think.
他还有机会得到那个角色   真是个好消息012---He's still got a chance for the part? Oh, That's great news!
很明显不是因为  那位被狗咬伤的演员而幸灾乐祸012---Well, no, obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.
