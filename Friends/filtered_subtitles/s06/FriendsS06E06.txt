好012---Okay. Aah.
我要搬过去了  房租就给你缴了012---Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you are gonna be in charge of paying the rent.
也对  什么时候要缴  每月1号012---Right, and when is that due? First of the month.
是每个月吗012---And that's every month?
不是  你想住的月份才要缴012---No, just the months you actually want to live here.
啊012---Ah.
这是电话费012---Okay, here's the phone bill.
天啊  要死了012---Oh, my God!
那是电话号码012---That's our phone number.
是我突然决定要搬走的012---Look, I know I kind of sprung this whole me-moving-out-on-you thing.
所以我先帮你挡一阵子吧  不  不  不  不行012---So why don't I just cover you for a while? No, no. No way.
乔伊崔比亚尼不接受施舍012---Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...
再也不了012---...anymore.
这不是施舍  乔伊  不行  别再说了012---It's not charity, Joe. No, forget it.
谢谢  但我不想再拿你的钱了012---Okay? I mean, thanks, but I'm done taking money from you.
我可以照顾自己  还有什么012---All right? I can take care of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
好  这是电费012---Okay, uh, here's the electric bill.
用个电要这么多钱  对啊012---This is how much we pay for electric? Well, yeah.
其他的帐单  待会儿再看了012---So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then?
老友记  第六季  第6集  最后一夜012---Friends  S06E06  The One With Joey's Porsche
那乔伊得搬出去吗012---So is Joey gonna have to give up the apartment?
希望不用  我想给他钱  但是他不收012---I hope not. I tried to offer him money, but he wouldn't take it.
你觉得他需要多少012---How much do you think he needs?
我想1千5应该够他活几个月了012---I figure $1500 would cover him for a few months, you know...
但我得骗他收下  免得伤到他的自尊012---...but I have to trick him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride.
你怎么不雇他当演员啊012---Yeah. Well, why don't you hire him as an actor?
你可以叫他装扮成演短剧   怎样都行012---You could have him dress up and put on little skits whenever you want.
那样对自尊确实有帮助012---Well, that would help the pride thing.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你真是响当当啊  明天要不要搬来跟我住012---Wow, you look great. Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow?
好啊  好012---okay. okay
你们女生今晚要做什么012---What do you girls have planned for tonight?
与其难过我和瑞秋要分开012---Instead of being sad that tonight's my last night with Rachel...
还不如我们出去吃饭庆祝012---...we thought we'd go out and celebrate:
瑞秋要搬去跟菲比住012---Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.
还有我的生日  今天不是你的生日012---And also my birthday. Ha, ha.It's not your birthday.
你这样讲好恶劣012---What a mean thing to say.
我就不会戳穿你012---I would never tell you it was not your birthday.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们男生有什么节目吗012---Hey, so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
与其一起打混   我们决定什么也不做012---Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
今晚是《尼克队》开慕战012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Knicks' season opener tonight.
我以为你们想来我家看012---I thought maybe you guys would come and watch it.
不知道  罗斯012---I don't know, Ross.
我怕你又吹嘘  说你放弃打球012---Not if you talk about how you gave up basketball...
去当古生物学家了012---...to become a paleontologist.
我本来就放弃了打球  去当古生物学家012---I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
菲比  我在想  你还没换衣服012---Pheebs, I was wondering. You're not dressed yet?
我们15分钟后就要去玩了012---We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
而且  早1分钟都不行012---Well, and clearly, not a minute sooner.
瑞秋  你都打包好了吧  拜托  你说是012---Rachel, you are packed, though, right? I mean, please tell me you're packed.
我当然打包好了  莫妮卡  别紧张啊012---Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax.
我只是想问问菲比  我该穿什么012---I wanted to ask Phoebe for her opinion on what I should wear.
天哪  我真是一刻也不得闲012---My God, I cannot get a minute of peace.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
摩妮卡会宰了你012---Monica's just gonna kill you.
我知道012---I know.
你穿这样蛮适合惨死的012---What you're wearing is fine for that.
你没打包012---You're not packed!
你根本没打包012---You're not packed even a little bit.
惊喜012---Surprise.
什么  你别发飚啊  是这样的012---What? Don't get mad, because, look, this is what happened.
我开始打包  然后想到  "我在干嘛"012---So I started packing, and then I realized, "What am I doing?"
我最不会打包了  对吧012---I am lousy at packing, right?
但你最爱打包了012---But you love packing.
所以做为我的临别赠礼012---So as a gift to you on our last night...
我可以当总指挥012---I'll be coordinator.
天啊  对不起  我没帮你准备礼物012---Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't get you anything.
哦012---Oh.
大家都要帮忙  菲比  你可以帮忙吧012---Look, everybody has to help. Phoebe, you can help, can't you?
我有事012---I have plans.
你是跟我们有约  没错012---You have plans with us. That's right.
钱德可以贴纸箱  罗斯封箱  乔伊搬东西012---All right. Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things.
菲比  去通知男生帮忙  好012---Tell the guys they have to help out. Okay.
天哪   谢谢你012---Okay. My God, thank you.
快逃   摩妮卡要叫你们收东西   她把工作都分好了012---Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack. She's got jobs for everyone.
我是躲不掉了  你们快逃012---Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves.
那最好了012---Okay.
搬家公司11个小时后会来   瑞秋还没打包012---The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed.
每个人都得帮忙  钱德012---Now, everybody has to help. Chandler--
不行  我和乔伊有事012---No, I have plans with Joey.
你不是说你们没事   这是最后一次了嘛012---I thought you said you were doing nothing. Yes, but for the last time.
好吧  罗斯012---Okay, fine. Now, Ross--
我没办法帮忙   为什么012---Oh, but I can't do it. Why not?
班要来   因为班要来012--- I’ve got Ben. Because, because I’ve got Ben.
都快8点了  他都快上床了  他在哪里012---It's almost 8:00, it's almost past his bedtime. Where is he?
他去参加晚宴了012---He's at a dinner party.
他真的要来吗   到时候我能看得到你家了012---Is he really coming? Because I can see into your apartment.
当然是真的012---Of course he is. Uh,
难道我会拿儿子当借口012---You think I'd just use my son as an excuse?
你把我当成哪种爸爸了012---What kind of father do you think I am?
好吧  对不起012---All right. Sorry.
我得回家做个班的复制品了012---I gotta go make a fake Ben.
来了  室友时代最后的彼萨012---Here it is. Our last pizzas together as roommates.
我不知道你会买披萨  我叫了中国菜012---I wish I'd known you were gonna do that. I ordered Chinese.
没关系012---Oh. Oh, that's okay.
其实这样蛮好的012---Hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice. You know?
我们最后的两人晚餐  我  带我祖先的食物012---Our last dinner together. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors...
你  带你祖先的食物012---...you, the food of yours.
乔伊  我有个比较奇怪的想法012---Say, Joe, I had a strange idea for what to do on our last night.
我们来打几盘   赌钱如何012---What do you say we play a little, uh, foosball for money?
你疯了  自97年伤后复出  你就没赢过我012---Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury-plagued '97 season.
你拿钱送我还比较快012---It'd be easier if you'd just give me your money.
是啊012---Yes, it would.
你觉得50元如何012---Ahem. What do you say to $50?
好  赌了  好  开赛012---Okay, you're on. Okay, let's play.
世纪之战   意大利对012---The big game. Italy versus...
当然是中国队012---...China, apparently.
看  是直排轮鞋012---Oh, look, it's the Rollerblades.
天哪012---Oh, God.
记得我们什么时候买的吗012---You remember when we got these?
不记得012---No.
那你应该不在012---Oh, I guess you weren't there.
喂  我们说过要开心的012---You guys, we said we were gonna have fun.
别这样  记不记得那次012---Come on. Hey, ha, ha, remember the time...?
你们不记得吗012---You don't remember?
对不起  菲比  要搬走了我真的很难过012---Sorry, Pheebs. I guess I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.
我会很想你012---I'm gonna miss you so much.
其实  不必这么难过012---Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though, you know?
别再想你们会想念对方了012---Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other...
想想你们不会怀念的事012---...you should, like, think about some of the things you're not gonna miss.
我觉得没有012---I don't think there's anything.
拜托  总会有两件012---Come on, there's gotta be something.
没有  她太完美了012---Nope. She's perfect.
我有一件012---I have one.
很好  你先说012---Good. Great. Okay, you can go first.
我不会想念012---Uh, well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact...
你不准我把留言笔拿走012---...that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Ha, ha.
说得好  摩妮卡  你有吗012---That's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything?
瑞秋会把留言笔拿走吗012---You know, does Rachel move the phone pen?
有时候会012---Aw, sometimes. Ha, ha.
其实  每次都会012---Always, actually.
这就对了  这样不是好多了012---Good. There you go. Doesn't everyone feel better?
不只是留言笔012---Not just the phone pen. 
我老是收不到留言012---I never get my messages.
你收到啦012---You get your messages.
趁你在沙发上睡着012---Well, I don't think it counts if you have to read them off your hand...
去看你的手背应该不算012---...after you've fallen asleep on the couch.
那你是没接到谁的留言  钱德012---So you missed a message from who? Chandler?
还是你妈012---Or your mom?
还是钱德012---Or Chandler?
还是你妈012---Or your mom?
太好了  成功了  没人难过了012---Great, it worked. No one's sad. Heh.
万岁012---Yes. Ah.
我又赢了  你已经欠我5百了012---I win again. Ha, ha, that's, like, 500 bucks you owe me. Woo-hoe!
5百元了012---Man. Five hundred dollars.
5百元值很多电012---That is a lot of electricity, huh? Woo-hoo!
我得买点吃的012---Ooh, I gotta buy some food.
给我捞本的机会  骤死赛012---Okay, okay. Give me a chance to win my money back. Sudden death...
一球  1千012---...one goal, $1000.
真的  当然012---You serious? Oh, yes.
好012---0Key.
准备欠我钱吧   好012---Get ready to owe me. Okay.
来吧  好了吗012---Okay, here we go. Ready?
不  不  不012---No, no, no! No, no, no!
要想赢我012---one can beat me.
看吧  所以只有小假人可以出脚012---See, now that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking.
哈罗012---Hello?
罗斯  看吧  还有别人会打来012---Oh, hi, Ross. See, other people call me.
你老哥  了不起012---Ooh, your brother. Score.
怎样  我跟班在一起012---What's up? I'm here with Ben.
想跟你问个好012---Thought we'd say hi.
叫他听  班  跟摩妮卡姑姑打招呼012---Put him on. Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.
看来他现在不想说话012---Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now.
不过他在笑012---Uh, he's smiling, though.
好  待会再聊012---Okay, talk to you later.
我觉得你们难过时比较好012---I think it was better when you guys were sad.
记得这双直排轮鞋吗012---Hey, oh, remember the Rollerblades? Oh.
你知道我还不会想念什么  "我是摩妮卡012---You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica.
我一天刷十七次马桶  有人在上也照刷"012---I wash the toilets 17 times a day, even if people are on it."
"我是瑞秋  我的毛衣太紧了吗  不会012---"Hi, I'm Rachel. ls my sweater too tight? No?
那我得洗一洗  让它缩水"012---Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it."
"我是摩妮卡  都没有有趣的人给我留言"012---"I'm Monica. I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever."
我会打给她012---Hey, I call her.
"天哪  我爱罗斯  我恨罗斯   我爱罗斯   我恨罗斯"012---"Oh, my God. I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross."
天哪  我交不到男朋友012---"Oh, my God. I can't find a boyfriend.
干脆到对面去  看到谁就上谁"012---So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there."
如果想赶去餐厅  就得快了012---Yeah, we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.
还是不能玩012---Still broken?
真是烂透了012---It sucks, man.
你在这里的最后一晚   我却失去两样最重要的东西012---Your last night here, and I lose the two most important things in my life,
手足球桌012---The foosball table...
和5百元012---...and $500.
有别的办法可以把钱赢回去  要不要012---Well, you know, there are other ways you can win back your money,how about a little uh.
玩21点  我不喜欢玩21点012---a little Blackjack? Ah, not my game.
那就玩  我们可以玩个新游戏012---Okay, uh, how about--you know what? We could play a new game.
新游戏  很好玩  叫什么名字012---A new game. It's fun. What's it called?
杯牌012---Cups.
我不会玩杯牌  我教你  来嘛  简单又好玩012---I don't know how to play Cups. I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, really easy and really, really fun..
好吧  好  拿牌012---All right. Okay, here you go.
我有两张皮蛋  你呢012---I have two queens. What do you have?
二和五  你赢了  50元012---A two and a five. Whoa, you win. Fifty dollars.
真的  没错  再玩  好了吗012---Really? Oh, yeah. Okay, let's play again. Ready?
你是什么牌  四和九012---What have you got? A four and a nine.
开玩笑  不会吧012---You're kidding, right?
怎么了  那是满杯012---No. Why? Well, that's a full cup.
我真是杯牌高手012---Damn, I am good at Cups.
我不要跟她说话012---I'm not talking to her.
总得有人先开口啊012---One of you has to take the first step...
这个人应该是你   因为她要搬走012---...and it should be you because she's the one who's leaving.
她比较难过012---It's harder for her.
也许吧012---Maybe you're right.
但她嘲笑我的留言笔012---She made fun of my phone pen.
我知道  我也觉得很过分012---I know. I took it hard too.
瑞秋  刚才的事我很012---Listen, Rachel, I feel bad about what happened--
你在干什么  把东西拿出来012---What are you doing? I'm unpacking.
什么  我不搬了  这幅画正吗012---What? I'm not moving. Is that picture straight?
离左边差了十万八千里012---It needs to go about 2O blocks to the left.
你知道吗012---Hey, you know what?
是你要改变  跟钱德同居012---You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler.
你才应该走  为什么要我走012---You should be the one to go! Why do I have to leave?
因为这是我的房子  它也是我的  还有呢012---Because It's my apartment! Well, it's mine too. What else you got?
还有就是  你要搬出去012---How about: You're moving!
不  不  不  要  要  要012---No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes.
好了  摩妮卡012---Okay, Monica--
这样太可笑了012---This is ridiculous.
我们应该帮你打包012---We should be packing you.
你们谈得怎样  很好  摩妮卡要搬走012---Hey, how you guys doing? Great. Monica's moving.
我才没有012---I am not!
是吗  那为什么你的东西都在这个箱子里012---Oh, really? Well, how come all your stuff is in this box?
好  我知道是怎么回事了012---Okay, you guys, you guys, I think I know what's going on here.
喂  停012---Okay? You guys? Stop!
你们是假装生气   就怕相互舍不得012---I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that will make it easier to leave.
其实内心深处  你们还是很难过的012---But deep down, you're still really sad. Deep, deep down.
不  菲比  我很生气   最最最深处012---No, Phoebe, I am mad! Well, deep, deep, deep down.
我就是很生气012---Yeah, I'm just mad.
那就继续追吧012---Then keep running.
你赢了012---You win.
你是什么牌  不重要  什么都比不上012---What did you have? Doesn't matter. Nothing beats...
三和六012---...a three and a six.
那叫D罩杯012---That, my friend, is "D Cup."
你目前为止  赢了多少012---Okay, now, how much have you won so far?
哇  7百  不是正好7百吧012---Wow. Seven hundred. Not 700 exactly?
是啊  再加7百012---Yeah. Heh. Double it.
什么  在杯牌里   一旦赢到7百012---What? Yeah, see, in Cups, once you get $700...
就得自动加码012---...you have to double it.
真的  规则又不是我订的012---Really? Hey, I didn't make up the rules.
拿到加码奖金后  你可以拿一张牌012---Okay, so now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get, uh, one card.
那张牌有可能值1百元  让你总共赢得1千5012---Now, that one card could be worth $100, which brings your total to 1500.
哇啊  不  不  不012---Ooh. No, no, no.
别太兴奋   除非你拿到  不会吧012---Don't get too excited, because that's not gonna happen unless you get the-No way.
这是最后一箱衣服012---Well, this is the last box of your clothes.
我会在上面注明  "你在想什么"012---I'm just gonna label it "What were you thinking?"
有意思  我正想到对面  在钱德身上那样写012---Funny, I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
两位  不是我想雪上加霜  但是012---Okay, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but...
我不想跟瑞秋住了012---...I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore.
什么  你们对对方太刻薄012---What? You're just so mean to each other.
我不想跟瑞秋翻脸   我还是喜欢你012---And I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you.
没关系   菲比  因为我不搬了012---Well, Phoebe, that's fine because I'm not moving.
菲比  你一定要收留她012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Phoebe, you gotta take her.
我说了很多她的坏话012---You know, I know I said some bad stuff...
但瑞秋也有一些好室友的特质012---...but Rachel does have some qualities that make her a good roommate.
是吗  像什么  摩妮卡012---Oh, really? Like what, Monica?
她有几千双靴子012---You know how she has 147,000 pair of boots?
真是个好的开始012---Oh, yeah, good start, Mon.
她会借给你穿012---She lets you borrow them. Yeah.
然后你再用你的大脚把它撑大012---And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet.
你想睡路边吗  天气要变冷了012---Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold.
她有一大堆目录012---She gets tons of catalogs...
她会把我会喜欢的部分折起来012---...and, um, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks I'd like.
还有呢012---What else? Uh...
我洗澡时012---When I take a shower...
她会在镜子上留言给我012---...she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
那倒是012---Yeah, I do. I do do that.
真好  我喜欢浴室里有东西可读012---That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
我在沙发上看书看到睡着012---When I fall asleep on the couch after reading...
她会帮我盖毯子012---...she covers me over with a blanket.
我不希望你冷到012---Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold.
我说我要跟钱德同居时012---And when I told her I was gonna be moving in with Chandler...
她非常支持我012---...she was really supportive.
你真好012---You were so great.
让我无后顾之忧012---You made it so easy.
现在你要走了012---And now you have to leave.
我得跟一个男生住了012---And I have to live with a boy!
不会有事的012---It's gonna be fine.
瑞秋  我真希望你赶快搬进来012---Okay, Rachel. Now I can't wait to live with you.
而且我们应该012---You know what we should do?
把摩妮卡也一起带来012---Bring Monica, and then we can all live there together.
一定会很好玩012---We'll have so much fun!
但是她要跟钱德住012---But, honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
也对012---Oh, that's right.
你还是要跟他住吗012---You're still set on that?
应该吧012---Kind of.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
哈罗  嘿  摩妮卡012---Hello? Hey, Mon.
打包顺利吗012---How's the packing going?
班  他很好  他就在  妈呀012---Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh, my God.
把头从衣服里伸出来  儿子012---Get your head out of your shirt there, son.
什么012---What?
对  是南瓜  我过去帮忙012---Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
嘿012---Hey.
怎么了  罗斯和我帮忙打包012---What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack...
休息时  我跟他玩杯牌输了1千5012---...took a little break. I lost $1500 to him in Cups.
玩杯牌  怎么会输那么多012---Wha--? How did you lose at Cups?
跟你输的方式一样012---The same way you lost.
我先拿到老K和皮蛋  砰  罗斯拿到2和3012---I started outwith the king and the queen. Barn. Ross gets a two and a three.
然后我拿到杰克和老K  砰  罗斯拿到4和5012---Then I get a jack and a king. Boom. Ross gets a four and five.
罗斯拿到满杯   D罩杯012---Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup...
和自动加码   我连半副杯牌都凑不到012---...the sitting-down bonus. Meanwhile, I didn't even get a half cup. Nothing.
天哪012---Oh, man.
他之前也没玩过012---He never played before either.
我觉得玩杯牌都靠新手的牌运012---You know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
好  我们再玩一把012---Let's just play one more hand. One more hand.
不要  我1毛钱也输不起了  我是说真的012---No, no more. I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time.
事实上  我要送你一样东西012---In fact, look. There's-I wanna give you something, okay?
现在先送  免得我因为赌债拿去当给你012---And let me give it to you now before I pawn it for Cups money.
我要把大白狗送给你012---Now, I want you to have the big, white dog...
谢谢你这些年来的照顾012---...as a-Kind of a thank-you for being such a great roommate.
我不能收  你很喜欢这个雕像012---I can't take the big, white dog. You love it.
他不是雕像   他是活的012---It's "him." Not "it."
要是我跟你买呢012---Well, what if I bought it from you, you know?
你可以以合理的价格卖给我012---And then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.
1千5如何012---Say $1500?
等一下  我知道你想干嘛了012---Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here.
你又想塞钱给我012---You're trying to give me money again.
我什么时候塞钱给你了012---When did I try to give you money?
之前看帐单的时候012---Before, over there with the bills.
你想施舍我  我说不要  你也就算了012---You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it.
然后  我们开心地度过最后一晚012---Okay, then we had a nice last night together.
说笑  赌钱  谁也没塞钱给谁012---We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money.
现在你  突然又想来这套012---Now, out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again.
我只是想帮助你   我想确定你的生活没有问题012---I'm just trying to help you out, okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
我会没问题的  听着  钱德012---I will be okay. Look, Chandler.
你不能老觉得我无法照顾自己012---You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself, okay?
我不会怀念你借钱给我012---Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me outwith money.
我唯一会怀念的012---The only thing I'm gonna miss...
就是你012---...is you.
现在还有这只狗012---And now the dog.
嘿012---Hey.
到了后打电话给我  好吗  好的012---Call me when you get there, okay? Okay.
我真的会很想你012---I'm really gonna miss you.
钥匙要还你012---Oh, I have your key.
拿去   谢谢012---Here you go. Thanks.
天哪   多好笑  再过几小时就会见面了012---Oh, God, this is silly. I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours.
再见  房子012---Bye,house.
再见012---'Bye-bye. Bye.
嘿012---Hey.
她真的走了  我知道012---She really left. I know.
谢谢你  不客气  室友012---Thank you. No problem, roomie.
我可以问你个问题吗  当然可以012---Can I ask you a question? Sure.
那只狗怎么会在这里012---What the hell is that dog doing here?
我捏造了杯牌   这样好塞钱给乔伊012---I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
现在你想把钱要回去  没错012---And now you want that money back? Exactly.
钱德  你以为我是白痴吗012---Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for?
没有那种牌  那是我捏造的012---It's not a real game. I made it up.
很遗憾  你输了钱  但我赢得光明正大012---I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square.
游戏是假的012---At a fake game!
如果你想赢一点回去012---Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back...
我愿意陪着你玩  但我必须警告你012---...I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you.
我是杯牌高手012---I am very good at Cups.
好  你上次玩  有出现杯盘牌吧012---Okay, now, I assume the saucer card came up when you played last?
没有012---No. Hmm.
看看这次会不会出现012---Let's see if it comes up this time.
