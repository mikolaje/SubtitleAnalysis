嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我想知道012---Listen, uh...
你们觉得我追得到吉宁吗012---do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
我们讨论过这件事了012---Honey, we have been through this before!
对啊  别折磨自己了012---Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
她已经明确表示不可能了012---She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
那我刚刚吻了她012---All right, then. I guess I shouldn't get too excited about the fact...
也不该太兴奋了012---...that I just kissed her!
真的假的啊  太好了012---Are you serious? That's great!
还得观察012---Yeah, well, we'll see.
你吻了她012---You kissed her?
吻得相当火热了012---Oh, we kissed it up real nice.
你吻了她  然后呢012---So you kissed her, What happened after that?
我就跑来告诉你们012---I came over here to tell you guys.
而她在对面等你012---So she's just waiting over there for ya?
对012---Yeah.
老友记  第六季  第11集  见色不忘友012---Friends  S06E11  The One With The Apothecary Table
我得走了  好012---I gotta go. Okay
我上舞蹈课要迟到了012---I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
好012---0Kay.
我真的已经迟到了  好012---Okay, now I'm really leaving. Okay, I'm all right.
但你可以012---But can you just...
把嘴唇留下来吗012---...just leave your lips?
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
你们吻过她吗012---Have you kissed her yet?
相当销魂的012---It's awesome!
我怎么吻都吻不够012---I could do it forever.
她的吻功比我妈的厨艺还强012---You know what? She kisses better than my mom cooks.
幸好你说的是厨艺  对吧012---I'm so glad you said "cooks." Right?
瑞秋  你得通知邮局你搬家了012---Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? you've got to tell the post office that you've moved.
你的信件还是都寄到这里来012---Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
陶瓷货仓  剩下的可以扔了012---Oh! Oh! Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
我不是你的清洁工012---I'm not your garbage man.
我是你的邮差012---I'm your mailman.
摩妮卡  你看012---Monica, look! Look-look-look!
这里有我订的桌子012---Here is that table that I ordered. Ah!
你是在陶瓷货仓买的  对  这叫药师桌012---You got it from Pottery Barn? Yeah. It's an apothecary table.
有谁知道药师是什么吗012---Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
就是药剂师012---A pharmacist.
就是药剂师012---A pharmacist.
瑞秋  菲比最讨厌陶瓷货仓了012---Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
我也讨厌陶瓷货仓012---I hate Pottery Barn too.
我才在床上坐坐  就被赶了出去012---They kicked me out just because I sat on a bed.
你脱了裤子钻进被子里了012---You took off your pants and got under the sheets.
我很困啊012---I was tired.
菲比讨厌陶瓷货仓012---Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?
对啊  量产的东西她都讨厌012---Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff.
她觉得她的家俱  应该要有历史  要有典故012---She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
这有典故啊012---Well this has a story behind it.
这是大老远从白原店运来的012---I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
她喜欢独一无二012---It’s gotta be one of a kind.
就像她那个丑到爆的水果陶碗012---Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
那是我做的012---Hey! I made that for her.
你会捏陶   对012---You made pottery? Yeah.
是从垃圾堆捡来的啦012---I made it out of a fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
你把桌子搬回家  肯定会被念到死012---I'm telling -- If you put that in her apartment, you'll never hear the end of it.
好  我就说那是古董012---Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her that it's an antique apothecary table.
她也不必知道它的出处012---She doesn't have to know where it came from.
你看  我爱死这些小抽屉了012---Ah, I love these drawers.
上面说可以放三百张CD012---Oh, look! It says that it holds 300 CDs.
正如往昔的药师桌012---Ah, just like the apothecary tables of yore.
然后农夫说012---So the farmer says:
"那不是母牛  你也不是在挤奶"012---"That's not a cow, and you're not milking."
你们能在一起真好012---I am so glad you guys got together,
钱德跟我一直在找一对情侣朋友  现在总算找到了012---Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one.
我们是成双又成对012---We're a couple of couples.
今晚真开心   那家餐厅好棒012---I had so much fun tonight. What a great restaurant!
钱德  我居然让你请客012---And Chandler, I can't believe I let you pay for this one.
再次感谢012---Thanks again, man.
明天要不要过来  我来做我说的那种意大利面012---So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
那太好了012---That'd be great! Okay.
不过至少让我们带酒来012---Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
不必客气了  不行  我坚持012---Joey, you don't have too! Ah, I insist.
你会买吧   会啦012---You'll get the wine, right? Yeah.
那就晚安  明天见012---Okay, good night. See you tomorrow.
好期待喔012---Can't wait.
我们要怎么逃过一劫012---How are we going to get out of that one?
什么  我没办法连续应酬他们012---What? I can't handle two nights in a row...
两晚012---...with them.
摩妮卡和钱德有什么不好012---What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
不晓得  他们就是有点012---I don’t know, they're just a little...
哈啦012---...blah!
哈啦012---Blah?
他很哈啦  她012---Well, you know, he's blah. She's just...
她很娇小  嗓门却很大012---She's very loud for such a small person.
他们是我最要好的朋友012---Uh, they're my best friends.
我们不能跟他们往来吗  那可就麻烦了012---Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that'd be a problem.
不是  往来当然可以012---No! Of course we can still hang out with them.
只是不要连续两晚012---Just y'know, not two nights in a row.
好吗  好吧012---Okay? I guess.
谢谢012---Thank you.
要我卖了朋友  给你买礼物都行012---If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
好棒的桌子  在哪里买的012---Ooh! What a great table! Where did you get it?
你猜012---Guess.
跳蚤市场012---Um, a flea market?
我就知道你会一猜即中012---Ha, See, I knew, I knew you would get it on the first guess.
很酷吧   这是药师桌012---Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table.
哇哦012---Wow!
你可以想像  他们就是把药材012---Oh you can just imagine that this is where...
存放在这里面012---...they kept all their stuff to make potions.
你知道  对啊012---You know? Ooh, yes.
几乎能闻到鸦片的味道012---Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
就是啊012---Almost.
多少钱012---Oh, how much was it?
才5百012---Just only 500 bucks.
跳蚤市场买的要5百012---500 bucks at a flea market?
我以为你是问012---Oh, okay see I thought,I thought you meant how much was it...
当年  全新时候的价钱012---...when it was new, y'know like back then
不是  就是说嘛012---Oh, no. Yeah, no.
因为是跳蚤市场   所以差不多1块钱012---I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
1块钱  再加50元012---A dollar? And fifty?
总共51元012---So it was like one and fifty dollars.
他们用古法算钱  对012---Ohh, okay, they gave you the old-time pricing. Yeah.
这是哪个年代的012---Well, what period is it from?
往昔年代012---Uh, it's from yore.
就是 "往昔的时代"  知道吗012---Like, the "days of yore," you know?
对  我知道012---Yes, I do.
天哪  真是太完美了012---It's just perfect. Oh, good.
这一定有很棒的典故012---Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too.
卖方有提到它的出处或者012---Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or...
有  这个我知道  它来自白原012---Yes, that I know. This is from, uh, White Plains.
白原012---White Plains. Mm-hm.
听起来好神奇的一个地方012---Ooh, it sounds like such a magical place.
我来了012---Hey! I'm here. Hi!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
你喜欢吗   完了012---You like it? Oh, my God!
这是我的新药师桌012---It's my new apothecary table!
罗斯  菲比就快到了  不能让她看到012---Ross! Phoebe'll be here any second. She can't see this.
为什么  她一定会喜欢  这是好东西012---Well why not?! She'll love it. It's the real thing.
是在陶瓷货仓买的012---I got it at Pottery Barn.
我知道  我也买了一张012---I know you did! I bought the same one.
她看到你的桌子  就会知道我骗她012---And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. 
我说我们的是原版  为什么012---I told her ours was an original. Why did you do that?
因为她讨厌陶瓷货仓012---Because she hates Pottery Barn.
她讨厌陶瓷货仓012---She hates Pottery Barn?
我也很惊讶  她说那是量产012---I know! I know, She says it's all mass-produced...
没有真品  大家买的都一样012---...nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.
她随时都会进来  拿个东西先盖住  好吗012---So come on! she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
什么  不  不要012---What? No, no.
我才不要遮遮掩掩的012---I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.
不过我也买了很漂亮的床单012---Although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets.
我忘了他们也出床单012---Ooh, I forgot they made sheets!
废话012---Heh, yeah.
她居然会讨厌陶瓷货仓012---I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn.
罗斯  别再念了  她又不是讨厌你012---Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
但是  她讨厌陶瓷货仓嘛012---Yeah, but Pottery Barn?
我觉得  她根本就是怪胎012---You know what I think? It's just she-she's weird.
因为她是双胞胎  双胞胎都很怪012---Y’know it’s because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
罗斯  她不是怪胎  她只是希望她的东西独一无二012---Ross, she's not weird. She just wants her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.
什么才是最不独一无二的  双胞胎012---Huh. You know what's not one-of-a-kind? A twin!
菲比来了  把灯关掉  看电影吧012---Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out the lights and watch the movie.
好漂亮的床单  喜欢是吧012---Okay. Hey, ooh, cool sheet! You like it?
想知道哪里买的吗  好啊012---You want to know where I got it? Sure.
在跳蚤市场买的012---At a flea market.
你去跳蚤市场买床单012---You buy your sheets at a flea market?
罗斯  别这么小气吧012---Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
晚餐再过20分钟就好了  好兴奋喔012---The dinner will be ready in 20 minutes. This is so exciting.
这是你今晚要带过来的酒012---And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.
你想送花给摩妮卡012---You were also gonna buy Monica flowers...
却买不起  因为你付了昨晚晚餐的钱012---...but you couldn't afford it,because you paid for dinner last night.
谢谢  但今晚只有我要过去012---Thanks. But, uh, it's just gonna be me tonight.
吉宁怎么了  她病得很重012---What happened to Janine? She's, uh, really sick.
真糟糕  对啊  她整天都在房里012---That's too bad. Yeah, she's been in there all day.
发高烧  鼻塞012---Uh, high fever, nose problem. It's...
痰痰痰痰痰012---Phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.
摩妮卡   钱德012---Monica! Chandler!
今晚真抱歉  乔伊说了吗012---I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you...
有出戏我一定得去看  抱歉012---...I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry.
玩得开心点  好012---Have a great time, huh?
怪了  没有痰啊012---That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
不  她真的病得很重012---Oh, no, she really is sick.
那她为什么要去看戏012---Then why is she going to a play?
你知道的  感冒想退烧012---Uh, well, you know, "Starve a fever...
就要去看戏012---...go to a play for a cold."
乔伊   吉宁为什么不来吃饭012---Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?
她不想连续两晚都陪你们012---Uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row.
对不起012---I'm so sorry.
她为什么不想陪我们012---Why doesn't she want to hang out with us?
因为她觉得  你很哈啦012---Because she, uh, she-she thinks that you are "blah."
而摩妮卡  你的嗓门太大012---And that, uh, you, Monica, are too loud.
什么012---What?!
什么012---What?
所以她昨晚只是假装开心012---So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? 
她当面骗我们012---She was lying to our faces?
太扯了012---I can't believe this.
她凭什么批评我们012---Who is she to judge us?
我们对她多好  我才不是哈啦  我是谈笑风生012---We couldn't have been nicer to her. And I am not "blah." I am a hoot!
我知道  我知道012---I know, I know.
拜托啦  别生气012---Come on, please, you guys. Don't be mad.
她一定是012---I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff ...
紧张才会这么说  你们是我最好的朋友012---because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends!
我们又是第一次约会012---Y’know? And it was our first date.
而且  她病得很重012---Plus, she's really sick.
你明明说那是假的012---No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!
但你不觉得"生病"比"看戏"好吗012---I know, but don't you think the "sick" thing is way better than the "play" thing?
都很好  我通常都说  摩妮卡又醉了012---Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again."
拜托啦  再给她一次机会012---Come on you guys, please just give her another chance.
她一定会喜欢你们的  我保证  当然好012---She'll come around, I promise. Of course we will.
回去煮饭吧  好012---Come on, we gotta make dinner. Okay.
我不喜欢那个女人012---I do not like that woman!
我听得见012---I can hear you!
我的嗓门真的很大012---I am loud!
真好笑012---Isn't it good?
菲比  别把脚翘在我的新012---Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new...
旧床单上012---...old sheet.
好012---Oh, sure.
我的药师桌012---My apothecary table!
什么  不012---What? No!
这张桌子是哪里买的  陶瓷货仓  好吗012---Ross, where did you get this? I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
天哪  菲比012---Oh, my God! Phoebe,
陶瓷货仓抄袭我们古董的设计012---Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
天哪  要是他们会抄袭012---Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table...
那张桌子一定不止值51元012---...ours must be worth much more than one and fifty dollars.
这张连鸦片的味道都没有012---Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
当然没有  只有你洒出来的酒味012---Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! 
谢谢你还毁了我的床单012---And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
别激动  罗斯  我赔你80分就是了012---Ross, calm down. I'll give you the 80 cents.
再来一次012---Okay, one more time.
钱德  你还要柳橙汁吗012---Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
音量刚刚好  就是啊012---Perfect decibel. I know!
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们在干什么012---Uh, what are you guys doing?
没什么  就是聊天哈啦012---Nothing. We're just talking. You know, blah-blah-blah.
别这样  你们说过要尽力的012---Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try!
我来找你们和吉宁一起去看电影012---I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
你们觉得呢  非常乐意012---What do you say? I'd like to...
但是  我不确定有时间012---...but I'm not sure if we have the time.
真好笑  我也很无奈012---Ha, very funny. I don't know what to do.
我真的很希望你们处得来012---I really want you guys to get along.
拜托  你们跟我们去吧  这是你们欠我的012---Just please, come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
我们欠你  没错012---We owe you? That's right.
你们刚交往时  我帮了很多忙012---I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship.
我还帮你们偷鸡摸狗6个月012---I helped you guys sneak around for like six months.
跟白痴一样012---I looked like an idiot.
还被羞辱012---And I was humiliated.
却只赚了2百012---And I only made $200.
我们没有给你钱012---We didn't give you any money.
你以为我不知道吗012---You don't think I know that?
我不知道该拿它配藤条餐桌椅012---see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair..
黄色书桌012---...the Sahara desk...
还是螺形托脚桌012---...or the Parker console table.
原来你们这里也有陶瓷货仓012---Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
我知道  我有点买疯了  有点012---I know, I know. I went a little crazy. A little?
这里就像目录第72页012---Your place looks like page 72 of the catalog.
看012---Look at that!
装饰  鸟笼  大号的012---The ornamental birdcage! Large. Ha, ha.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
罗斯  小心  那个很老了012---Oh, Ross? Be careful. That is very old.
殖民地时代早期的  鸟商  都用那个带 鸟上市场012---Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
有意思012---Fascinating.
又一个惊人的发现012---Another amazing find! Wow.
它一定也有很棒的典故  没错012---Oh I bet this has a great story too. It does.
这是殖民地时期  分隔房间的装置012---It is a room-separating apparatus from Colonial times.
有好多东西都来自殖民地时期012---Huh, a lot of this stuff is from the Colonial times.
还有哪些时期呢   瑞秋012---What are some other time periods, Rachel?
有往昔012---Well, there's yore.
还有昨年012---Ahem, and, uh, you know, yesteryear.
瑞秋对这种东西真的很有眼光012---Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a good eye for this stuff.
罗斯  如果你家要重新布置012---Ross, y'know if you ever decide to redecorate--
我觉得很有必要重新布置012---and I think you should--
你应该找瑞秋帮忙012---you should ask Rachel to help.
他才不需要我的帮忙012---Oh honey, he doesn't need my help.
拜托  他早该扔掉那些  你是怎么说的012---Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of the. What'd you call it?
廉价的赝品和恐龙垃圾012---The, uh, "cheap knockoffs and dinosaurjunk"?
是吗012---Really?
你知道吗  既然你这么清楚我的需求012---You know, since you have such a great sense of what I need--
我这里有60元012---Uh, here's 60 bucks.
你带着菲比去殖民时期跳蚤市场012---Why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial, uh, flea market...
帮我办货吧012---...and get me some stuff?
我觉得菲比不会想去012---Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe wants to come.
不  我想去  她想去012---No! I do want to! She does want to.
她想去  没错012---She does want to. Yeah!
菲比  我不知道该说什么  上次跳蚤市场还比较逛得012---Pheebs, I don't know what to say.I guess the flea market was just better last time.
至少我帮罗斯买了床单  没错012---Well, at least I got these sheets for Ross. Yeah.
看  是陶瓷货仓012---Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.
你不懂  别看了012---Ugh, yeah, you know what? Don't look at it.
真的  别看了  你看012---Seriously, don't look at it. No! Look-look!
他们抄袭我们的咖啡桌012--- There's the coffee table they stole from us.
那些混蛋  我们走012---Oh, those bastards! Let's go.
那台电风扇跟我们的有点像  还有那个乌笼和012---That fan kind of looks like ours, and the birdcage, and...
等一下  这简直就像是我们的客厅012---Wait a second, this is our exact living room!
不  才不像呢012--- No! No it’s not! 
菲比  我们的完全不一样012---No it’s not! Come on, Phoebe, ours is totally different.
我们没有   我们没有那盏灯012---I mean, we don't have the - We don't have the…that lamp! .
还有那扇屏风  是在另一边012---And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
天哪  那些都是陶瓷货仓的东西012---Oh, my God. This is where you got all our stuff.
陶瓷货仓  我的天哪  不是012---Pottery Barn! Oh, my God! No. no.
好啦  你说对了  对不起012---Okay-okay look—no I did,, all right? I'm sorry.
我想要这些东西  又知道你讨厌陶瓷货仓012---I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn.Just...
你不要生气  但是我气死了  气死了012---Come on don't be mad. No-no-no, but I am mad!I am mad!
这代表世间所有丑恶的东西012---Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world...
都在我的客厅里012---And it’s all sitting up in my living room...
而我却只想着我没有那盏灯012---...and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
那就买下那盏灯012---Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.
我们有罗斯给的60元012---We have that 60 bucks from Ross.
