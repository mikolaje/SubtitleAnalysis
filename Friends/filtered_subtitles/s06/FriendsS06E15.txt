你们猜怎样012---Hey, you guys, guess what?
巴瑞和敏蒂要离婚了012---Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.
天哪   你是怎么搞的012---What is the matter with you?
不  是巴瑞和敏蒂012---No. Barry and Mindy.
对不起  我一听到离婚就觉得是罗斯012---Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce," I immediately go to Ross. Heh.
谁是巴瑞和敏蒂012---Who's Barry and Mindy?
巴瑞是我差点要嫁的人   敏蒂是我最要好的朋友012---Barry was the guy I almost married, and Mindy was my best friend.
他们不是有一腿嘛012---Wasn't he cheating on you with her?
对   但那只表示他做到一半   会在她身上睡着012---Yeah, but that just means he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
要是我真的嫁给他   我的人生会多么不同012---Could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
我懂你的意思   我也总是在想012---I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be...
要是我没有离婚会怎么样012---...if I'd never gotten divorced.
哪一次   第一次啦012---Which time? The first time!
真的  要是卡萝没发现  她是同性恋012---No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
我无法想像  我老是朝好的方面去想012---I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
那我一定还在练控手道012---I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay.
后来在我婚姻末期   我经常练控手道012---Towards the end of our marriage, I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension...
好发泄一下因缺乏肉体运动而多余的精力012---...from, you know, not doing anything else physical.
也许你不把空手道  念成控手道就没事了012---Maybe the problem was pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."
如果我还是很胖呢012---And what if I was still fat?
你一定不会跟我交往  当然会012---Well, You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
少来了012---Sure I would.
什么啊  你们真的觉得我那么肤浅012---What? You guys really think that I'm that shallow?
不  我只是觉得摩妮卡太胖012---No, I think Monica was that fat.
要是我没被 《我们的日子》开除呢012---Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired off Days of Our Lives.
卡萝又出现了012---Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.
要是我有勇气辞职呢012---What if I had had the guts to quit my job?
我可能在帮《纽约客》写稿   拿搞笑来赚钱012---I'd probably be writing for The New Yorker, being paid to be funny.
现在的工作也很有趣   而且明天012---But my job's fun too. I mean, tomorrow...
上班也不必打领带012---...I don't have to wear a tie.
要是我去美林证券上班呢012---What if I'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
什么   美林证券012---What? Merrill Lynch?
对   我有个客人在那上班   他说我天生具有炒股的头脑012---Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
那你怎么不去012---Well why didn't you take the job?
因为当时我很相信押韵这回事012---Because at that time, you see, I thought that everything that rhymed was true.
我觉得要是我去做股票  就得住地窖012---So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks,...
只能吃安眠药  养三脚猫012---...I'd have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
你们觉得如果有这些事   我们还会在一起吗012---Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?

摩妮卡  你还在跟无聊医生交往012---So, Monica, still going outwith Dr. Boring, huh?
他才不无聊   他只是012---He's not boring. He's just...
只是比较低调012---He's just low-key.
你的榛果拿铁  谢谢012---Here you go, one hazelnut latte. Thank you.
其实榛果不是果实012---You know, the hazelnut, actually not a nut.
而是种籽012---It's a seed.
哇哦012---Wow.
还有谁能说出一种  假装是果实的常见种籽012---Can anyone else name a well-known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
天哪  我想想看012---Oh, dear God. Let me think.
嘿012---Hey.
你怎么了012---Oh, no. What's the matter?
我又被退稿了012---I got another rejection letter.
他们说我的东西很有趣   只是不符合《阿奇漫画》风012---They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."

你要我给你一些钱吗012---You, uh, need me to give you some money?
我穷归穷   还是有骨气012---Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
是吗012---Really?
是012---Eh.
也许乔伊不必给你钱012---Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you money.
电视明星都有助理  对吧  可行012---TV stars have assistants, right? That's an idea.
要是我请助理转交   你会收吗012---If I hire an assistant, would you take money from her?
不是啦  乔伊  钱德可以当你的助理012---No, Joey. Chandler could be your assistant.

开什么玩笑   我最爱阿奇那帮人了012---Are you kidding me? I love Archie and the whole gang.
阿奇需要钱修他的老爷车012---Well, um, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy.
但他不想跟瑞吉拿钱012---Uh, but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money.
所以瑞吉就找他当助理012---So Reggie hires him as his assist--
当管家012---As his butler.
然后就叫他做一堆无聊的事012---And makes him do crazy things...
像什么  叫他买不能有结块的奶昔012---...like bring him milk shakes that can't have lumps.
等等  听着有点耳熟啊012---Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar.
这个故事画过了吧   我觉得我看过012---Did they already do that? I think I read it!
