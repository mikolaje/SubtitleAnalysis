好棒的希望  嗯012---Ooh. That's a good one. Yeah?
我是想开大型客机012---Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

希望自己坠机身亡的人012---...whose resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
也许你应该立志不取笑朋友012---Maybe your resolution should be not to make fun of your friends.
尤其是会免费搭你去012---Especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free...
欧洲的人012---...on their own plane.
她开飞机的机率012---She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose...

这样  干脆一星期好了012---You know what? Better yet, a week.
我赌了  朋友012---I'll take that bet, my friend.
要不  输我那50元012---And you know what? Paying me the 50 bucks can be...
就可以当你的"每日新鲜事"012---...the "new thing you do" that day.
就从现在开始012---And it starts right now.
我的新年新希望是学吉他012---All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play guitar.
真的  为什么012---Really? How come? Ah.

你要我教你吗  我是个很好的老师012---Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.

收在收屉里  你们懂我的意思吧012---...in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
或许你应该让自己别那么八卦012---Hey, Rach, maybe your resolution should be to, urn, gossip less.
我哪有那么八卦012---What? I don't gossip.
或许我偶尔会发现一些事012---Maybe sometimes I find out things.
或听到一些事  然后转述出去012---Or I hear something and I pass that information on.
当做一种服务012---You know, kind of like a public service.
这并不代表我很八卦  你们会说新闻主播八卦吗012---Doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Koppel a gossip?
如果他说同事隆胸失败的话012---Well, if Ted Koppel talked about his coworkers' botched boob jobs...
我是说012---...yeah, I would.
她隆成这样啊012---Well, they were like this.

嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我约刚才那个女生出去012---I just asked that girl out.
漂亮  漂亮012---Nice. Nice. Yeah.

宏史歪哥012---Hornswoggle.
你还好吗  钱德  这个姓012---You okay, Chandler? ls there something--?
这个姓有哪里好笑吗012---Something funny about that name?
没有  我只是觉得在哪里好像听过012---No, no, I just think that maybe I've heard it somewhere before.
是吗  真的  在哪里听过012---Oh, really? Where?
一定是个很好笑的地方012---Somewhere funny I'll bet.
嘿  菲比  猜猜  什么012---Hey, Pheebs. Guess what? Hey.
我要跟一个叫伊丽莎白 宏史歪哥的约会012---Uh, I have a date with, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

好吧  好012---Oh. Okay. Okay.
好  第一课  和弦012---Okay. Lesson One: Chords. Ah.
我不知道这些和弦的真正名称012---Now, um, I don't know the actual names of the chords, um...
不过我照手势帮它们取了名字012---But I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.
所以  这是"熊爪"012---So then, this is "Bear Claw."
"火鸡脚"012---Okay, "Turkey Leg"...
和"老太太"012---...and "om Lady."
真是有趣的吉他教学方式012---What an interesting approach to guitar instruction.
有些人可能会觉得好笑  我觉得很普通012---You know, some might find it amusing. I myself find it regular.
各位012---Hey, everybody.
瑞秋今天很乖  她都没有八卦012---Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
没错  即使我发现012---I didn't. Even when I found out, um--
总之  我发现了某人的某件事012---All right, let's just say I found out something about someone...
但是012---...and let's just say...
我不会说出来012---...she's gonna keep it.
菲比  你看012---Hey, Pheebs. Check this out.
你搞定老太太了012---Ooh. You nailed the Old Lady. Oh!
我觉得我进步了012---Hey, listen, I thought I was getting better...
就在回家的路上  我去了吉他店012---...so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store--
你在店里有碰吉他吗012---Did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?
有吗012---Did you?
没有012---No.
手给我012---Give me your hands.

这一手  弹片012---Pick.
你想学吉他吗012---Do you want to learn to play guitar?

谁来说句话吧012---Someone comment on the pants.
很帅气啊  我很喜欢012---I think they're very nice. I really like them a lot.
我想的不是这个012---Not what I had in mind.
罗斯这种人通常不穿这种裤子012---See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants.
因为  这种裤子很紧012---You see, they're very tight.
也许可以评论一下012---Maybe there's something in that area?
很好看啊  我喜欢012---I think they look really good. I like them.
在哪里买的012---Yeah, where did you get them?
今天  我还没做新鲜事呢012---See, I needed a new thing for today.
我一直觉得这家皮衣店很香012---And there's this leather store I go by that always smells so good.
于是我心想  我从来没买过012---And I thought to myself, "Wow. You know, I've never owned...
一条很香的皮裤012---...a really good-smelling pair of pants before."
拜托啦012---Oh, come on.
说真的  你们觉得怎样012---Okay, seriously. What do you think?
好怪  难看死了012---You look like a freak. Yeah, awful. Awful.
你在干什么  你在干什么012---Hey. What are you doing? What are you doing?
这是我的新年新希望  把我儿子弄瞎012---It's my New Year's resolution. To blind my child?
不  是多照照我们的相片012---No, to take more pictures of all of us together.
我觉得这样最好  大家都会喜欢012---I really think it's the best resolution. Everyone can enjoy them.
当然  大家也都会喜欢我的演奏012---Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
天哪  这条裤子热死了012---My God, these pants. I'm burning up.
她现在靠过来  是想让我死吗012---Oh, God. She wants to snuggle now? What, is she trying to kill me?
这里面跟火山一样012---It's like a volcano in here.
你热吗  不热012---Are you hot? No.
那就是我在热012---Okay, it must just be me then.
那是裤子跟沙发磨擦的声音012---That was just the pants and the couch.
可以借用一下洗手间吗012---Um, hey, do you mind if I use your bathroom?

升G  升G012---G-sharp. G-sharp?
你在偷学和弦名称吗012---Have you been studying the real names of the chords?
有没有012---Have you?
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
那又怎样  我又没碰吉他012---What? I didn't touch a guitar.
但是你质疑我的教学方式012---No, but you're questioning my method.
我不是质疑  菲比  我就觉得很蠢012---No, I'm not questioning it, Phoebe. I'm saying it's stupid.
干嘛012---What?
谢谢012---Thank you.
其他学生012---You know, none of my other student...
都不觉得我蠢012---...thought I was stupid.
你的其他学生就是你012---Your other student was you!
那又怎样  也许你应该更用功012---Yeah, well, you know, maybe you just need to try a little harder.
也许我应该找个正牌老师012---Maybe I need to try a real teacher.

小朋友拿着吉他012---Yeah, and the kid's got a guitar!
好吧   你去跟你的专业老师去学吧012---Fine. You go learn from your qualified instructor.
等大家听腻 "坏蛋李洛布朗" 012---But don't come crying to me when everyone is sick and tired...
你可别哭着来找我012---...of hearing you play "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown."
全城最坏的大坏蛋012---Baddest man in the whole damn town
好啊  你去帮他啊012---Oh, fine. Take his side.
我好想赶快去找你012---I can 'I' wait to be with you.
罗斯把小孩接走我就溜过去012---I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
我会告诉瑞秋  我要洗两个小时衣服012---I'll tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple hours.
洗衣服  那会是我的新绰号吗012---Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
不是012---Aw.
你明知你的绰号是大鹏012---You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big--
喂  乔伊  我是罗斯  我需要帮忙012---Hello? Joey, it's Ross. I need some help.
钱德不在012---Uh, Chandler's not here.
你可以帮我012---Well, you can help me.
好吧  听着012---Okay. Listen.
我在伊丽莎白的浴室里012---I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.
漂亮012---Nice.
不是  我觉得穿皮裤太热  就进来脱掉012---No, I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off.
结果它一定是遇汗缩水了012---But they must have shrunk from the sweat or something.
要不就是我的腿遇热膨胀了012---Or my legs expanded from the heat.
我现在穿不回去了  乔伊  穿不回去了012---I can't get them back on, Joey. I can't.
这情况  严重了012---Oh. That is quite a situation.
你有粉之类的东西吗012---Uh, do you see any, like, powder?
粉之类  有  我有爽身粉012---Powder. Yeah, yeah, I have powder.
很好  很好012---Good, good. Okay.
把它撒在腿上  能吸汗的012---Sprinkle some on your legs. It'll absorb moisture.
裤子就能穿回去了012---Then you can get your pants back on.
好  等一下012---Yeah, hold on.
裤子还是拉不上来012---They're not coming on, man.
你看看  找得到凡士林吗012---Um, you see any--? Oh, Vaseline?
我找到乳液  我有乳液  乳液能行吗012---I see lotion. I have lotion. Will that work?
行  把它涂在腿上  等下012---Yeah, sure, throw some of that on there. Hold on.
你还好吧012---ROSS, you okay?
裤子还是拉不上来012---They're still not coming on, man.
而且乳液和爽身粉糊成了一团012---And the lotion and the powder have made a paste.
是嘛012---Really?
什么颜色012---Uh, what color is it?
什么颜色有差别吗012---What difference does that make?
如果跟裤子的颜色一样  你就糊一条假裤子012---Well, if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself paste pants...
她就看不出来了012---...and she won't know the difference.
乔伊  你有空吗012---Joey, do you have a minute?
我该怎么012---Dude, what am I--?
瑞秋来了  祝你好运  让我知道结果012---Rachel's here, so good luck, man. Let me know how it works out.
乔伊  我遇到天大的问题了012---Oh, Joey, I have such a problem.
你来得正好012---Oh, well, your timing couldn't be better.
我正在到处救火012---I'm putting out fires all over the place.
好  乔伊  我得告诉你一件事012---Okay, okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something.
什么事  什么事012---What is it? What is it?
天哪  这件事太大条了  但你得保证  不能说出去012---Oh, my God. It's so huge. But you have to promise me, you cannot tell anyone.
不  不要  我不想知道  什么012---No, no, no. I don't want to know. What?
不  不  你绝对想知道  太不可思议了012---Yes, yes, yes. You do want to know. This is unbelievable.
我不管  我不想再当  知道所有秘密012---I don't care, Rach. Look, I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets...
却不能说的人012---...and can't tell anyone.
什么秘密  你知道什么秘密012---You know secrets? What are they?
你不该八卦的012---And you're not supposed to be gossiping.
我知道  但这件事我怕藏不住  我刚才拿起电话012---No, I know, I can't keep this in. So I pick upthe phone--
我不听012---I'm not listening to you.
罗斯  嗯012---Ross? Um...
你进去很久了012---You've been in there for a long time.
我开始有点害怕了012---I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.
好了  我要出去了012---All right, I'm coming out.
你可以把灯关掉吗012---Hey, can you turn the lights off?
不行  灯就让它开着吧012---No. Let's just leave the lights on.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
我出了一点状况012---I had a problem.
菲比012---Hey, Pheebs.
我不能跟你说话  我又没在电话簿上登过广告012---Oh, I can't talk to you. I don't have a fancy ad in the yellow pages.
这样012---Look.
菲比  你听我说012---Pheebs, I just...
我为批评你的教学法道歉012---I want to apologize for saying your method was stupid.
我也想重新拜你为师012---And maybe, ask you to be my teacher again?
我保证  在你说可以之前  绝对不碰吉他012---And I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
我真的可以了012---You really think I'm ready? Uh-huh.
哇  酷毙了012---Wow, cool.
好的012---0Key-
那个和弦弹对了吗  不对012---Was the chord at least right before--? No.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
我们听说了  好惨012---We heard about your pants. I'm so sorry.
照理说今年应该很美好才对012---This year was supposed to be great.
才第二天  我就成了012---Well, it's only the second day, and I'm a loser...
穿不合身皮裤的衰人012---...with stupid leather pants that don't even fit.
没这回事 你不衰012---You're not a loser.
你们看我012---Look at me.
你看  罗斯012---Hey, look. Look, Ross.
班画了你的画像012---Ben drew a picture of you.
你是牛仔喔012---Huh? You're a cowboy.
因为我穿皮裤012---Because of the leather pants?
班并不觉得你衰  他觉得你是牛仔012---Ben doesn't think you're a loser. He thinks you're a cowboy.
很棒吧012---I mean, that's something.
真的很棒  牛仔哥012---It really is something. Howdy, partner. Hey.
也许我应该再去买一条012---Maybe I should get another pair.
他们有一些012---Ooh, you know, they had some...
侧边有流苏的012---...with fringe all down the sides.
我去跟班说晚安012---I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.
他居然觉得我是牛仔012---I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
我会是个好牛仔012---I would make a good cowboy.
好  既然没事  我要去洗衣服了012---Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
我也去  如果这一件脏了的话  脏了012---Yeah, me too. You know, if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
我也要走了012---Okay, I'm gonna go to.
我要去机场  只要等久一点012---I'm gonna go to the airport. If I hang around there long enough...
应该能逮到没人管的飞机012---...someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
祝你好运  再见012---Good luck, honey. Bye.
乔伊  记得我要给你说的那件大事吗012---Hey, uh, Joey, remember that big thing I was going to tell you about?
我不会告诉你  但如果你自己发现012---I'm not gonna tell you. But if you found out on your own...
那就没关系了  我们就可以讨论了  对吧012---...that would be okay, and then we could talk about it, right?
那样就不是秘密  的确没关系012---Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So, yeah, that would be okay. Yeah, yeah.
嘿  乔伊  你去钱德的房间012---Hey, Joe, would you mind going over into Chandler's bedroom...
把我借给他的书拿回来好吗012---...and getting that book back that he borrowed from me?
现在  你要我现在去012---Now? You want me to go over there now?
现在012---Yeah.
你知道了什么吗  你知道了什么吗012---Do you know something? Do you know something?
我或许知道了  我也是012---I might know something. I might too something too.
你知道了什么  你先说我才能说012---What's the thing you know? You tell me what you know.
我不能说  那我也不能说012---I can't tell you. Then I can't.
那好吧012---Okay, fine.
你才不知道012---You don't know.
不如我现在就去钱德的房间  就可以知道012---How about I go there and walk into Chandler's bedroom and see the thing...
我想的确实没错012---...that I think I know is actually the thing I think I know.
你知道  你也知道012---You know. And you know.
对  我知道012---Yeah, I know.
钱德和摩妮卡  真叫人不敢相信012---Chandler and Monica? Oh, this is unbelievable.
你知道多久了  太久了  天哪012---How long have you known? Too long. Oh, my God.
瑞秋  我早就想找人说了012---Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long.
