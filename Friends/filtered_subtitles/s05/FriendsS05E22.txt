我想他零钱正好用完了012---Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
他连话都不想跟我说  这样我要怎么跟他道歉012---Y'know, He won't even talk to me. How am I gonna apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
或许你应该寄点东西给他012---Maybe you should send him something.
等他到了赌城  就知道你想表达歉意了012---So when he gets to Las Vegas, he'll know that you're sorry.
好主意  上哪儿找一堆成人A片呢012---That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn?
不行  不能用成人片道歉啦  真的012---Oh, no,  don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn! Really?

你为何生我的气  因为你说我很无趣012---Why are you mad at me? You said I was boring. Oh.
我何时说过你无趣了012---When did I say you were boring?
天啊  我想起来了  我们下西洋棋那次012---Oh, my God, I remember now. We were playing chess.
菲比  我和你没下过西洋棋012---Phoebe, you and I have never played chess.
