摩妮卡  这真是史上最棒的  感恩节大餐012---Monica, that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever.
太好吃了  你把我们都快撑死了012---It was so good. I think you killed us.
我连一口都吃不下了012---I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
我要吃甜的012---I need something sweet.
有人想看电视吗  好啊012---Does anyone wanna watch TV? Yeah. Sure.
摩妮卡  你的遥控器按不动了012---Monica, your remote doesn't work.
菲比  你得把它拿起来对准012---Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
知道012---Oh.
算了012---forget it.
你们知道吗012---Hey, you know what we should all do?
我们应该来玩感恩告白游戏012---We should play that game where everyone says one thing they're thankful for.
我要说  感谢今年的秋天这么美012---Oh, I... I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
说得真好  好甜蜜  乔伊012---Very nice. Sweet, Joe.
那天我在车站等公车012---Yeah, the other day, I was at the bus stop...
突然吹来一阵可爱的秋风012---...and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere...
把一个女生的裙子吹了起来012---...and blew this chick's skirt right up.
对了  我还要感谢丁字裤012---Oh, which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
老友记  第五季  第08集  感恩节大回顾012---Friends  S05E08 The One With The Thanksgiving Flashbacks
与其说它是内裤  不如说是一种伟大工程012---It's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering.
料子那么少  效果却那么大012---It's amazing how much they can do with so little material.
它还会戏弄你  有穿吗  没穿吗012---And the way they play with your mind. I mean, is it there? Is it not there?
你知道你还在碎碎念吗012---Are you aware that you're still talking?
有没有人要感谢  丁字裤以外的东西012---Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
我不知道要比较感谢离婚呢  还是感谢被赶出来012---I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce, or my eviction?
我还以为  你会没有感谢的呢012---Wow, see, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
抱歉  这是最惨的一次感恩节012---I'm sorry. It's just this is the worst Thanksgiving ever.
不  不行  我才是悲惨感恩节盟主012---No, no, no. I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.
你不能挟失败的婚姻空降  抢了我的宝座012---You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage...and take that away from me.
你又要说你爸妈离婚的事了012---You're not gonna tell the whole story  about how your parents got divorced, are you?
别这样嘛  我想听012---Come on. I want to hear it.
没有钱德扫兴  就不算感恩节了012---It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out.
这跟游行一样  是一项传统012---It's a tradition, like the parade.
如果游行也出柜离家  抛妻弃子的话012---If the parade decided it was gay, moved out and abandoned its entire family.
钱德  亲爱的012---Now, Chandler, dear.
爸爸和我要离婚012---Just because your father and I are getting a divorce...
并不代表我们不爱你012---...doesn't mean we don't love you.
只是代表他上床的对像是男仆  而不是我012---It just means he would rather sleep with the houseboy than with me.
小少爷还要火鸡吗012---More turkey, Mr. Chandler?
你说得对  你的更惨  你是悲惨感恩节盟主012---You're right, yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
不一定  我有一次更惨012---I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
惨过 "小少爷还要火鸡" 吗012---Really? Worse than:"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"
小少爷跟仆人有仇吗  对  我的更惨012---Did the little rich boy had a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse.
还要绷带  还要绷带012---More bandages! More bandages!
再给我一些绷带  这个人快死…012---Please, can I get some more bandages in here? This man is... Aah!
不会吧012---Oh, no.
今生的才算  菲比012---In this life, Phoebe.
今生是吧  那钱德的比较惨012---Oh, this life.Oh, okay. No, Chandler's is worse.
记得前世的事一定很酷吧012---Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that.
我都没有前世的记忆了012---I don't have any past life memories.
当然没有  你是新生命012---Of course, you don't, sweetie. You're brand-new.
我知道摩妮卡最惨的感恩节012---I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
那个就别提了  说嘛012---Oh, let's not tell this story. Oh, come on.
我知道  我知道012---Oh, no! I know! I know!
就是摩妮卡的火鸡  卡在乔伊头上那次012---It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head.
什么  什么  乔伊头上卡了只火鸡012---What? What? Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?
其实不是那样  其实就是那样012---Hey, it's not like it sounds. It's exactly like it sounds.
哈罗012---Hello?
哈罗012---Hello?
菲比012---Phoebe?
乔伊  怎么了012---Joey? What's going on?
我的天哪  我知道  它卡住了012---Oh, my God. I know.It's stuck.
小心台阶  它怎么会跑到你头上012---Step. How did it get on?
是我套上去想吓钱德012---I put it on to scare Chandler.
天哪  摩妮卡一定会气死012---Oh, my God. Monica's going to totally freak out.
赶快帮我拿下来012---Well, then help me get it off.
这里面好臭012---Plus, it smells really bad in here.
当然很臭  你的头塞在动物尸体的屁股里012---Of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
你替火鸡涂 … 我的天哪012---Hey, did you get the turkey...? Oh, my God!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
那是谁  乔伊啦012---Who is that? It's Joey.
你在干什么  你是在搞笑吗012---What are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
不是搞笑  是吓人012---No, it's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be scary.
马上给我拿掉012---Get that off now.
拿不掉  卡住了012---I can't. It's stuck.
我不管  我爸妈的20个客人012---Well, I don't care. That turkey has to feed 20 people.
不能就着你的头吃012---They're not going to eat it off your head.
先别急  大家一起想办法012---Hold on, okay? Let's just all think.
我知道了  菲比012---Okay, I got it. Phoebe?
这样  你拉012---All right. You pull.
我尽量把腿撑开012---I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.
乔伊  现在不要闹  对不起012---Joey, now is not the time. Yeah. Sorry. Right, sorry.
好  数到三  一  二  三012---Okay, count to three. One, two...three.
成功了  我吓到你了  看吧012---It worked. I scared you. I knew it. Ha, ha!
大哥  我在这里012---I'm over here, big guy.
我知道012---Yeah, you are. Ha, ha!
我吓到你了012---I scared you. Whoo!
你看起来真的很白痴012---You did look like an idiot.
白痴的不只是我012---Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot, all right?
罗斯有一次想说冬南瓜012---Remember when Ross tried to say "butternut squash"...
结果讲成南冬瓜012---...and it came out, "squatternut bosh"?
的确  一样白痴012---Yeah, that's the same.
那就是我最惨的感恩节012---That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving.
等等  瑞秋说的不可能是那次012---Oh, wait. That can't be the one that Rachel was talking about...
她根本不知道那件事012---...because she didn't even know that that happened.
所以是哪次  哪次012---So, what's yours? What was it?
我真的不想提这件事012---Um, I really don't wanna tell this story.
讲嘛  莫妮卡012---Oh, come on, Monica.
重温悲惨的回忆  是感恩节的精神012---Reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving's all about.
至少我觉得是  还有原住民的帮忙012---You know, for me, anyway. And, of course, the Indians.
最不希望我提的绝对是你012---Look, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story.
什么意思012---What is that supposed to mean?
摩妮卡  应该是瑞秋来了012---Monica, I think Rachel's here.
我来开012---I'll get it.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving.
我不快乐  奇普和我分手了012---Not for me.Chip and I broke up.
为什么  怎么了012---Oh. Why? Well, what happened?
我爸妈不是要出门  奇普不是要来么012---You know how my parents are out of town, and Chip was gonna come over?
对  你要给他你的花芯012---Yeah, yeah. And you were gonna give him, you know...your "flower."
摩妮卡  你能不能直接说做爱012---Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?
你那样讲让我浑身发毛012---It really creeps me out when you call it that.
还有012---Okay, and by the way...
在做的时候  男人的那里不叫他的温柔012---...while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his "tenderness."
相信我012---Believe me.
嗨  瑞秋012---Hi.Hi, Rachel.
感恩节快乐  你也是012---Happy Thanksgiving. You too, sweetheart.
各位  这是钱德012---Uh, everyone...this is Chandler.
我的室友兼我们乐团的主唱012---My roommate and lead singer of our band. Heh.
罗斯012---Ross?
这是摩妮卡  我是罗斯的妹妹012---Oh. This is Monica.Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.
好012---Okay.
欢迎你来   钱德012---I'm so glad you could come, Chandler.
有很多吃的  希望你饿了012---We've got plenty of food, so I hope you're hungry.
妈  钱德痛恨感恩节  他不吃感恩节食物012---Oh, Mom, no, no, Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
那还真是欢迎啊012---Oh. Well, I'm so glad you brought him here, then.
钱德  我可以帮你煮起司通心面012---Hey, Chandler, If you want, I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
只要当年的清教徒没吃  我就吃012---As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it, then I'm in.
讨厌012---Damn it.
瑞秋012---So, uh, Rach...
我去上大学不在012---Does it...? Does it feel weird around here now?
你会不会觉得怪怪的012---You know, since I've been away at college?
那倒不会  那就好012---Oh.No, not really. That's cool.
那你012---So...
奇普居然为了那个花痴南西  而甩了我012---Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut, Nancy Branson.
我再也不跟他约会了012---I am never going out with him again.
他再怎么求我也没用012---I don't care how much he begs.
他有了南西  应该不会求你了012---I think his begging days are over, now that he's with Nancy Branson.
你知道吗  我受够高中男生了012---You know what? I've just had it with high-school boys.
他们全是些又笨又呆的小毛头012---They're just silly.They're just silly, stupid boys.
我要开始跟男人交往012---I'm gonna start dating men.
茱蒂  对不起  我找不到你和杰克要的碗012---Uh, I'm sorry, Judy.I couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for.
叫爸爸妈妈吧012---Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.
摩妮卡012---Monica.
钱德012---Hey, Chandler?
起司通心面好吃吗012---Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
很好吃  你应该去当厨师012---Oh, yeah. It was great. You should be a chef.
好啊012---Okay.
你猜怎样  南西很花痴的传闻都是假的012---Guess what. All this stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor.
所以奇普甩了她  他今天晚上想来找我012---Chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house tonight.
太棒了  就是啊012---Oh, that is so great. I know.
天哪  要是你和奇普晚上做了012---Oh, gosh. Listen, if you and Chip do it tonight...
你一定要把细节都告诉我012---...um, promise me you'll tell me everything?
那当然  其实也没什么  我们应该有做过一次012---Oh, totally, totally. It's not that big a deal. We already kind of did it once, you know.
我知道  但这回你一定能确定  我知道012---I know, but this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it.I know.
奇普还保证  这次会持续一整首歌的长度012---Oh, and Chip promised that this time it would last at least for an entire song.
我晚上打算约瑞秋出去012---So I'm thinking of asking Rachel out tonight.
弹我们上周写的那首歌给她听012---You know, maybe playing her that song we wrote last week.
"忧愁的背包"012---"Emotional Knapsack"?
对  漂亮012---Yes. Right on.
不过不要拖太久012---Oh, uh, but don't take long, okay?
我们还要去试用假身份证012---Because we're testing our fake ID's tonight.
对吧  克里夫艾维瑞兹012---Right, Clifford Alvarez?
听着  罗兰陈012---Listen, Roland Cheng...
如果一切顺利  我们搞不好不会回来012---...if things go well, I may be out with her all night.
兄弟  别丢下我012---Dude, don't do that to me.
没关系  你可以留下来  我爸妈不会介意012---Oh, no. It's cool, you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
不是  我不想整晚  跟你的肥猪妹妹在一起012---It's not that. I don't wanna be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
摩妮卡  把这些派吃完吧012---Monica, why don't you finish off these pies?
冰箱里塞不下了012---I don't have any more room in the fridge.
不  不了  谢谢012---No.No, thank you.
茱蒂  你成功了  她终于吃不下了012---Well, Judy, you did it. She's finally full.
我说你肥  我完全不记得012---I called you fat? I don't even remember that.
我可记得012---Well, I do.
对不起  真的  我那时候很愚蠢012---I'm so sorry. I really am. But, come on, I was an idiot back then.
我还在"轰"的演唱会上  冲上台大叫012---I rushed the stage at a Wham! Concert, for crying out loud.
你居然说她肥012---Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
你居然让乔治麦可赏你耳光012---I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
真的很抱歉  我太差劲了  真是对不起012---I am really sorry.That is so terrible. I'm so, so sorry.
其实我说的不是那次感恩节012---Actually, that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
就是 不是  我说的是…012---Yes, it was. No, it wasn't. It was actually...
好吧  感恩节结束了  准备过圣诞节吧012---Ok. Thanksgiving's over. Get ready for Christmas.
谁要去买圣诞树012---Who wants to get a Christmas tree?
我有最可爱的圣诞节故事012---Oh, no. I have the cutest Christmas story.
我们想听摩妮卡的感恩节故事012---We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story.
我的故事里有小矮人断成两截  不过随便012---Fine, all right. Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half.But, you know, whatever.
瑞秋  你妈说你又转系了012---So, Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again?
没办法  心理系馆旁边很难停车012---Oh, yeah, I had to.There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
瑞秋012---Hi, Rachel. Oh, hi.
你的新鼻子真漂亮  杰克012---Wow. Love your new nose. Jack.
怎样  威尔森医生是个艺术家012---What? Dr. Wolfson's an artist.
他帮我点掉一堆痣  你要看吗012---He removed my mole cluster.Want to see?
我去开  不  让我去012---No, God. Please, let me.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving. Hi.
你的发型变了好多012---God, your hair sure is different.
我们刚才还在讲012---Yeah, we were just talking about that.
我们以前真的好蠢012---Can't we can't believe how stupid we used to look.
摩妮卡呢012---So, uh, where's Monica?
在楼上  摩妮卡  快下来  人都到齐了012---She's upstairs. Monica. Come down, everyone's here.
罗斯  瑞秋  和那个痛恨感恩节的男生012---Ross, Rachel and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
钱德  我的天哪012---Hi, Chandler.Oh, my God.
怎么了  我的衣服有脏东西吗012---What's the matter? Is there something on my dress?
你变了好多  看起来好漂亮012---You just... You look so different. Terrific.
那件裙子  那个身材012---That dress, that body...
喂  抱歉012---Dude. Sorry.
对  摩妮卡瘦了  太好了012---Yes, yes, Monica is thin. It's wonderful.
但我们比较关心罗斯的新女友  妈…012---But what we really want to hear about is Ross' new girlfriend.Oh, Mom...
好吧  她叫卡萝012---Okay. Um, ahem, her name is Carol...
她很漂亮  很聪明012---...and she's really pretty and smart.
她是长曲棍球和高尔夫球校队  很厉害吧012---And, uh, she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team.Can you believe it?
她两个校队都打012---She plays for both teams.
钱德   那就晚餐见了012---So, Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
喂  抱歉012---Dude. Sorry.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
真是酷毙了012---That was so awesome.
你完全报了一箭之仇012---You totally got him back for calling you fat.
他的口水流了满地012---He was just drooling all over you.
感觉一定很过瘾012---That must have felt so great.
一点也不过瘾   什么012---Well, it didn't. What?
没错  我很漂亮012---Yeah, I mean, I look great.
感觉很轻盈  心脏的毛病也没了012---And yeah, I feel great, and, yeah, my heart's not in trouble anymore.
但我还是觉得没报到仇  懂吗012---I just don't feel like I got him back, you know?
我想狠狠的羞辱他012---I mean, I just want to humiliate him.
我想让他光着身体012---I want him to be, like, naked...
再指着他大笑012---...and I want to point at him and I wanna laugh.
好  搞不好可以012---Okay. That, we may be able to do.
怎么做012---How?
男人要做爱之前都会脱光衣服012---Well, guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
什么  我这么努力瘦这么多012---What? I mean, I didn't work this hard and lose all this weight...
可不是为了把花蕊给他那种人012---...just so I could give my flower to someone like him.
好  第一   你再那样讲  保证没有人会要你012---Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one is ever gonna take it.
第二  又不是要你来真的012---And then second of all, you're not gonna actually have sex with him.
只是要你误导他012---You're just gonna make him think that you are.
也对012---Yeah. Yeah.
等他脱光了012---And then when he's naked...
我就把他赶出去  锁上门012---...I can throw him out, lock the door...
让所有的邻居耻笑他012---...and all our neighbors will just humiliate him.
那你就绝对报了仇012---And then you will definitely get him back.
我要怎么误导他012---Okay, so how do I make him think I want to have sex with him?
我知道了012---Uh, Oh! Here's what you do.
假装什么都能让你兴奋012---Just act like everything around you turns you on.
什么意思  就是什么都能挑逗你012---What do you mean? Well, like, anything can be sexy.
像…像这条擦碗巾012---Like, um... Oh, okay. Like this dish towel.
它的触感好舒服012---This feels so good against my cheek.
如果我热了  就可以拿它来吸汗012---And if I get a little hot, I can just dab myself with it.
或是把它放在腿边  边跟他说话边玩弄012---Or I can bring it down to my side and maybe run it through my fingers while I talk to him.
这个我会  很好  很好012---I can do that. Okay, good, good, good.
行了  他来了  他来了012---Get busy. He's coming. He's coming.
嗨  你好  嗨012---Hey, what's up? Hey.
摩妮卡  你能不能帮我煮  去年那种通心面012---Monica. I was wondering if you could make me some mac and cheese like last year?
没问题012---I'd love to.
我好喜欢起司通心面012---Ooh.I love macaroni and cheese.
我好喜欢这个盒子的触感012---I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
好  我好喜欢红萝卜012---Okay. Ooh, and I love carrots.
有时我喜欢把它们这样夹着012---Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers.
然后放在腿边跟你说话012---Like this. And hold them down here while I talk to you.
觉得很热的时候…012---Um, and, you know, if I get really hot...
我喜欢拿起这把刀  把冰凉的刀身靠在012---...um, I like to pick up this knife. And, um, I put the cool steel against
身上012---...my body.
你还好吗012---Are you all right?
我很好012---I'm fine.
什么状况  20岁男性012---What do got? Twenty-year-old male.
右脚拇趾被切到012---He's got a severed toe on his right foot.
别撞到他的脚  好吗012---Could you please not do that feet first?
你明知他是拇趾被切到  你刚才也说了012---You know where his injury is. Severed toe, you just said it!
这里说刀子刺穿鞋子012---It says here the knife went right through your shoe.
那当然  他穿的是草鞋012---Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
断指带来了吗  有012---Did you bring the toe? Oh, yes.
在这里冰着012---I have it right here on ice.
放心  我们会把它缝…012---Don't worry, son. We'll just reattach it and then...
怎么了012---What is it?
你带了一块红萝卜来012---You brought a carrot.
什么  这不是你的脚趾012---What? This isn't your toe.
这是一小块  很冰的红萝卜012---This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
你带红萝卜来012---You brought a carrot?
天哪  我的厨房里有一截断趾012---Oh, my God.There's a toe in my kitchen.
对不起  我马上回去拿012---God, I'm sorry. I'll go back and get it.
来不及了  我们只能直接缝合012---It's too late. All we can do is sew up the wound.
我需要我的脚趾头012---Without my toe? I need my toe. Okay.
等一下  我很快  爸  让我开你的保时捷012---No, no, no. I can go really fast. Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.
我才不会上当012---Oh, I'm not falling for that one.
这就是我断趾的原因  因为我说你肥012---That's why I lost my toe? Because I called you fat?
我不是故意的  那是意外012---I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
我就因为这样被叫了一整年的  跛脚趾头先生012---That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?
对不起嘛  又不是一整根脚趾头012---I'm sorry. It wasn't your whole toe.
我少了趾尖  趾尖最棒012---Yeah, well, I miss the tip.It's the best part.
