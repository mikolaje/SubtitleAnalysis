她的按摩技术烂的不行啊012---She gives the worst massages ever.
感觉就像她在拷问我012---It was like she was torturing me for information.
我很想招  又不知道要招什么012---I wanted to give it up. I just didn't know what it was!
要是真的很痛  你应该告诉她012---If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.

我才不要因为说实话而搞砸012---I won't screw that up by telling the truth.
小心012---Dude, look out!

对不起012---Sorry.
兔子跑走了012---And the bunny got away.

还好而已  因为我刚去过医院012---Um, only okay. Because I just got back from the hospital.
你还好吗012---Are you all right?
我很好  但是我外婆死了012---I'm fine. But, uh, my grandma sort of died.
菲比  真抱歉  没关系012---Pheebs, sorry. It's okay.
她这一生过得很精彩012---She had a really incredible life.
我也不是永远见不到她  她会来找我012---It's not like I won't see her again. y'know she's gonna visit.
也许她现在就在这里012---Well maybe, Maybe she's with us right now.
是啊  第一天进入到新世界  结果就跑来咖啡馆012---Right. her first day on a new spiritual plane and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

天哪  对不起012---Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
没关系  其实这样还蛮酷的012---It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kind of cool. 'Cause it's like ...
一个生命结束  另一个生命诞生012---...you know, one life ends and another begins.
他们的做法很难012---Not the way they're doing it.
怎么回事  她是怎么过世的012---What, What happened? How did she die?
我们在超市012---We were in the market...
她弯腰去拿优格  就再也没起来过012---...and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
菲比  真令人遗憾012---Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
她最后说的话倒很窝心012---It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was:
〝你去拿蛋  我拿优格  我们在出口见〞012---"Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter"
你们知道吗012---You know what?
我们绝对会在人生的出口见012---We will meet at the checkout counter.
乔伊  衣服得归还012---Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff.
所以你得穿内裤012---right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?

还少了点什么012---It's missing something.
我知道了  好012---Oh, I know. Um, okay.
真的  皮包啊012---Really? A purse?
这不是皮包  是手提包012---It's not a purse. It's a shoulder bag.
很像女人的皮包  不012---It looks like a woman's purse. No.
相信我  春季T型台上的男模都在背012---Trust me, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog.
你看  男人背包包012---See, look. Men carrying the bag.
你看  女人背包包012---See, look. Women carrying the bag.
我一个男人背女用皮包  居然很帅012---But it is odd how a woman's purse looks so good on me, a man.
没错  男女通用012---Exactly. Unisex!
你或许需要  我2天前刚做过012---Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.

很多人012---Lots of people!
你到底要不要来012--- Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
不要012---Um, no.
我以为她已经死了  我已经接受这个事实了012---See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it.

我原以为它只中看  结果它也很中用  你们看012---At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out!
各种夹层都有012---It's got compartments for all your stuff.
放皮夹的  放钥匙的  放电话簿的  放化妆品的012---Your wallet, keys, address book... Your makeup.

乔伊  要是沾到芥末就不能还了012---Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
干嘛要还  我爱这个包包012---Why would I return this? I love this bag!
好  那你欠我350  好012---All right, then you owe me $350. Fine.

菲比  节哀顺变012---Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.
你知道吗  我外婆有个一模一样的包包012---You know what? My grandma had the exact same bag!
我给你带了些花012---I brought you flowers.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks!
这样感觉有男人味多了012---Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
对不起  打扰下  请问告别式是在这里吗012---I'm sorry. Excuse me, is this the, uh, memorial?
欢迎012---Welcome.
这是你的3D眼镜012---Here's your 3-D glasses.
好012---All right.
你是怎么认识法兰西丝的012---So how did you know Frances?
其实  我们多年不见012---Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.
我以前跟她和她的女儿很亲012---But, um, I was pretty tight with her and her daughter.
是吗  尊姓大名012---Really?! What's your name?
法兰克布非012---Frank Buffay.
更正  其实我叫…乔012---Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe.

你是法兰克布非  不是  乔希尔012---You're Frank Buf... Shh. No! Joe Hill.
你刚才说012---You just said...

但是012---But...
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
怎么了012---What happened?
那是我爸012---That was my dad.
天哪  你们看012---Oh, my God! What? Check it out!
我的手好像正朝着我来012---It's like it's coming right at me.
追到他了吗  他怎么说012---Did you catch him? What did he say?
他说〝很高兴认识你  葛兰达〞012---He said, um, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."
我当然不能说出真名012---Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
为什么012---Why? Why not?
你们也看到  他走得像飞了一样012---Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!
想什么呢  难道他会留下来  跟他抛弃的女儿聊天012---What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
那你怎么说012---What did you say to him?
我自称法兰西丝的遗嘱执行人  有事找他谈012---Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so
我们待会约在咖啡馆012---I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
请各位就座012---Could everyone take their seats?
我现在没办法想这个012---I just can't think about that now.
我只想跟我外婆道别  好012---I want to say goodbye to my grandma. Okay.
走吧012---Let's go say goodbye.
我要去面试了  怎么样012---I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
帅呆了  那个包包会让你被选上012---I think you look great! Joey.That bag is gonna get you that part.
还能钓到男人012---And a date with a man.
随你怎么取笑我  这个包包很棒012---You know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag.
而且是好看又好用012---And it's as handy as it is becoming.
你们不懂  不代表是错的012---Now, Just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong.
以后你们都得习惯  有乔伊012---All right, So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey
就有包包012---...comes with a bag!
我也该走了  我得去见我爸012---All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
菲比  你去了会说什么  会表明你的身份吗012---Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
先不会表明  我不想吓跑他012---Not at first. I don't want to freak him out.
但是你不气他吗012---But aren't you pissed at him?
这家伙遗弃了你012---This guy abandoned you.
如果是我  他就等着挨揍吧012---I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!
我会走进去说 〝喂  老爸012---I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad!!
我们  现在  就出去解决〞012---You and me, outside. Right now!"
我都吓到自己了012---I kinda scared myself.
那起码有吓到人012---Well, at least you scared someone.
说来也奇怪  我应该很生气啊012---Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry.
我的意思是  我应该很想扭断他那颗头012---I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off.
幸好  我已经释怀了012---Fortunately, I'm past it.
你看起来的确有点紧绷绷  我帮你捏捏012---You do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
放开我012---Oh, get off! Ow!
住手  你为什么这样整我012---Stop it! Why are you doing that to me?
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
身为一个按摩师和一个人类012---As a masseuse and a human...
我恳求你  永远别帮别人按摩012---...I'm begging you, never do that to anyone.
我很会按摩啊012---I give good massages.
我以前都帮瑞秋按摩  是她后来会过敏012---I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic!
钱德也很喜欢  你看012---And Chandler, he loves them! Watch.
他才不喜欢  他痛得快要死了012---He does not like it. He's in pain!
他才没有  他有012---No, he's not. Yes, he is!
什么  对不起  但是012---What? I'm sorry but, ow!
你一直在骗我012---You've been lying to me?
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe you'd do that.
也许他只是不希望你难过012---Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings..
但我们一旦开始欺骗对方012---But the minute we start to lie to each other...
我说的〝我们〞012---And by "we"...
指的是社会012---...I mean society.
你好了就开始012---Anytime you're ready.
你一定是新来的012---Ahem, well, you must be new here.
我们找张桌子  我请你喝一杯012---Maybe we get a table, I buy you a drink.
抱歉  你能不能不背皮包啊012---I'm sorry, Could you try it without the purse?
当然  可以012---Yeah, sure.
你一定是新来的  我们找张012---Ahem, well, you must be new here. Maybe we sit...
我可以问件事吗  可以  什么事012---I'm sorry, Can I ask you something? Sure. What?
第一   这不是皮包012---Well, first, it's not a purse.
好012---Okay...
再来012---Anytime.
别以为这是女用皮包012---If you think it's a woman's bag, it's not.
这是男用提包012---It's a man's bag.
好的  继续吧012---Okay. And go.
我拿目录给你看012---Let me show you the catalog.
你看012---Look. See?
这是最新流行012---Huh? It's the latest thing.
每个人都有  男人  女人  小孩都在背012---Everyone's got one. Men, women, children. Everyone's carrying them!
你在推销这些包包吗012---Do you sell these bags?
不是  这些包包摆着就能卖012---No, these babies sell themselves.
好  谢谢  你表现得很好012---Thank you. That was great.
我什么都还没念012---But I didn't read anything.
这样就够了012---I think we've seen enough.
那好  再见012---All right, I'll see you.
搞定了  搞定了012---We got it. We got it.
瑞秋在吗  不在012---Is Rachel here? No.
听我说  我想为下午和按摩的事道歉012---Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing.
我很喜欢你的按摩012---I really like them.
别再硬撑了012---Please stop.
我们都应该坦诚相对012---we're supposed to be honest with each other
我只希望你能明白告诉我 〝我不喜欢你的按摩〞012---I-I just wish you could tell me―just say, "I don't like your massages."
我不喜欢你的按摩012---I don't like your massages.
看吧  又没什么大不了的012---See? It's no big deal.
但是你哭了012---But now you're crying.
我不是在哭这个  我是在哭工作的事012---I'm not crying about that. I'm crying about something at work.
我男朋友说他不喜欢我的按摩012---My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
你又不必事事都抢第一012---You don't have to be best at everything.
天哪  你一点也不了解我012---Oh, my God! You don't know me at all!
好012---Okay...
你的按摩技术天下第一烂012---You give the worst massages in the world.
我在哭啊012---I'm crying here!
听我说完012---Look, hear me out.
比烂的话  你最棒012---You give the best bad massages.
如果有人在找最棒的烂按摩012---If anybody was looking for the best bad massage...
他们自问 〝谁的技术最棒 〞012---and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?"
那绝对非你莫属012---They'd have to go to you.
你的意思是  如果有最佳012---So you're saying that if there was an award...
烂按摩技术奖  那谁会得奖012---...for the best bad massage... Who would get that?
一定是你012---It would be you!
你  摩妮卡  你会大获全胜012---You, Monica! And you'd get all the votes.
或许这个奖可以叫摩妮卡奖012---So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
一定会的012---Absolutely.
好012---Okay...
我烂透了012---I suck!
谢谢你来见我012---Thank you for meeting with me.
谢谢012---Thank you.
这边坐012---Come sit.
坐啊012---Sit.
坐012---Sit!
好的  在开始之前  你必须012---Um, alrighty. Um, before we get started, I need you...
郑重声明  你其实是法兰克布非012---...to state for the official record that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.
是的  我是012---Yes, I am. Mm-hm.
好  法兰西丝留给我什么了012---Okay. So, what did Frances leave me?
这是你找我来的原因吧012---Huh? That's why you wanted me to come.
是的012---Oh, yes.
的确有  她留给你012---Yes, she did. She left you, um...
这支口红012---...this lipstick.
这真是  这是用过的012---Oh, it's, ew, used.
酷012---Uh, cool.
好  我要请教几个问题  我把相关表格拿出来012---Okey. I have just a few questions to ask, so I'll get out my official forms.
好  第一个问题012---So question one:
你娶了法兰西丝的女儿莉莉  正不正确012---You were married to Frances' daughter, Lilly. is that correct?
对  没错012---Yes, I was.
好  第二个问题  这段婚姻012---Okay, um, question two: Um, did that marriage end...
一  很美满012---...A, happily...
二  普通012---...B, medium...
或是三  你最后012---...or, C, in the total abandonment...
抛妻弃子012---...of her and her two children?
表上真的这么写012---It really says that?
对  你看012---Yeah, see?
那我就得选三了012---I guess then I would have to say C.
抛妻弃子012---Total abandonment.
抛弃的原因012---Reasons for abandonment:
一  极机密政府工作012---Um, A, top secret government work...
二  失忆症012---...B, amnesia...
或是三 你就是个自私不负责的012---...or, C, you're just a selfish, irresponsible...
大坏蛋012---...bad, bad man.
其实  我没那么想要这支口红012---Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much.
请你帮个忙012---Would you do me a favor?
把这个012---Would you give Lilly...
交给莉莉  什么012---...that, please? What?
你见着莉莉  请把那张纸条交给她012---When you see Lilly, would you give her that, that note?
我本来想在告别式上找她谈  但是012---Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but,
我觉得她也会像你这样发飙  就临阵退缩了012---well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out.
我写了那张纸条  请帮我转交012---So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
你想来找莉莉012---But you came to see Lilly?
对  怎么了012---Yeah. Why?
莉莉死了012---Lilly's dead.
什么012---She what?
她死了012---She's dead.
你确定012---Are you sure?
没死被火化  就严重了012---If she isn't, cremating her was a big mistake.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this. I just can't believe...
怎么会  天哪012---How? Oh, my God.
多久的事012---How long ago?
17年前012---Seventeen years ago.
那女孩们呢012---What about the girls?
乌苏拉在当服务生  住在苏活012---Well, Ursula is a waitress and she lives in Soho.

菲比  我012---Phoebe, I, um...
我不知道该说什么012---It's just, I don't know what to say.
你居然是我的女儿  你长得这么漂亮012---I just can't believe that you're my daughter. You're so pretty.
那个跟这个无关012---Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.
如果我说我很抱歉012---Would it make you feel better if I said...
你会不会好过一点012---...that I was very, very sorry I left?
你说什么都没差别了012---Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway,
