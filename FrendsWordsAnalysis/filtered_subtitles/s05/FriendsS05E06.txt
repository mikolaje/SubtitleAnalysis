嘿  嘿  嘿  嘿012---Hey, hey, hey, hey.
不准这样  还在我屋里  就得守规矩012---None of that. Not while you're living under my roof.
什么012---What?
就算我知道内幕  也不代表我喜欢看你们亲热012---Look, just because I know about you two doesn't mean I like looking at it.
你试镜不是还有一小时才结束吗012---Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
很抱歉  我可不是中年黑人妇女012---Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman.
而且还走错试镜场地012---And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.
你们要我假装不知道  就得假装你们没怎样012---Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two,then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
好  抱歉012---Okay, sorry.
我听到了012---I can hear that.
瑞秋还在上班012---Rachel's at work.
我还是听得到012---I can still hear you.
老友记  第五季  第06集  雪男012---Friends  S05E06   The One With The Yeti
嗨  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
那是什么012---Hey. What's that?
我妈寄给我外婆的祖传宝物012---Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother.
你们相信吗012---Can you believe it?
一年前我连家人都没有  现在竟然有祖传家产012---A year ago I didn't even have a family,and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
天啊012---Oh, God!
好软012---Oh, soft.
这是貂皮吗012---Is this mink?
对  我妈为何寄皮草给我012---Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur?
她完全不了解我吗012---Doesn't she know me but at all?
我已经有外套了  而且还没牺牲任何可怜动物012---Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.
只不过是时薪12分钱的九岁菲律宾童工012---Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody...
卖命做的012---...for 12 cents an hour.
别听我的  我胡说的012---That didn't happen, I made that up.
嘿  罗斯012---Hey. Ross?
罗斯  你不能在这里贴广告012---Ross, you can't put up flyers in here.
为什么  别人都可以012---How come? Everybody else does.
就是你不行012---You can't.
什么东西012---What is that?
我要处理掉一些家具012---Oh, uh, I'm getting rid of a couple of things.
这是你所有家当012---This is all of your things.
没错012---Yes, yes, it is.
没关系  艾蜜莉说  我们应该买新家具012---No, but it's good. Emily thinks we should get all new stuff.
光属于我们俩的家具  也都是全新的东西012---Stuff that's just ours. Together, you know, brand new.
基本上这是 "瑞秋碰过的家具" 大拍卖012---So basically this is a "getting rid of anything Rachel ever touched" sale.
摸过  用过  坐过  睡过的都不行012---Touched, used, sat on, slept on...
我全买了012---I'll take it all.
罗斯  你不反对012---Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
只要顺着艾蜜莉  她来纽约就没事了012---Look, if I can just do what Emily wants,and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
但是  这种做法也太极端了吧012---Okay, but don't you think that's a little extreme?
毕竟是我说错名字  你能怪她吗012---After what I did, can you blame her?
你已经算轻松了012---Oh, my God. You got off easy.
我朋友席薇的老公在床上喊错名字  她就把他的小弟弟变绿了012---When my friend Sylvie's husband said someone else's name in bed,she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
他这是做什么012---What is he doing?
艾蜜莉觉得罗斯的家具  会沾上瑞秋的虱子吗012---Emily thinks Ross' furniture has got Rachel cooties?
乔伊  别激动  不012---Calm down, Joey. No.
我偏要  事情搞得乱七八糟012---Everything's getting all messed up, you know?
艾蜜莉不准罗斯见瑞秋012---Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.
可是我们会继续见瑞秋  因此罗斯再也不能见我们012---We're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence, Ross stops seeing us.
我也不开心  一切都变了012---Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
我知道  我们不能再见罗斯  乔伊还会用 "因此"012---Yeah, I know. We're losing Ross, Joey said "hence."
我也不高兴012---I'm not happy about this either,
但是  如果罗斯能开心012---but, you know, if Ross says he's happy...
我们不该说出  自己对艾蜜莉的心情012---...then we just have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves.
大家愿意吗012---Are you cool with that?
不要012---No.
不过我是演员012---But, you know, I'm an actor.
我可以装得无所谓012---I'll act cool.
天啊  我怕死储藏室了012---Ooh. Oh, God, storage rooms give me the creeps.
摩妮卡  拜托  你快点012---Monica, please, hurry up, honey, please.
瑞秋  你要吃小圆松饼  就得让我先找到煎盘012---Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
我想吃小圆松饼  好吧012---I want the little round waffles. All right.
找到了012---Here it is.
就在杀虫药下面012---Right underneath the can of bug bomb.
锅碗瓢盆怎么可以  放在毒药下面012---I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
好吧  我吃土司好了012---Okay, you know what? I'll have toast.
天啊  喷他喷他012---Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
我不知道该如何处置这件皮草012---I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
可以给我012---I'll take it.
好主意  太好了012---That might work. Oh, yeah
真好  怎样  你们觉得如何012---Huh? All right, what do you think?
五分钟后换你上台  明妮莉小姐012---You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.
不  只是有点突然012---No, no, no, it's just a bit sudden.
其实我很高兴  也全力赞成012---No, it's great, okay? I am totally on board.
我也爱你  好  再见012---I love you too. All right, bye.
怎么了  罗斯012---What's the matter, Ross?
没事  其实是件好消息012---Nothing. Oh, actually, great news!
我刚跟艾蜜莉通过电话  看来我要搬家了012---Um, just got off the phone with Emily,and looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.
为什么  她认为  而且我也同意012---Why? Well, her thought is... And I agree.
既然要换新家具  干脆也换间公寓012---Fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?
她表妹有个地方要分租012---Her cousin has this great place to sublet.
一边可以看到河  一边可以看到哥伦比亚012---It's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
那是离市区很远的地方  大概要转搭三种车012---That's way uptown. That's like three trains away...
太棒了012---...which is great.
我喜欢搭火车012---I love to ride that rail.
你真的同意012---So you're really okay with this?
当然  离上班地点是有点远012---Yes, yes. I mean, it's kind of far from work...
但是我通勤时就有很多时间012---...but, uh, you know, I'll get so much done on the commute.
她算是送了我一份大礼  那就是时间012---I've been given the gift of time.
真有意思  上次圣诞节  我还得到很多空间呢012---That's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.
两样加起来就是有个小宇宙了012---We should get them together and make a continuum.
现在还要搬家012---Now he's moving?
艾蜜莉到底施了什么法啊012---Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!
他又不在这里012---He's not even here.
大家听我们说012---You guys. You guys.
我们刚刚去储藏室  看到一个很可怕的人012---We were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man.
目露凶光  全身毛茸茸012---He was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast-man.
就像大脚哈利或是喜马拉雅雪人012---He was like a Bigfoot or a yeti or something.
而且他还拿着斧头  瑞秋只好拿杀虫药喷他012---He came at us with an ax, so Rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.
我拉开拉环拼命喷他012---Yeah, I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.
深色头发  满脸胡须  对012---Uh, like, dark hair, bushy beard? Yeah.
你们喷的是丹尼012---Yeah, you fogged Danny.
拜托  才不是丹尼012---Ugh, please. We did not fog Danny.
丹尼是谁012---Who's Danny?
丹尼刚搬到楼下012---Danny just moved in downstairs.
那家伙去安地斯山四个月  才刚回国  人很好012---He just got back from this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
什么人很好  每次我们喷谁  你就帮他说话012---Oh, he's nice. He's nice. You know, you always stick up for the people we fog.
什么事  嗨012---Yeah? Hi.
你大概不记得  我们就是上次喷你的人012---You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
我们很抱歉  乱喷一通012---We're really sorry we fogged you.
随便012---Okay.
嗨  我们只是要告诉你  我们不是故意的012---Hi, uh, just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.
我们以为你是雪人还是怪物什么的012---We actually thought you were like a yeti or something.
随便012---Okay.
怎样012---Yes?
嗨  抱歉打扰你012---Hi. Ahem, sorry to bother you...
你接受我们道歉的态度  让我们很不爽012---...but I don't think that we can accept your acceptance of our apology.
听起来一点也不真心012---It just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
对012---Yeah
随便012---Okay.
那家伙真恶劣012---Wow. That guy is so rude.
没错  他哪里有病012---Really. What is with that guy?
换做我喷你  你早就原谅我了012---I mean, you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
其实  你有喷到我  一点点012---Well, you did, a little bit.
天啊  我很抱歉012---Oh, my God, honey. I'm so sorry.
我完全不介意012---I totally forgive you.
真的012---Really?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你知道  我那个开火葬场的朋友克里斯吧012---So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
火葬场那个克里斯  当然012---Crematorium Chris? Sure.
他说他愿意免费帮我烧皮草012---Well, he said that he would cremate my fur coat for free...
只要我介绍死人去他那里火化012---...if I, um, you know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
天啊  好漂亮的皮草012---Oh, my God.Oh, my God. Look at these pelts.
别太喜欢了  她要烧掉了012---Don't get too attached. She's having it cremated.
什么012---What...?
亲爱的菲比012---Phoebe? Ha. Honey?
我知道你是个怪胎  大家平时也欣赏你这点012---Honey, I know you're quirky, and I get a big kick out of it. We all do, actually.
但是你毁掉这么棒的皮草  实在是不合天理012---But if you destroy a coat like this,I mean, that is like a crime against nature.
说错了  是有违时尚流行012---Not nature. Fashion.
这叫做流行012---This is fashion?
尸体叫做流行012---Okay, so to you, death is fashion?
实在有意思012---That's really funny.
接下来菲比为各位展示  最新的毛茸茸尸体012---Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass
这些动物死于寒冷的俄罗斯012---...from, you know, the steel traps of wintry Russia.
你们真认为好看012---I mean, you really think this looks good?
因为我觉得不赖012---Because I do.
我也想念你  希望快点见到你012---I know, I miss you too. I can't wait to see you.
我爱你  再见012---I love you. Bye.
这什么  石头吗012---Okay, what is in here, rocks?
不  我收集的化石样本012---No, this is my collection of, uh, fossil samples.
就是石头嘛012---So rocks.
我一定会想念这里012---I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Heh.
小班就在那边学会走路的012---You know, Ben took his first steps right over there.
记不记得我上次撞到这里  后来还昏倒了012---Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kind of knocked me out a little?
我很喜欢这间公寓012---I love this place.
老实说  我真希望别搬家012---To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
你的意思是你也不想走012---Uh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
如果艾蜜莉给我选择的机会  你本来就有机会012---Well, I mean, if, uh, Emily gave me a choice. You do have a choice.
罗斯  你为什么要听她的  你疯了吗012---Ross, why are you listening to her? Are you crazy?
为什么012---What?
艾蜜莉这些要求太过分012---It's not right what Emily wants you to do
她根本就是012---She is totally
不要再捏我了012---Stop pinching me.
你们都说只要罗斯快乐  我就不该大嘴巴012---You guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right?
可是  他刚说他也不开心012---Well, he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
这是怎么回事012---What's going on?
我们都讨厌艾蜜莉012---We all hate Emily.
才怪  不  罗斯  我们不讨厌艾蜜莉012---No. No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.
我们只是认为你为了讨她开心  牺牲太多012---We just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
对012---Yeah.
大家都认为她有点不可理喻012---We just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
对  就是不可理喻012---Yes, yes, unreasonable.
不可理喻012---Unreasonable?
要是以后你们谁结婚  大伙也有这种反应呢012---How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married?
你们根本不知道如何维持婚姻012---You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.
婚姻就是互相妥协  永远都会开心吗  不会012---It's about compromise. Do you always like it? No.
但是你愿意吗   愿意012---Do you do it? Yes.
因为婚姻不是只有欢乐  只有梦幻  只管上咖啡馆012---Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky,drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time
婚姻是真实生活012---It's real life, okay?
婚姻只适合成年人012---It's what grownups do.
他说得有道理012---I think he's right.
你们太常泡咖啡馆了012---You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
我对罗斯很抱歉012---God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
我知道012---I know.
我觉得似乎都怪我012---I kind of feel like it's my fault.
似乎012---Kind of?
要不是你大嘴巴  也不会有这种下场012---If you just kept this to yourself, none of this would have happened.
我最近知道的秘密太多  总有说溜嘴的时候012---Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days,something was bound to slip out.
其实你很勇敢012---Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
我坐不住了  我得去走走012---I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
菲比  你怎么还穿那件外套   你不是关心动物吗012---Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
我最近读了一些书  告诉你们012---Well, ahem, I've been reading up, and for your information...
貂不是好动物012---...minks are not very nice.
好  我承认  我喜欢这件外套012---Okay, I admit it. I love this coat, okay?
这是裹在我身上最棒的东西  菲尔亨利都不够好012---It's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley.
你还记得菲尔吗   他帅呆了012---Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.
嗨012---Hi.
原来你比较喜欢短发012---So you like the short hair better?
什么012---What?
雪人  你是丹尼012---Yeti? Uh, Danny?
我得剪头发  因为杀虫剂的味道太浓012---I had to cut my hair to get rid of the,fogger smell.
抱歉  我绝对不会再乱喷了012---Listen, I'm so sorry. I would have never fogged you...
要不是你的样子实在太像012---...you know, if you hadn't looked so... You know, um...
当然012---Absolutely.
有些人只会以貌取人012---Some people are just into appearances.
什么   没关系  无所谓012---What? That's cool. That's cool.
什么  等等  什么无所谓  你根本不认识我012---What...? Hey, whoa, no, no, no, that is not cool.You don't even know me.
你提着一堆购物袋  还拿着百货公司目录012---Come on. You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalogue.
你以为这样就能看透我012---So from that, you think you've got me all figured out?
不可能012---Well, you don't.
搞不好我的袋子里装满  要给贫困儿童的玩具012---You know, I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.
是吗012---Do you?
如果他们喜欢拿紧身裤当玩具012---Well, you know, if kids like to play with capri pants.
随便012---Okay.
不准你再说这个字   讨厌你老这么说012---And stop saying that. I hate that.
随便012---Okay.
好  我不该光看你外表012---Fine! I judged you.
当时我只能靠第一印象  可是你也一样012---I made a snap judgement. But you did it too!
而且你更糟糕012---and you're worse...
因为你只相信第一印象012---...because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgment.
甚至不肯反省自己对不对  你有什么资格说别人012---You can't even open up your mind for a second to see that you might be wrong.What does that say about you?
对面那家披萨店好吃吗012---That pizza place across the street any good?
什么  我饿了  要不要去吃彼萨012---What? I'm hungry. You wanna get some pizza?
你还想骂人也可以继续吼012---You can keep yelling if there's more.
随便012---Okay.
随便  不准你再说这个字  讨厌你老这么说012---Okay. Stop saying that. I hate that.
罗斯012---Uh, Ross?
你还在生我们的气吗  对012---Are you still mad at us? Yup.
很好  因为我们写了一首 "很抱歉" 的歌012---Oh, good, because we have an "I'm Sorry" song. Ha, ha.
告诉你们  我现在心情不好012---You know what? I'm really not in the mood.
罗斯  我很难过012---Look, Ross.I feel really bad.
你生活发生巨大改变  而我却在乱讲话012---I mean, you're going through all this stuff,and I just acted like a jerk.
对  我们都很对不起012---Yeah, we are so sorry.
你们说出歌词了012---You're stepping on the song.
我们实在太离谱了  其实  我们都站在你这边012---Look, we were way out of line, all right? We totally support you.
无论你做出什么决定  我们都赞成012---Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
歌词都被你们说完了  我还唱什么012---Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song.
搬家已经够难过了012---Look, this is hard enough, okay?
现在  真的很需要你们012---I really need you guys right now.
没错  所以我们才要012---Yes, exactly. And that's why...
你今晚过来  我帮你煮几道你爱吃的菜012---Why don't you come over tonight, and I'll make you your favorite dinner? Come on.
好012---Okay.
谢谢你们012---Thanks, you guys.
菲比  你身上这件是貂皮吗012---Pheebs, are you wearing fur?
别再大惊小怪了  这又不是用导盲犬的皮做的012---Okay, let's get some perspective, people.It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat.
罗斯  我知道  我为什么突然爆发了012---You know, Ross, I, uh, think I kind of understand why I lost it today.
是吗012---You do, huh?
你知道我是个演员012---Yeah, you see, um...I'm an actor, right?
所以我的情绪比较丰富  你了解吗012---So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface, you know?
我要同时面临多种情绪  你懂吗012---I got a lot of balls in the air, you know what I mean?
我这种人的生活实在不容易  必须到处流浪   孤孤单单012---It's tough. Guys like me, you know, you wander around, you're alone.
你胡说什么啊012---What are you talking about?
我也不晓得012---I'm not sure.
嗨  回来了  你刚上哪去了012---Hi. Hey, look at you. Where have you been?
我去吃彼萨   跟丹尼去012---Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
怎么可能012---How did that happen?
那个雪人口才真好012---That yeti is one smooth talker.
希望你还吃得下  因为晚餐快好了012---I hope you're not too full, because dinner's almost ready.
我回房间去就好了012---Yeah, you know, I think I'm probably just gonna hang out in my room.
不  为什么012---Oh, no. Why?
拜托你们012---Come on, you guys.
要是艾蜜莉知道  我跟你们一起吃饭012---Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner with you,
她一定会抓狂  你们也很清楚012---she would flip out, and you know it.
没关系  我无所谓012---It's okay. I really... I don't mind.
等等  请你留下来012---Wait, wait, wait. You know what? Just stay.
拜托012---Please.
我希望你留下来012---It would really mean a lot for me if you stay.
罗斯  拜托你  跟我们一起吃饭012---Ross, I just...Rachel, please, just have dinner with us.
好好好  乔伊  别激动  对不起  抱歉012---Okay, Joey, it's okay. Settle down.All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
瑞秋  因为我是演员012---You see, Rach, I'm an actor.
看  那个光屁股的丑八怪  又出现了012---Hey. Hey, look. Ugly naked guy's back.
我好久没看到他了012---We haven't seen him in so long.
天啊  我真想念这个死胖子012---Oh, God. I really missed that fat bastard.
这可真诡异012---Wow. This is so weird.
我刚想到这可能是  大家最后一次一起鬼混012---I just realized this may be the last time we're all hanging out together.
他似乎也知道012---It's almost as if he knew.
我来接012---I'll get it.
喂012---Hello?
嗨  艾蜜莉012---Hi, Emily.
他在这里  你等等012---Yeah, uh, you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
嘿012---Hey.
对  我们正在吃饭012---Yeah, yeah, we're, uh, just having dinner.
好  你等等  她跟大家打招呼012---Uh, yeah, sure, hold on.She wants to say hi.
你等等012---Hold on.
嗨  艾蜜莉012---Hi, Emily.
嗨  大家好012---Hello, everyone.
你们有谁在啊012---So who am I saying hello to?
我不知道这里有谁  不过瑞秋肯定不在012---Well, uh, I don't know about who's here,but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here, and that's Rachel.
最好是这样012---Well, I should hope not.
