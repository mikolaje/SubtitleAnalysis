嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey
摩妮卡012---Monica?
现在几点了012---What time is it?
9点012---Uh, 9.
可是外面还很黑012---But it's dark out.
那是因为你老是睡到中午  傻瓜012---Um, well, that's because you always sleep till noon, silly.
9点就是这么黑012---This is what 9 looks like.
那我该梳洗一下012---I guess I'll get washed up then.
准备看日出012---Watch that sunrise.
我不想再偷偷摸摸了012---I'm really getting tired of sneaking around all the time.
我知道  我也是  不然我们  去外面度周末  就没人打扰我们012---I know, me too. Hey, Y'know what if we went away for the whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions
还可以赤身裸体整个周末012---And we could be naked the entire time.
整个周末  暴露个够012---All weekend? That's a whole lot of naked.
我就说去开会  你就说去参加厨师研讨012---Yeah, I could say I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
我一直想参加泽西州的烹饪大会012---Oh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey!
不过  你去的不是那里012---Ha, ha, okay. You know you're not, though.
对  好  走吧012---Right. Okay. Let's go.
等等  乔伊怎么办012---Wait. What about Joey?
老友记  第五季  第05集  谁进谁出012---Friends  S05E05  The One With All the Kips
你们知道我这周末要干嘛吗012---Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend.
去纽泽西参加烹饪大会012---Going to this culinary fair in Jersey.
真巧  钱德刚才说  要去那里开会012---How weird! Chandler just told us he's got a conference there.
真有意思012---Oh, that's funny
钱德应该  去康州或佛蒙特州开会012---Seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
我又不能决定在哪里开会012---I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
难道你希望大家认为我造假  我可没说谎012---Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
瑞秋在吗  我要找她012---Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
她出去逛街了012---No, she's out shopping.
可恶  怎么了012---Damn. What's going on?
我叫艾蜜莉来012---I told Emily to come.
所以我得赶快跟瑞秋说012---And I just need to, you know, talk to Rachel about it.
等等012---Wait a minute.
艾蜜莉来了之后  你真的就不见瑞秋了012---So when Emily comes, you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
我现在只能专心想着 "我可以见我老婆"012---Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right?
不去想我快胄溃疡的事012---And not the part that makes me do this.
所以你们  再也不能共处一室012---Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?
这怎么可能012---How is that even gonna work?
我也不知道012---I have no idea.
但我一定会想到办法012---But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
看起来实在不可能012---It doesn't seem like it's gonna work.
大家好  嗨012---Hi, guys. Hi.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
怎么了012---What's going on?
我们正要帮摩妮卡翻床垫012---We're flipping Monica's mattress.
我认为  应该先抬起来  再翻过来012---So I'm thinking, basically, we pick it up, and then we flip it.
这方法比我的主意好012---That's better than my way.
要不  你们顺便帮我翻好吗012---Oh, hey, guys, would you flip mine too?
受不了012---Oh, man.
我妈寄信来012---Oh, look! A letter from my mom.
瑞秋012---So, Rach?
你知道艾蜜莉要来012---You know how Emily's coming, right?
我知道啊012---Oh, yeah. I know.
听得到吗012---Can you hear anything?
当然  刚刚有人说  "听得到吗"012---Oh, yeah, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
乔伊的大屁股012---Hey, Joey's ass.
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
记得上次他们吵架分手时  我们卡在房里没东西可吃吗012---Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her all night with no food or anything?
罗斯在婚礼上说出瑞秋名字后  我猜旧戏可能会重演012---Well, when Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again.
所以我在这里藏了这些东西012---You know? So I hid this in here.
有糖果  猜谜012---Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
还有疯狂字谜   我要012---Ooh, Mad Libs. Mine!
保险套012---Condoms?
谁知道会在这里待多久012---Hey, you don't know how long we're gonna be in here.
搞不好我们还得负责  繁衍人类后代012---We may have to re-populate the Earth.
戴保险套还想繁衍后代012---And condoms are the way to do that?
有个关键问题012---Anyway, it all boils down to this.
上次我跟艾蜜莉通电话  天啊  我的狗死了012---The last time I talked to Emily... Aah! Oh, my God! Our dog died!
什么  天啊  拉普死了012---What? Oh, my God. LaPooh, our dog!
拉普还活着012---LaPooh's still alive?
我妈说他被冰淇淋车撞倒012---Oh! It says he was hit by an ice-cream truck
还被拖了19条街012---and dragged for 19 blocks!
我的天啊012---Oh! Oh, my God.
我们听到你在哭  别哭了012---Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
是拉普012---It's LaPooh!
我知道你觉得满肚子大便  过几天就没事了012---I know, it's LaPooh right now but it'll get better.
不可思议  我们到了012---I can't believe it! We're here!
枕头上还放巧克力  我最爱这套012---Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! Oh, I love that!
那你应该跟乔伊住  到处都有巧克力糖012---You should live with Joey. Roll-os everywhere.
我马上回来012---Oh. Okay, be right back.
万岁012---Oh, yes!
摩妮卡快来看  电视正在播警匪公路追逐战012---Monica, get in here. It's a high-speed car chase on!
我们要换房间012---We're switching rooms.
天啊  他们给了我们玻璃杯012---Oh, dear God, they gave us glasses!
杯子上有口红印012---They gave us glasses with lipstick on them.
如果连杯子都没换  谁知道还有哪些东西没换012---If they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.
亲爱的  我只是希望  过个完美的周末012---Oh, come on, sweetie. I just want this weekend to be perfect, okay?
换个房间  好嘛012---We can change rooms, can't we? Okay.
好吧  要换就快换  5号直升机刚跟丢了012---Okay, but let's do it now, though, because Chopper 5 just lost its feed!
嘿012---Hey, so, uh...
记得我上次有事想要告诉你吗012---You know how there was something I wanted to talk to you about?
对012---Oh, yeah.
嗯012---Well...
你知道我很希望跟艾蜜莉合好012---...you know I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
不过012---Well, there's this...
有件事012---...one thing.
好  我要说了012---Okay, here goes.
我答应她了012---I made a promise that
什么  你流鼻血012---Oh hey! What? Your nose is bleeding.
天啊  你流血了012---Oh, God! You're bleeding.
别又来了  我祖父去世时也一样012---No! Oh not again! This happened when my grandfather died.
实在是抱歉012---It's... Ugh, sorry.
好恶心012---Oh, gross, unh.
好了  对不起  你刚才要说什么012---Okay. So I'm sorry. What did you wanna tell me?
抱歉  抱歉012---Sorry. Sorry.
好012---Okay.
我不能再见你了012---I can't see you anymore.
我知道  真是的  我也看不见你012---Yeah, I know, it's ridiculous. I can't see you, either.
我想你们可能会喜欢这间房012---I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
太好了012---Okay, great.
听说他只剩下一半的汽油了012---They say he's only got half a tank left.
一半  那还可以跑很久012---Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
我们必须换房间  什么  为什么012---We're switching rooms again. What? Why?
这间房是花园景观  我们订的是海景房012---This is a garden-view room and we paid for an ocean-view room.
只剩一间海景房  可是你们不喜欢012---Our last ocean-view room was unacceptable to you.
不好意思   我可以跟你谈一下吗012---Excuse me. Um, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
钱德  来了012---Chandler. Yeah?
这些小人想占我们便宜  我才没那么蠢012---Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride. I won't let them.
我们可不是一对小孩012---We're not a couple of suckers.
说得好  大姐头012---I hear you, Mugsy.
这些房间都还好啊  请赶快选定  让我看012---But, look, all these rooms are fine.Okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch the...
让我跟你一起好好度假012---Have a perfect, magical weekend together with you?
我喜欢这间  没了012---Okay, this one I like. Nothing.
没了  结束了012---Nothing. It's over.
竟然没有延长时间012---Damn it, this is regularly scheduled programming!
可以关掉电视吗012---Can we turn the TV off, okay?
难道整个周末都要看电视012---Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
抱歉  我是不是  妨碍你换房间了012---I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room-switching fun?
你发火可别怪到我身上012---Ha, ha, don't blame me for ruining tonight.
否则该怪谁  那个拖着行李  跑过10间房的倒霉服务生012---Who should I blame? The nice bellman who had to drag our luggage to 10 rooms?
我不知道  或许该怪那个012---I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive...
以为用半箱汽油  就可以从纽约跑到加拿大的家伙012---...from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas?
不要说死者的坏话012---Do not speak ill of the dead.
我们出来就是为了过个浪漫的周末012---We're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together.
你到底哪里有毛病012---it-it, What's the matter with you?
我只是想看点电视  有何不对012---I just wanna watch a little television. What's the big deal?
放轻松嘛  老妈012---Jeez, relax, Mom.
你说什么012---What did you say?
我说 "放轻松  小摩"012---I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."
嗨012---Hey.
瑞秋  我一直有话要告诉你012---Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now
我非说不可012---and I really, I just have to get it out.
好  什么事012---Okay. All right. What's up?
好012---Okay.
你上次不是说我应该  不惜代价挽救婚姻吗012---You know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
对  我叫你  答应艾蜜莉所有要求012---Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
你的建议不错  不过我必须告诉你她要求012---And while that was good advice, you should know that what she wants...
什么012---Yeah?
就是叫我永远不能再见你012---...is for me not to see you anymore.
太离谱了  你根本做不到012---Well, that's crazy. You can't do that.
你怎么跟她解释012---What are you gonna tell her?
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你已经答应了  对不对012---Oh, you've already agreed to this, haven't you?
我知道自己很糟糕012---It's awful, I know. Uh, it's.
我心情也很糟糕  但这是挽救婚姻的唯一方法012---I mean, I feel terrible, but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
我很希望跟她合好  必须挽救这段婚姻012---And I do. I have to make this marriage work. I have to.
好在她来之前  我们还能继续见面012---But the good thing is, we can still see each other until she gets here.
我真幸运012---Oh, lucky me!
天啊  这真是好消息012---Oh, my God! That is good news, Ross!
自从拉普过世之后  最大的好消息012---I think that's the best news I've heard since LaPooh died!
你不知道我有多难过  我也很痛苦012---You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. Uh, this is so hard.
是吗  真的吗  罗斯012---Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?
我可以为你减轻压力012---Well, let me make this a little easier for you.
你做什么  愤而出走012---What are you doing? Storming out.
瑞秋  这是你家012---Rachel, this is your apartment.
你看我有多生气012---Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!
臭巧克力糖012---Damn Rolos!
你回来了  嘿012---Hey, you're back. Hey.
这次出差如何012---How was your conference?
糟透了  我跟同事吵架  到回来前都没合好012---It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues for the entire time.
怎么还有012---Are you kidding with this?
那么  你整个周末都泡汤了012---Uh, so your weekend was a total bust?
也不会  我看到  唐纳川普等电梯012---Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
嗨  你也回来了012---Hi. Hey, you're back too.
对  钱德  可以出来一下吗012---Yeah. Um, Chandler, could I talk to you outside for a second?
烹饪大会好玩吗  糟透了012---How was your chef thing? Ugh. It was awful.
有些人根本不会欣赏美食012---I guess some people don't appreciate really good food.
你的美食可能看起来很美味012---Maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first...
吃下去却害人上吐下泻012---...but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
钱德  摩妮卡012---Chandler. Monica.
旅馆费用多少  我要付我那一半012---Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
很好  三百元012---Okay, fine. $300.
三百元  就想成每间二十五元012---Three hundred dollars? Yeah. Just think of it as $25 per room.
你们鬼叫什么012---What are you guys woofing about?
钱德从我皮包偷了二十元纸钞012---Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!
不会吧012---No!
你看  我现在回头想想012---You know what? Now that I think about it...
难怪我老是没有二十元的   原来你倒有很多012---...I constantly find myself without 20s, and you always have lots.
你们应该看看她当时的表情012---You should've seen the look on her face.
我不希望瑞秋恨我  真不知道该怎么办012---I don't want Rachel to hate me. I don't know what to do.
你要听我的建议吗   请说012---You want my advice? Yes. Please.
你听了一定不高兴  没关系012---You're not gonna like it. That's okay.
你决定结婚太匆促了012---You got married too fast.
这算哪门子忠告  看吧012---That's not advice. I told you.
我去洗手间012---I'm going to the bathroom.
要是有人叫我别见你们其中一个  我绝对办不到012---Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I don't think I could do it.
我也不行012---Me neither.
或许我可以012---Maybe I could do it.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
我知道你们听说  罗斯跟我的事情了012---I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross.
我已经烦了一整天  请你们别再提起了012---But I've been obsessing about it all day and would love not to talk about it.All right?
我不知道这算不算提起012---Uh, I don't know if this falls under that category...
不过罗斯就在后面012---...but, uh, Ross is right back there.
那才不是罗斯  不是那个012---That's not Ross. Oh, no, not that guy.
虽然他很像012---He does look like him, though.
罗斯去洗手间了012---Okay. Ross is in the bathroom.
天啊  开始了  现在就这样012---Oh, my God. It's happening. It's already started.
我就像阿吉012---I'm Kip.
什么  你才不是阿吉012---What? Yeah, you're not Kip.
你知道阿吉是谁吗012---Do you even know who Kip is?
谁管他  你是瑞秋012---Who cares? You're Rachel.
阿吉是谁012---Who's Kip?
我以前的室友  以前也跟大家很好012---Kip, my old roommate. We all hung out together.
那个可怜人012---Oh, that poor bastard.
看吧  你们跟我说过那件事012---See? You told me the story.
他以前跟摩妮卡约会  分手后却无法共处一室012---He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together
你们都答应继续跟他做朋友  结果呢012---You all promised you'd stay his friend.And what happened?
还不是从此遭到排挤012---He got phased out.
我们才不会排挤你012---You're not gonna be phased out.
一定会  罗斯一定可以留下来  因为他是你哥哥012---Well, of course I am.It won't happen to Ross. He's your brother,
他又是你大学室友012---your old college roommate.
迟早有人会离开这个小圈子  我以前还以为走的是菲比012---It was a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
拜托  你住得远  又不是谁的亲戚012---Honey, come on, you live far away, you're not related.
很快就会被淡忘012---You lift right out.
嘿012---Hey.
宾先生012---Hey, Mr. Bing.
你住的饭店打电话来012---That, uh, hotel you stayed at called.
说在你房间捡到睫毛夹012---Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
是我的012---Yes, that was mine.
我以为你钓上哪个马子  她忘了带走012---I figured you hooked up with some girl and she left it there.
这种说法的确比较合理012---Yes, that would have made more sense.
我都快要不认识你了012---You know, I don't even feel like I know you anymore, man.
我只问你一次就好012---All right, uh, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time, all right?
无论你怎么说  我都相信你012---And whatever you say, I'll believe you.
你是不是去参加同性恋大会012---Were you or were you no on a gay cruise?
菲比012---Phoebe.
我不该说大家都会淡忘你012---I'm sorry about the whole lifting-out thing.
你得跟着我012---You gotta come with me.
去哪里  跟着我就对了012---Come where? Wherever I go.
你和我  我们可以重组一个团体  毕竟我跟你才是精华012---Come on, you and me, we'll start a new group. We're the best ones.
好吧  不过记得拉乔伊入伙012---Okay, but try to get Joey too.
菲比  我可以跟瑞秋私下谈谈吗012---Pheebs, do you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
当然可以012---Oh, sure, yeah.
再见  罗斯012---Bye, Ross.
永远不见了012---Forever.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你来干什么012---What are you doing here?
这不是违反规定吗012---Isn't this against the rules?
我跟摩妮卡谈过012---I talked to Monica.
是我做这个选择012---Look, I'm the one who made the choice.
我害的大家必须要改变012---I'm the one who's making things change.
所以离开的应该是我012---So I should be the one to, you know, step back.
罗斯  真的没关系012---Oh, Ross... No, no, it's okay. Really.
很多人只有在感恩节见到妹妹  同学会才见到大学室友012---Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving,and just see their college roommates at reunions
在 "汉堡王" 才见到乔伊012---...and just see Joey at Burger King.
这样你舒服一点了吗012---So is, is that better?
一点也没有012---No, it's not better.
我还是见不到你012---I still don't get to see you.
瑞秋  换做你会怎么办012---Well, what would you do, Rach? If you were me, what would you do?
嗯012---Well...
首先  我在婚礼上  不会说错名字012---...for starters, I would have said the right name at my wedding.
竟然会是这样012---I can't believe this is happening.
我知道012---I know.
我很抱歉012---I am so sorry.
我也知道012---I know that too.
瑞秋  抱歉打扰012---Ahem. Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt
菲比说你要告诉我  谈谈旅行什么的012---but, uh, Phoebe said you wanted to talk to me about a trip or something.
嘿012---Hey. Hi.
嗨012---Hi
我来012---I just came over to drop off...
没事012---...nothing.
上周末过得很糟吧012---So that weekend kind of sucked, huh?
对  没错012---Yeah, it did.
那大概我们完了012---So I guess this is over?
什么  我说你跟我啊012---What? Well, you know, you and me.
反正迟早得结束012---I mean, it had to end sometime.
为什么012---Why exactly?
因为上周末  我们吵架啊012---Because of the weekend. We had a fight.
钱德  别傻了012---Chandler, that's crazy.
如果你每次吵架就分手  交往大概不会超过...012---If you give up every time you have a fight with someone,you'd never be with anyone longer than...
所以012---So
我们还可以继续012---this isn't over?
你真可爱012---You are so cute!
当然  我们只是吵架012---No, no. It was a fight.
吵过之后就算了012---You deal with it and you move on.
根本没什么好害怕的012---It's nothing to freak out about.
真的吗  太好了012---Really? Okay, great.
欢迎加入成熟恋人行列012---Welcome to an adult relationship.
我们还算是恋爱男女朋友012---We're in a relationship?
恐怕是  好吧012---I'm afraid so. Okay.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
摩妮卡  听说你上周  看到唐纳川普012---Oh, hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
对  我看到他在等电梯012---Yeah, saw him waiting for an elevator.
瑞秋  借我睫毛夹  我的丢了012---Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler? I think I lost mine.
好啊  在厕所012---Yeah, it's in the bathroom.
乔伊  过来一下012---Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
没错012---Yes.
没错012---Yes.
你  跟你012---You? And you?
对  但是你不能告诉别人  还没有人知道012---Yes, but you cannot tell anyone. No one knows.
怎么会  何时的事012---But how? When?
要从伦敦说起  伦敦012---It happened in London. In London!
我们之所以没告诉大家  是不想你们大惊小怪012---The reason we didn't tell anyone was we didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.
这的确是大事012---But it is a big deal!
