罗斯与艾蜜莉已经宣誓012---Ross and Emily have made their declarations...
我很荣幸宣布  他们结为夫妻012---...and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
你可以亲吻新娘了012---You may kiss the bride.
这比他娶同性恋那次更糟糕012---This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
保持微笑012---Just keep smiling.
好012---Okay...
进行得真顺利012---Well, that went well. Yeah.
他没开枪杀死她就不错了012---It could've been worse. He could've shot her.
刚刚真有点耍宝012---Ha, ha. That was pretty funny, wasn't it?
老友记  第五季  第01集  阴错阳差012---Friends  S05E01  The One After Ross Says Rachel
你搞砸所有事情  简直是恶梦一场012---You spoiled everything. It's like a nightmare.
我的亲朋好友都在场  我以后拿什么脸见人012---All my friends and family are out there. How can I face them?
你怎么做得出来012---How could you do this to me?
罗斯和艾蜜莉  不管怎样012---Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily...
我们都吃得到蛋糕吧012---...we still get cake, right?
没关系  亲爱的  你慢慢来012---That's all right. No, no. You take your time, sweetie.
我在外面等你012---I'll be out here. Ha, ha.
她要补妆012---She's just fixing her makeup.
我恨你012---I hate you.
我也爱你012---And I love you.
罗斯  你偏挑这个时候  说错名字012---Boy, a bad time to say the wrong name, huh, Ross?
你说得对  谢了  老爸012---That's true. Thanks, Dad.
大家应该跳舞啊012---People should be dancing, huh?
这是婚宴  来吧012---Hey, this is a party. Come on.
乔伊  跳舞啊012---Joey. Dance.
喂   华森室内设计012---Yes, Waltham Interiors.
你好  我是罗斯盖勒的私人医生  费兰吉012---Hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Phalange.
谁012---Who?
我发现罗斯忘了吃药012---Yeah, I discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine.
他这人不吃药012---Um, now, without it, uh, in the brain of Ross...
就有可能讲错女人的名字012---...uh, women's names are interchangeable.
这完全不能怪他012---Through no fault of his own.
天啊  是菲比你啊012---Oh, my God. Phoebe.
我不是菲比  是费兰吉医生012---No, not Phoebe. Dr. Phalange.
你也错乱了012---Oh, no. You have it too.
喂012---Hello?
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
希望你别误会012---Wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way...
我知道我们今晚约了要见面012---...but I know we had plans to meet up tonight and...
但是我担心以后做不成朋友012---Ugh. I'm just kind of worried about what it might do to our friendship.
我明白012---I know.
我们怎么这么不小心  还不小心了七次012---Ugh. How could we have let this happen? Seven times.
你知道  我们人在国外012---You know, look. We were away.
又是浪漫的异乡  对012---In a foreign, romantic country. Right.
都怪伦敦不好012---I blame London.
坏伦敦012---Bad London.
听着012---So look, um...
既然我们还在伦敦  就可以继续  对不对012---...while we're still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it, right?
看来我们别无选择012---Well, I don't see that we have a choice.
但是一回家就不能做了012---But when we're back home, we don't do it.
只能在这里012---Only here.
我看到楼下有酒窖012---You know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs.
我两分钟后下去找你  好012---I'll meet you there in two minutes. Okay.
摩妮卡  我有事情要问你  现在啊012---Mon? Mon, I got to ask you something. Now?
罗斯刚刚说出我的名字012---Ross said my name up there. I mean, come on.
我不能假装没听到吧012---I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
我不知道012---I don't know.
摩妮卡  我该怎么办  做正确的事012---Monica, what should I do? Just do the right thing.
什么012---What?
听天由命  努力争取  不要死心眼012---Tow the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box.
等等  听着  我要问罗斯  他是什么意思012---Monica, wait, listen. I'm gonna talk to Ross about what he thinks it meant.
等等  瑞秋  不行012---Wait. Rachel, no.
他结婚了012---He's married.
结婚了012---Married.
要是你还不懂  我也没办法012---If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
你说得对012---Okay. You're right.
你说得对  你帮不了我012---You're right. You can't help me.
杰克  这是我们的错吗  没把小孩教好012---Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
差不多吧012---Yes.
没地方坐还叫人吃牛排012---Oh yeah? Well, who serves steak when there's no place to sit?
你要我们怎么吃嘛012---I mean, how are you supposed to eat this?
你们好  怎么样012---Hey, what's up?
你去哪里了  不是约好了在酒窖碰面012---Where were you? We were supposed to meet.
算了  当我没说  为什么012---Forget it. That's off. Why?
两分钟后012---The next tour of the wine cellar...
为各位介绍酒窖012---...will commence in two minutes.
乔伊  你搞什么012---Joey, what are you doing?
你答应菲比  等她生完孩子才吃肉的012---You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
既然我们在国外就不算012---Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
那倒是  他说得对012---That's true. The man's got a point.
嗨012---Oh, hi.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
抱歉  事情竟然出状况012---I'm sorry things aren't working out so well.
的确不太妙  不过会解决的012---Oh, no. Ha, ha. It could be better. It's gonna be okay, right?
当然  我的意思  她不会放在心上的012---Oh, yeah. Of course. I mean, she's gonna get over this, you know?
你只不过脱口说出了我的名字012---I mean, so you said my name.
不过是因为你刚好看到我012---You know, you just said it because you saw me there.
如果你是看到怪胎  也会说012---If you'd seen a circus freak, you would've said:
我娶你  怪胎012---I take thee Circus Freak.
根本没有别的意思  只是无心之过012---It didn't mean anything. It's just a mistake.
没有别的意思012---It didn't mean anything.
对吧  不   不012---Right? No, no.
当然没有别的意思012---Of course it didn't mean anything.
但是我明白艾蜜莉为何误会012---I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something...
因为这刚好是你的名字012---...you know, because it was you.
其实没有意义  真的没有  没有012---But it absolutely didn't. It didn't! It didn't!
罗斯  乐队正在等你跟艾蜜莉来开舞012---Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily,
乐队准备好了012---Oh. Oh, the band's ready.
我们最好听乐队的话012---Well, we got to do what the band says.
我才不在乎呢012---I don't care about the stupid band!
你口水喷到我了012---You spit on me, man.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
艾蜜莉也进去太久了吧012---Emily is taking kind of a long time, huh? Heh.
我结婚时也躲在厕所不出来012---Y'know When I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding...
不过那是因为我要撬开窗户012---...it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
是啊  我心想着要逃出去012---Right. Get the hell out of there. You know?
艾蜜莉012---Emily.
我要进去了012---I'm coming in.
你看  同一招012---Oh, look at that. Same thing.
如果我中途012---In the middle of everything...
大喊 "好啊"   你就当作没听到012---...if I scream the word "yippee," just ignore me.
天啊  瑞秋  嗨  你好啊  瑞秋012---Huh! Oh, my God. Rachel. Oh, hello, Rachel.
罗斯叫出我的名字012---Ross said my name.
好吗  是我呀012---Okay? My name.
他会说成我的名字012---Ross said my name up there.
表示他还爱我012---That obviously means that he still loves me.
不信就算了  我绝对没误会012---Okay, don't believe me. I know I'm right.
你们要不要下楼喝一杯012---do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
好啊012---Yes, we do.
不过我们要先换衣服012---But we have to change first.
对  我想换衣服012---Yes, I want to change.
你先下去占位子  我们五分钟就下去012---why don't you go down and get us a table? Yeah, We'll be down in five minutes.
十五分钟吧012---Fifteen minutes. Ha, ha.
哈罗012---Hello.
菲比啊  是菲比012---Oh, Pheebs. It's Phoebe.
嘿   太好了012---Oh, hey, hey. Oh, great.
嗨012---Hi.
怎么样012---So, what happened?
罗斯说成我的名字012---Well, Ross said my name.
我知道  不过他是无心的012---Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
菲比  我们冷静客观想想看012---Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively.
他从高三就暗恋我012---All right, ninth grade, right?
从那时就疯狂迷上我012---The obsession starts.
好吗  那年暑假012---All right? Summer after ninth grade...
他头一次看我穿两件式泳装012---...he sees me in a two-piece for the first time.
更是不可自拔地爱上了我  不是吗012---His obsession begins to grow, right?
嗨  听着  去我房间换衣服好了012---Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
可是我的衣服在012---My clothes are... Oh.
你看起来真是   没时间废话了012---Wow, you look... No time for that.
好吧012---Okay.
老兄  让我进去  我有女伴012---Hey, dude. Let me in. I got a girl out here.
我这里也有012---Well, I've got a girl in here.
才没有  我看到你跟摩妮卡进去012---No, you don't. I just saw you go in there with Monica.
我们在里面聊天012---Well, we're hanging out in here.
你说我们  谁比较有机会上床呢012---Which one of us is gonna be having sex in there? Me or you?
看来我只能说是你了012---Well, I suppose I would have to say you.
我们正在一起看电影呢  没错012---What if we're watching a movie in here? Which we are.
我们付费了  正在看 "我的巨人"012---And we've already paid for it. It's My Giant.
"我的巨人"   我超爱那部片012---My Giant? I love that movie.
你确定这样好吗012---You really think this is okay?
反正罗斯跟艾蜜莉也用不到012---Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
这里好漂亮012---Oh, it's so beautiful.
可是我总觉得不太妥当012---You know, I don't feel right about this.
摩妮卡012---Oh, Monica...
这是蜜月套房012---This is the honeymoon suite.
本来就该有人在这里嘿咻012---The room expects sex.
如果没有  这间房一定很失望012---The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
在其他蜜月套房面前抬不起头012---All the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
好吧012---Okay.
艾蜜莉  没有  这里也没看到012---Emily? Nope. Not under here.
你还没找到她  没有  我到处都找不到012---You didn't find her? No, I've looked everywhere.
你一定漏掉什么地方  否则早就找到了012---Well, you couldn't have, or else you would've found her.
你应该继续找  大概再找个30分钟012---I think you should keep looking. Yeah. For about, uh, 30 minutes?
或是45分钟012---Or 45?
45分钟可以找到两次了012---Wow, in 45 minutes, you could find her twice.
不了  她一定也找不到我012---No. For all I know, she's trying to find me...
因为我跑来跑去012---...but couldn't because I kept moving around.
从现在开始  我不跑了012---No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.
我就待在这里012---Right here.
时间晚了  我们要走了012---It's getting late. Yeah, We're going to go.
这个012---Actually...
在这里待一会儿如何012---...do you guys mind staying here for a while?
可是我们明天一早  就要搭机回纽约012---Ugh. You know, we got to get up early and catch that plane to New York.
而且那班飞机又很大012---Yeah, it's a very large plane.
那就算了012---That's cool.
不过我们还是陪你一会012---But we'll stay here with you.
谢了012---Thanks, guys. Ha, ha.
我很感激你们的好意  但是你也不用摸我屁股啊012---I really appreciate this, you know, but you don't need to rub my butt.
我们一小时后就要回纽约了012---We have to leave for New York in an hour.
我知道  我一直在看那扇门012---I know. I've been looking at those doors.
隔音效果看起来很好  你觉得呢012---They look pretty soundproof, don't you think?
不行  你疯了012---We can't do that. That's insane.
第一  他可能醒来  第二012---I mean, A, he could wake up. And B, you know...
管他的012---...let's go for it.
艾蜜莉  艾蜜莉012---Emily? Emily.
艾蜜莉  不是她012---Emily! Nope.
不用找她了  她没跟来  我们来拿她的东西012---Forget about Emily. She's not with us. We've come for her things.
她在哪里012---Where is she?
她躲起来了  因为她很丢脸  这辈子都不想再见到你012---She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
很遗憾你们两个闹成这样  兔崽子012---We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey.
不过我觉得你帅极了012---But I think you're absolutely delicious.
抱歉  我人还站在这里012---Excuse me, I'm standing right here.
是啊012---Oh, yes.
阴魂不散012---There you are.
大家动作快  外面还有一堆012---Hey. Hey, you guys. Hurry up. Get some. There's a whole cart outside.
再见了  盖勒  等下  等下012---Goodbye, Geller. Now, hold on. Hold on.
你女儿跟我012---Look, look. Your daughter and I...
今晚预定去度蜜月012---...are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon.
请你们转告她  我会去机场012---Now, you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport...
我希望她也会去012---...and I hope that she'll be there too.
我是说成瑞秋的名字  但这只是无心之过012---Yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything.
她不过是我的朋友  就这样  请转告艾蜜莉我爱她012---She's just a friend. That's all. Now, look, just tell Emily I love her...
我只想跟她共度余生012---...and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
请保证  你们一定会转告她012---Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
好吧  我会告诉她012---All right, I'll tell her.
走吧  臭婆娘012---Come on, bugger face.
打电话给我012---Call me.
你也一天到晚的待在厕所012---You spend half your life in the bathroom.
怎么就不会从窗户滚蛋呢012---Why do you never go out the bloody window?
或许我们不再上床才对012---Well, maybe it's best we never got to do it again.
否则那晚就不会感觉特别了012---Yeah, it kind of makes that one night special.
理论上来讲  我们还在海外012---You know, technically, we still are over international waters.
我去洗手间  待会来找我012---I'm going to the bathroom. Maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
太棒了012---Okay.
我可以问个问题吗012---Hey, can I ask you something?
不行012---Uh, no.
我昨晚跟费丽西蒂  一起看《我的巨人》  我心想012---Felicity and I, we were watching My Giant. And I was thinking...
自己永远不可能  演得跟那个巨人一样棒012---...I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.
你认为我想当演员  是不是只是痴心妄想012---Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
不是012---No.
那个巨人大概比我小五岁012---I mean, the giant's like five years younger than me.
我有办法跟他一样优秀吗012---You know, you think I'll ever get there?
会的012---Yes.
谢了  没问题012---Thanks, man. Okay, man.
但是他比我高好多啊012---But what about how much taller he is than me?
我现在已经不可能再长高了012---I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now.
以后科学怎么发展  我不知道012---And who knows what science will come up with in the future...
如果我死时  只是一个身高平庸的小人物呢012---...but, Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular-size man?
摩妮卡  你厕所上了半个小时012---Hey, Monica. Wow, you've been in the bathroom for, like, a half-hour.
我知道012---I know.
你也吃了牛肉012---Had the beef tips, huh?
嗨012---Hey.
你吃过肉了012---You ate meat!
你跟人嘿咻012---You had sex!
我们才没有   我知道你没有012---No, we didn't. I know you didn't.
我说的是摩妮卡012---I was talking about Monica.
菲比  我才没跟人嘿咻012---Phoebe, I did not have sex.
怀孕害的我灵感不准012---Oh, this pregnancy is throwing me all off.
我要去跟小鸡小鸭打招呼  我跟你去012---I'm gonna say hi to the chick and duck. Oh, me too.
你何必去  你不是四天都去喂他们012---Why would you need to say hi? You've been feeding them for four days.
没错  我回家好了012---Oh, right. Maybe I'll just go home.
只剩下我们两个012---Well, we certainly are alone.
幸好我们说好回纽约就不做的012---Yes! Good thing we have that "not New York" rule.
没错012---Right.
既然你说到这个012---Um, listen, since we're on that subject...
我想告诉你012---...um, I just wanted to tell you that, um...
当时我在伦敦心情很不好012---Well, I was going through a really hard time in London...
因为哥哥结婚  别人还把我认作他妈012---...what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.
我知道012---Right.
总而言之012---Well, anyway, I just...
那晚对我来说意义非凡  我的意思是  我要谢谢你012---That night meant a lot to me. And I guess I'm trying to say thanks.
这样012---Oh.
我那天也不是随便上床012---You know, that night meant a lot to me too.
并不是因为我心情不好012---And it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything.
我很重视那晚是因为  你很性感012---It just meant a lot to me because you're really hot.
这样说可以吗  没关系012---Is that okay? Ha, ha. That's okay.
而且我也很帅012---And I'm cute too?
而且你也很帅  谢谢012---And you're cute too. Thank you.
我要去整理行李了  好012---All right, I got to go unpack. Okay.
再见012---Bye.
我时差还没调回来  这表示我还在伦敦吧012---I'm still on London time. Does that count?
没错  太好了012---Oh, that counts. Oh, good.
瑞秋012---Rach.
嗨012---Rach. Hi.
你怎么会在这里012---What are you doing here?
我在等候补机位回纽约012---Well, I've been on standby for a flight home for hours.
你还没等到艾蜜莉012---Oh. Oh. So no sign of Emily, huh?
还没012---Not yet.
那么012---So, um...
你是几点的飞机012---What time are you supposed to leave?
最后一次呼叫  前往雅典的1066班机012---This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens.
最后一次呼叫012---The last call.
就快了012---Pretty soon, I guess.
我很遗憾012---I'm sorry.
我不明白她怎么可以这么做012---I just... I don't understand. I mean, how could she do this?
我是不是白痴012---What, am I like a complete idiot...
竟然以为她会来012---...for thinking she'd actually show up?
不是012---No.
你不是白痴   罗斯012---You're not an idiot, Ross.
你只是爱得无可救药012---You're a guy very much in love.
那还不是一样012---Same difference.
搭乘1066班机  前往雅典的旅客请登机012---All passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be onboard.
听到了012---I get it!
没戏了012---Well, that's that.
不  你知道什么啊012---No, you know what?

嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
早安  菲比  我非告诉你们不可012---Morning, Pheebs. I have to tell you this story.
刚才载我来的司机012---Okay, I was coming over and this cabdriver...
那人是不是叫做安格斯012---Was his name Angus?
什么012---What?
我们在伦敦碰到的计程车司机012---He was a cabdriver we had in London.
好吧  总之...012---All right. Anyway...
他载我们去的那个酒馆叫什么012---What was that pub he took us to?
麦子酒馆012---The Wheat Sheaf!
那里有一种啤酒012---And they had that beer...
伯丁罕  就是伯丁罕012---Boddington's. Boddington's.
菲比有话要说012---Ooh, uh, Pheebs was going to tell a story.
他的帽子很好笑012---Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat.
我不想说了012---I don't want to talk about it.
嘿  嘿  罗斯012---Hey. Hey, Ross!
伯丁罕012---Boddington's!
是啊012---Oh, man!
要是能再喝一杯  要我走回伦敦都行012---That was good beer. Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
世贸附近的英国酒馆好像有012---Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
回头见012---Later!
瑞秋不是该回来了吗012---Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
是啊  那趟班机在雅典误点了012---Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens.
不过  现在也该到了012---But actually, she should be here by now.
你跟她通过电话  她很生气吗012---Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
不会  那是因为她喜欢我012---No. But she likes me.
你丢她独自飞到希腊去012---You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
我才没有 "丢下" 瑞秋012---Okay, I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?
艾蜜莉出现在机场012---Emily showed up at the airport.
我当然得去追她  我别无选择012---I had to go after her. I mean, I-I did what I had to do!
她是我的太太  瑞秋是我太太012---She's my wife. Rachel is my wife.
是艾蜜莉012---Y'know—Emily!
艾蜜莉是我老婆012---Emily is my wife.
我这是怎么了012---Man, what is that?
你还没有艾蜜莉的消息012---So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
我在机场追丢之后就没有了012---No, Not since I lost her at the airport.
她竟然跑得比你快012---I can't believe she can out run you man!
她是飞毛腿  好吗012---Hey! She's fast, okay?
你以为你可以打击我   现在就出去单挑012---Oh! You think you can beat me? Let's go! Outside!
嗨012---Hi!
嗨   瑞秋012---Hi! Rachel!
瑞秋  我很抱歉  非常对不起你012---Rach, I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry.
别这样  你迫不得已012---Come on. You just did what you had to do.
嗨  菲比012---Hi, Pheebs.
就这样  你不生气  你一定很难受012---That's it? You're not mad? I mean, It must've been terrible.
难受   我到的可是希腊啊012---Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!
那儿有豪华的酒店  迷人的沙滩  人又和善012---There was a nice hotel, nice beach, met the nice people.
对我瑞秋来说可不差啊012---It's not too shabby for Rachel.
那  就这样了012---So, what, that's it?
对  我们和好了  我没生你的气012---Well, yeah. We're cool. Totally cool.
谢谢  瑞秋  你是最棒的012---Thanks, Rach. You're the best.
哦  不  你才是最棒的012---Oh, no. You're the best.
我要去花店一趟012---Oh, I got to go to the flower store.
看来  大家都不肯说艾蜜莉在哪里012---Check it out, No one will tell me where Emily is...
所以我决定买72朵长茎红玫瑰  寄到艾蜜莉爸妈家012---...so I'm gonna send 72 long-stemmed, red roses to her parents' house.
每朵代表我认识她   并且深爱她的每一天012---one for each day that I've known and loved her.
她一定会感动的012---That oughta get her talking to me again.
对了  罗斯  写卡片时别忘了  对方是 "艾蜜莉"012---Oh, Ross,When you make out the card, be sure to make it out to "Emily."
瑞秋  太棒了  幸好你在希腊玩得开心012---Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
什么012---What?
我在希腊才不开心012---I didn't have a good time in Greece!
罗斯丢下我一人012---Ross abandoned me!
我买不到机票回来  只好住在他们的蜜月套房012---Okay, I couldn't get a plane out. so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite
每个人都要来问我 "盖勒太太  你哭什么"012---with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying"
简直丢死人了012---I mean, it was so humiliating!
我就像个白痴012---I felt like such an idiot!
这都是我的错  你们知道为什么吗012---It's all my fault. And you know why,
因为我的决定都不对012---Because I make very bad decisions.
不要这么说012---Oh, that's not true.
就是这样  我没胡说  我跑去愚蠢的伦敦追罗斯012---Yes, it is true. I went,I went after Ross in stupid London!
伦敦的确是个蠢地方  太蠢012---London is stupid! Stupid!
菲比你是对的  我根本不该去伦敦012---Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London.
从今开始   由你帮我做决定012---and from now on, you make all my decisions for me.
不行  我以前就这么做过012---Oh, no. I did that for someone once.
我不喜欢主宰别人的生活012---I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
那我来012---I'll do it.
很好  摩妮卡  以后由你主宰我的感情生活012---That's fine. So Monica, you are now in charge of my love life.
好  我该去上班了012---Okay. I got to go to work.
瑞秋  很高兴看到你回来012---And, uh, Rachel, great to have you back.
菲比012---Pheebs!
看到你真开心012---Always a pleasure.
瑞秋  你看012---Rachel? Sweetie, look.
这是你跟乔伊在招待会的照片012---it's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
他已经结婚了012---Ohh, He's married.
罗斯结婚了  我到现在还不敢相信012---Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
亲爱的  抓旁边就好012---Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
看来我只好接受事实了012---I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it
这都要怪我012---I mean, it's my fault.
亲爱的  抓边上  指纹弄脏照片012---Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey!
天啊012---Oh, my God!
算了  我知道你心情低落012---Okay. That's okay. I know that you're very upset right now.
不是故意找我麻烦012---I know, I know that wasn't about me.
我看她就是跟她作对012---I bet it was about her a little.
你要是肯放下罗斯一分钟012---If you'd stop thinking about Ross for one minute...
就会发现这里到处有帅哥012---...you'd notice there are great guys everywhere.
你看  阿甘012---you look. Gunther.
他既善良又可爱012---He's nice. He's cute.
阿甘的确...012---Yeah. I guess Gunther is...
还有那边那个家伙012---What about that guy over there?
记得吗  你以前  跟他在柜台打情骂俏过012---Remember? That's the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
我不知道  我不知道012---Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
你现在就去跟他说话012---You're going to talk to him.
我们说好了  由我发号施今  我决定你去跟他说话012---Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
好吧012---All right.
你说了算  看来我只好照办012---You're the boss. I guess. I got to do what you tell me.
他听到这句话  肯定上钩012---Say that to him, and you're golden.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
菲比  伦敦的照片洗出来了012---Hey, Pheebs. We got our pictures back from London.
这张是所有人在伦敦塔拍的012---Here's all of us at the Tower of London...
大家都在照片中012---Here we all are.
有罗斯  乔伊  你...012---Yeah, There's Ross and Joey and you and...
和我012---And me.
你一定听烦我们说伦敦的事了012---y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
是我不好  因为我去不了012---No. I'm sorry. it's just because I couldn't be there.
我只能大着肚子  烦都快烦死了012---'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
可怜啊  真抱歉012---I'm sorry. Sorry.
怎么样  总之我们东扯西扯012---What happened? Well, y'know, A little of this, a little of that.
明天晚上要出去约会012---Got myself a date tomorrow night.
看吧  早告诉过你  你能忘了罗斯的012---See? Didn't I tell you? You're getting over Ross already.
滚出去012---Get out.
你怎么去了那么久012---What took you so long?
公事担搁了  不过我明天就辞职012---I got caught up at work. But I'm quitting tomorrow.
谢谢你邀我过来012---So thanks for having me over.
瑞秋012---Rach...
菲比012---Pheebs...
再见012---See you, man.
他发什么神经012---What the hell was that?
可能在伦敦学到的欧洲风俗012---Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.
那才不是欧洲风俗012---That's not European.
比较像法式热吻012---Well, It felt French.
我玩得好开心012---Oh God, I really had a good time.
我也是012---Yeah, me too.
那012---So...
到此为止012---I guess this is it.
是啊012---Yeah, um...
除非你想进来  好012---Unless you want to come inside? Yeah!
等等  我做不了主012---Oh, uh, wait a minute. You know what? I can't decide this.
等我一下012---Okay. Just hold on a second.
嗨012---Um, hi.
嗨012---Hi.
摩妮卡在吗  我有事要问她012---Is Monica around? I have to ask her something.
她去洗衣服012---Doing her laundry.
那是什么012---What's that?
我今天收到的包裹012---It came in the mail today.
72朵长茎红玫瑰012---it's uh, 72 long-stemmed, red roses.
每朵代表我认识她  并且深爱她的每一天012---One for each day that I've known and loved Emily...
却给剪成了碎片012---...cut up into mulch.
真是糟糕012---Oh, honey that's awful.
还好啦012---It's not so bad.
摩妮卡要用它来做香料012---Monica's going to make potpourri.
我要出去淋雨散散心012---I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.
外面没下雨012---It's not raining.
连老天都不赏脸012---I can't catch a break.
罗斯  你哪也别去  就坐这里012---Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. Sit right here.
我给你泡茶  然后我们聊聊012---I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out.
好吗012---All right?
好012---Okay.
大卫  怎么样012---Hey, Dave. Yeah.
听着  改天再请你进来  我的室友病得很重012---Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick.
好  再见012---Okay. Bye.
亲爱的  听着012---Honey, listen.
我知道事情感觉很糟012---I know things seem so bad right now..
看起来不会好012---...and that they won't get any...
我可以跟你谈谈吗012---Can I talk to for just a minute?
我掉了几只袜子012---I dropped some socks.
好的012---Yeah.
你想惹麻烦吗  你又想老调重弹  又想跳回去自找苦吃012---What is the matter with you? Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
你根本没掉袜子012---You did not drop any socks!
我刚碰到大卫  他说你打发他走012---I just ran into Dave, and he told me that you blew him off!
你给我听好012---I mean, You listen to me!
我要发号施令了  我要你离开罗斯去追大卫012---Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.
你到底想怎么样012---What the hell were you trying to do?
其实我想  我打算012---Well, ultimately I was trying, you know, I wanted...
告诉他我还爱他012---...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him..
什么  你不准说012---What? You cannot tell him that!
为什么  为什么不准012---Why? Why not?
大家都喜欢听到这种话012---People love to hear that!
这里由我做决定  我不准你说012---I make the decisions and I say no!
你知道吗  你不能帮我做决定   因为...012---Well, You know what? No, you don't make my decisions, because...
我要开除你012---...you're fired.
你不能开除我012---You can't fire me.
你的事情由我来决定  我说 "我没被开除"012---I make your decisions, and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
既然如此012---Well...
瑞秋  让我进去012---Rachel! Come on, let me in!
怎么了012---Having some trouble?
瑞秋把我锁在门外012---Rachel locked the door.
你肯亲我  我就帮你撞开012---I'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.
瑞秋  让我进去012---Rachel! Let me in!
谢谢012---Thank you.
瑞秋  我可以去外面跟你谈谈吗012---Rachel? Can I talk to you outside for a sec?
不可以012---No.
我真的有话要跟你说012---We really need to talk to you.
那就说啊012---Well, then talk.
那我就说了012---Okay, I will.
记得我们刚说你要做的事吗012---Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?
记得012---Yes.
什么事012---What thing?
瑞秋要去学摇摆舞012---Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.
我非常不赞成012---Which I think is a really stupid idea.
因为这种舞很危险  她一定学不会012---It's dangerous. she's never gonna get what she wants.
而且搞不好还会撞伤人012---And who knows who she might end up hurting?
摩妮卡说得对  摇摆舞有点危险012---Monica's right. Swing dancing can be tricky.
我要打电话012---I have to use the phone.
我要取消五只  送给艾蜜莉的熊宝宝012---I got to cancel those five, giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.
否则熊宝宝难逃死劫012---My God. Think of the massacre.
我就是要说012---I'm going to do it.
瑞秋  我知道你认为我疯了012---Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy.
但是在你告诉他之前  至少找到一个...012---But before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person...
同意你想法的人  我打赌你找不到  但是012---...who thinks it's a good idea. I bet you can't. But I…
拜托012---Please?
好吧012---All right. Fine.
乔伊  我已经进来了012---Joey! I'm in!
那好012---All right. Good deal.
菲比  嘿012---Pheebs! Hey! Pheebs!
菲比  怎样012---Uh, okay, Pheebs? Yeah?
你上次说你都不能去伦敦012---Um, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London ...
觉得自己遭到大家遗弃  如何012---...and you were feeling left out? Yeah.
我们对这事很愧疚012---Well, we all felt really bad about that so...
决定大家一起去旅行012---...we decided to take a little trip together.
太好了012---Oh, that's so nice!
太棒了  要去哪里012---How great! where? Where's the trip?
我们可以一起去野餐012---Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic...
就去中央公园   中央公园012---...in Central Park! Central Park?
对  大家一起去  一整天012---Yeah, All of us. All day.
什么鸟地方012---That sucks!
那根本不算旅行  我才刚从公园过来012---That's not a trip! I just came from the park!
大家去中央公园有什么好兴奋012---What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
好啊  就在我家旁边012---It's right by my house. All right!
我决定回家反省这个烂主意012---I'm going home to bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
等一下  热吻先生012---Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.
我一直想跟你讨论012---Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about...
你新学的欧洲民情012---...this whole, little, new European thing you've got going on.
你搞得我非常不自在012---and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable...
拜托  你别再亲了012---...and I just, you know, just stop it!
我只是想  介绍大家认识欧洲文化012---I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
只要不要介绍到我嘴里就好了012---That's fine. Just don't bring it in my mouth.
我都快吐了012---Makes me wanna puke!
各位  菲比来了012---Hey, everybody! Pheebs is here!
菲比  大家好012---Phoebe! Whoo! Okay. Whoo! Hi!
菲比  我们认为野餐的主意012---Okay, Pheebs, we decided that the picnic idea was a little...
实在是没什么意思  不去了012---It didn't have any... Well, it blew.
所以今天下午决定  到大西洋城012---So, we thought that this afternoon we'd all go away for the whole weekend...
去度周末012---...to Atlantic City.
大西洋城  太好了  谁想到的012---Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Whose plan was that?
我的012---Mine!
等等   是我提议的  错012---Wait. It was my plan. No...
我说我们应该想个新的计划012---...I said we needed a new plan.
然后我想到要去大西洋城012---And I came up with Atlantic City.
这就是新的计划啊012---Which is the new plan.
大家一小时后楼上见012---Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
好012---Okay.
我要去打包了  我要摇着大屁股好好打包012---I'm going to go pack. I'm going to go pack my ass off.
瑞秋  我们走吧012---Come on Rach, let's go.
我等一下再上去找你012---Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
不行  瑞秋  没有人支持你  所以你不能说012---No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone, so you can't tell him.
无所谓012---Well, You know what? That doesn't matter.
你知道对方不能回应你的爱意012---Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone you love them...
会有多痛苦吗012---...and not have them say it back?
我不在乎012---I don't care.
好吧012---Okay...
可是我看不下去012---I can't watch.
你在看什么012---What you reading?
报纸012---Paper.
上面说了什么012---Yeah? What's it about?
世界各地的新闻012---The events from around the globe.
是啊012---Okay...
我有件事要告诉你012---Uhh, Ross, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about
虽然大家都叫我别说012---and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you,
但是他们都错了  有时候别人就是看不清楚012---But I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
有一次上班时012---Sure. Once at work...
我说放射性碳测定法太老旧012---...I thought carbon dating is fossilized...
我真的有话跟你说012---I'm really trying to tell you something here.
说吧012---Go ahead.
我这就说了012---Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it.
现在就告诉你012---Just gonna say it. Uhh,
我还爱着你  罗斯012---I'm still in love with you, Ross.
嗯  我012---Huh. I'm...
我不知道现在该怎么回答012---Wow. Umm...Huh...I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
怎么了  你跟我开玩笑  这就太恶劣了012---What? Was that a joke? Because it's mean.
我很正经012---I'm so dead serious.
不能再正经了012---I'm totally serious.
那你笑什么012---Why are you laughing?
因为我刚听到自己的话012---Because I just heard it!
我听到了  而且觉得很荒谬012---I heard it! And it's ridiculous!
毕竟...012---I mean...
你已经结婚012---You're married!
你已经结婚  我说这话太可笑012---You're married, and it's just ridiculous.
我说话时似乎灵魂出壳012---and it's like, When I said it, I sort of floated up out of my body.
我的灵魂听到肉身说话012---y'know? And then I heard myself say it, and then the floating Rachel...
灵魂认为  自己实在很白痴012---I was like, "You are such an idiot!"
我的确已经结婚   我知道012---Well, I am married. I know.
虽然婚礼后就没跟老婆说过话012---Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
抱歉  这不好笑012---I'm sorry. That's not funny.
其实  还蛮好笑的012---Actually, it kind of is.
我老婆不回我电话012---My wife won't return my calls.
我不知道太太在哪里012---I don't know where my wife is.
"罗斯  你老婆呢 "  "我也不知道"012---"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?" "Don't know!"
天啊012---Oh, God.
好012---Okay.
你可以忘记我刚说的话吗012---You know what? do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
我不忘记也不行012---Well, I kind of have to.
因为事实是012---I mean, Because the thing is...
事实就是你已经娶了艾蜜莉012---The thing is, you know, that you're married to Emily.
事实正是如此012---That is what the thing is.
天啊012---Oh, God.
罗斯  我们还是好朋友吧  我说自己还爱你012---Ross, Things won't be weird between us, right? Was that stupid?
真是蠢死了012---Me telling you that?
不  不会  我很高兴你告诉我012---No, no. I'm glad you did.
就算日子不顺利012---Look, If nothing else...
听到有人说爱你还是很开心012---...it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
我早说过了012---That's what I said!
谢谢你对我这么好  我才该谢谢你012---Thank you for being so nice. No. Thank you for...
谢谢你012---Thank you.
大家走吧  去大西洋城012---Okay, let's go! Yeah, Atlantic City!
走吧012---Come on!
去大西洋城了  宝贝012---Atlantic City, baby!
我们去大赌一笔  乔伊012---Let's roll some bones. Hey, Joey!
赌博万岁012---High-five for rolling bones.
菲比  你尿失禁012---Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking.
天啊  你羊水破了012---Oh, my God. Your water broke.
对012---Oh! Okay!
别放在心上  我要坐前座012---Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.
菲比  我们得送你去医院012---Pheebs, we have to take you to the hospital now.
菲比   你快要生了012---Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
击掌   你要生了012---Honey! High-five! The babies are coming!
等等  记不记得  我羊水破的那天012---Wait, wait,Remember when my water broke?
菲比竟然快生了012---I can't believe Phoebe's going to have her babies.
我知道  真是太棒了012---I know. It's beautiful and amazing.
我竟然每次离开  都得亲菲比跟瑞秋012---Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left the room.
可惜她们没看到我们嘿咻012---I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
你到底了不了解女人012---Do you know anything about women?
不了解012---No.
算了  好012---It's all right. Okay.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你好  我是菲比布非  我就要生孩子了012---Hi. Yeah, hi. I'm, um, Phoebe Buffay and I have babies coming out.
好  开始阵痛了吗012---Okay. Have you started having contractions?
还没  听说会很痛  真的吗012---Not yet. Um, I heard they really hurt. do they hurt?
这么嘛  天哪012---Well... Oh, my God.
哪一位是父亲012---And now, Which of you is the father?
他们都不是  我弟才是012---Oh no, None of them are. The father is my brother.
好012---Okay.
我一定会很怀念你那样吓别人的方式012---I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
菲比012---Okay, uh Pheebs,
快看这里  这是要给宝宝看的012---Look! This is for the babies to look at someday.
在生产前你有什么话要说的吗012---so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
好012---Okay. Um...
孩子们  是我  菲比姑姑012---Hi, kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe.
真想赶快见到你们  请不要弄痛我012---Can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me.
你们怎么那么慢012---What took you so long?
两辆车是一起出发的012---Your cab left when ours did.
我们回去拿我的外套012---We went back because I forgot my jacket.
你没穿外套啊012---You-you're not wearing a jacket.
真是的  我又忘了012---Oh, man! I did it again!
得有人通知法兰克和爱丽丝012---Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice.
我妈也想  乔伊  你干什么012---And then My mom might... Joey, What are you doing?
我得拍些生产前的镜头啊012---I've got to get the before shot.
老友记  第五季  第03集  三胞胎012---Friends  S05E03  The One Hundredth
菲比  我们问过护士了  你的医生之所以迟到012---Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse. The reason your doctor is late...
是因为她不来了012---...is because, uh, she's not coming.
什么  实际上是她洗澡的时候摔破了头012---What? Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
天哪  那个蠢女人012---Oh, my God. She's so stupid!
菲比  不会有事的012---Pheebs-Pheebs it's going to be okay.
你说得倒轻松  你的阴道又没有3个宝宝要出来012---That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out of your vagina.
听着  护士说这个医生很好012---Listen. y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
对  他是妇产科主任012---Yeah, He's head of the department.
好吧  老天爷救救我012---All right. Ooh. Oh, dear God, save me.
第一次阵痛来了012---I'm having my first contraction.
还好嘛  好012---Oh, it's not bad. Okay.
生命的奇迹开始了  哎呦  我012---And so the miracle of birth begins. And I...
你没事吧012---You okay?
有个地方好痛012---Something hurts.
是感同身受   好感人喔012---Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Oh, that's so sweet.
我不知道我有那么在意012---Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
你好  你好012---Hello. Hi.
菲比  我是哈洛医生  我负责替你接生012---Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad. I'll be delivering your babies.
有我在你放心  我是老手了012---I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time.
我马上回来帮你做检查012---I'll be back in a minute to do your internal,
你先放轻松   目前一切都很好012---in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great.
还有  我爱方奇(电视剧Happy Days里的人物)012---And also, I love Fonzie.
他刚才说他爱方奇吗012---Did he just say he loves Fonzie?
听起来是012---That's what it sounded like.
好012---All right.
嘿012---Hey!
我来晚了吗  还没有人出来吧012---Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
没有  还没开始呢   爱丽丝呢012---No-no-no! we haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
在德拉威  不过她正在赶来  目前先由我充当教练012---Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach.
放心  她有教我心理助产什么的012---But don't worry, She told me about the LaMazda stuff.
就是在月底前生产012---Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month..
就能获得2％的补助012---...they give you 2% financing.
对012---Yeah.
摩妮卡  你一定会以我为荣012---Monica, you're going to be very proud of me.
我帮我们约到两个俏护士012---I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
喔  是吗012---Oh, my.
是男看护012---They're male nurses.
在我想像中不是012---Heh, heh. Not in my head.
不管怎样  他们约我们周六晚上出去  如何012---Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night. What do you say?
这个012---Um...
我看算了  什么012---I don't think so. What?
什么叫算了012---What are you talking about?
是你劝我忘记罗斯向前看的012---You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
我向前看了  你得陪我012---I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on,
给我一个好的理由  你为什么不去012---give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
不如你说一个理由012---Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason ...
我再告诉你是对是错012---...and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
什么  没那么简单吧012---What? Harder than it sounds, isn't it?
总之你也要去  我还答应他们下班012---Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off ...
一起到咖啡厅吃点儿果冻012---...that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
没错  人永远吃得下果冻012---Yep. There's always room for Jello.
你为什么能说得那么色012---Joey, how do you make that dirty?
很简单  我什么都能说得很色012---It's easy. I can do it with anything. Watch uh,
奶奶的鸡肉沙拉012---Grandma's chicken salad...
罗斯012---Ross!
拍这里012---Get a shot of this.
这是你们出生当天的头条012---Hey, babies, these are the headlines when you were born.
女宝宝把头转开  男宝宝012---Okay, now girl baby, turn away. And boy babies...
看看012---...check it out.
这就是你出生当月的裸女012---This is what naked women looked like the month you were born.
好的  尽情欣赏吧012---All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff
好  阵痛又来了012---Oh, okay, I'm having another one!
我有点希望已经生了012---Ooh, I was kind of hoping that was it.
摩妮卡和瑞秋呢012---Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
可能跟约她们的护士在一起012---A couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
是吗  男看护012---Really? Male nurses?
对  我也很失望012---Yeah, I was bummed too.
她们要去约会012---So they're going on dates?
什么时候  星期六吧012---When? I think Saturday.
他怎么了  他感同身受012---What's with him? Um, sympathy pains.
我本来挺感动的  可是现在我觉得他在抢我的风头012---I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's trying to steal my thunder.
好012---Okay.
来看看你怎么样了012---Let's see what we got here.
你知道吗  方奇跟三胞胎约过会012---Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.
你一直提到的这位方奇012---This-this Fonzie person you keep referring to...
他是另一位医生吗012---...is that another doctor?
不是012---Oh no-no-no.
方奇是亚瑟方塞瑞利的昵称012---Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli.
也叫方子012---The Fonz.
好012---All right.
很快了012---Soon.
其实不会很怪吧012---It's not that weird, is it?
怪得不得了012---It's very weird.
我才不要听某人告诉我  我扩张了"一滴滴"012---I don't want some guy down there telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."
老实说  他不是在模仿方奇012---To be fair, He doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
干嘛替他辩解  去帮我另外找一个012---Why are you defending him? Just get me another doctor...
没有发疯  不是方奇的医生012---...One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
其实他不是012---Again, it's not that he…Aah! Aah!
你在这里012---Oh-hey-hey-hey! there you are.
有件事应该让你知道012---Um, listen there's something I think you should know.
是你要跟护士约会的事吗  我听乔伊说了012---Is this about you dating the nurse? Joey told me.
我一点也不在意  你和我又没什么012---and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing
我们只是玩玩012---Just goofing around.
其实我是想告诉你  我打算推掉012---Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it,
既然我们只是玩玩  那我就跟他出去好了012---but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
好  那我也要012---Fine. Maybe I will too.
喂  你们看我去礼品部012---Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the gift shop...
起来  快起来012---Oh. Get up! Get up! Get up!
菲比012---Okay, Pheebs?
这是欧伯曼医生012---This is Dr. Oberman.
他对方奇或《欢乐时光》 的所有人物...012---He has no strong feelings about Fonzie...
都没什么感觉012---...or any of the Happy Days gang.
你要升几年级012---Hi! you're going into what grade?
我刚升住院医师  常有人那样问我  我提前...012---I'm actually a first-year resident. but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early…
我也是012---Uh-huh. Me too.
罗斯  或许我应该强调  我是要已成年的医师012---Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
我绝对有能力012---Really, I'm fully qualified...
闭嘴012---Shh, Doogie. Shh.
到底有没有人了解我快生了012---Doesn't anybody understand that I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh?
你走  走啊  小毛头012---Go! Go little boy, go!
你真行  你把他弄哭了012---Oh, cool. You made him cry!
崔比亚尼先生  你有肾结石012---Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
有别的可能吗012---Uh, well, what else could it be?
就是肾结石012---It's kidney stones.
或是...012---Or...
肾结石012---Kidney stones.
差不多了012---All right, You're getting there.
这些宝宝很幸运012---Oh, and y'know, These babies are very, very lucky.
是吗  为什么012---They are? Why?
他们的生日日期是方子的一半012---They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
生日快乐012---Happy birthday.
我澄清一下012---Just to clarify.
我不是方奇012---I'm not Fonzie.
说真的  你能替你弟生孩子真的很棒012---Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you,I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
的确  对啊012---I know, it is. Yeah.
我可以告诉你个秘密吗  你说012---Can I tell you a little secret? Yeah.
我要自己留一个012---I want to keep one.
天哪   我会上新闻012---Oh, I'm going to be on the news.
菲比  别开玩笑了012---Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding.
你明知你不能这么做012---You know you can't keep one of these babies.
为什么  搞不好可以  你怎么知道012---Why not? Maybe I can. You don't know.
我当然知道  法兰克他们一定三个都要012---Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice will want to keep all their children.
不一定  你确定012---Maybe not. You know?
说实话  三个宝宝很费事的012---Seriously, three babies are a handful.
也许他们正在找机会送走一个012---maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them.
我不想因为没开口而失去机会012---Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity because I didn't ask.
菲比  这件事太扯了012---Phoebe, no. This is insane.
你就问问看嘛012---Just ask him.
什么  我去问012---What? Me?
我不能自己问012---I can't ask him!
你知道那样多不成体统吗012---Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?
总之你去找法兰克谈  好嘛012---All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank. Okay?
探探他的口风012---Just, y'know, feel him out!
不行  我怎么能叫法兰克  送你一个孩子012---No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids.
你说得对012---You're right.
就说是你要的012---Tell him it's for you.
好一点了吗  亲爱的012---Feeling better, sweetie?
一点点吧012---Maybe a little.
真希望你没看到我吐012---Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
我也希望012---Me too.
我刚刚听说  怎么回事012---Hey. I just heard. What's up?
肾结石012---Kidney stones.
通常我们会用冲击波震碎结石012---Ordinarily, Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break the stones up with shock waves.
但你的结石已经太靠近膀胱012---But they're too close to the bladder now.
我们要不要等你排尿排出来  或是从尿道往上伸进去012---Which means we can either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
不  不行  不能往上伸012---No, no, no. Nothing is going "up," okay?
绝对不考虑往上   尿道是什么012---"Up" is not an option. What's a urethra?
你疯了吗012---Are you crazy?
你问他了吗012---So did you ask him?
我还没有机会跟他独处012---No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
我的时间有限012---I'm kind of on a clock here.
方奇012---Oh, Fonzie.
我一直都很喜欢魔克012---You know who I always liked? Mork.
收回  收回012---Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
方奇过见魔克012---Fonzie met Mork.
魔克把方奇结冻012---Mork froze Fonzie.
对012---Yeah...
对012---Yes...
但是方奇本来就很酷"冷"012---...but Fonzie was already cool.
所以他不会有事  对吧012---So he wasn't hurt. Right?
也对012---Yeah, that's right.
你好吗012---How you doing?
很好  医生说随时都会生012---Okay. Doctor says any minute now.
爱丽丝马上就会到012---You know, Alice is going to be here so soon.
你能不能帮个忙  先hold住他们012---You couldn't just do me a favor and, like, hold them in?
抱歉  我正在处理你请我帮的最后一个忙012---Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
嘿  瑞秋  嗨012---Hey, Rachel. Hi!
摩妮卡  他是丹  我们星期六的男伴之一012---Monica. This is Dan, one of the guys we're going out with on Saturday.

你是护士不是医生012---Nurse, not a doctor, huh?
有点娘娘腔  对吧012---Kind of girlie, isn't it?
钱德  没关系012---Chandler. That's okay.
这只是为了挣钱  好上完医学院012---I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
而且海湾战争时  感觉没那么娘娘腔012---And it didn't feel "girlie" during the Gulf War.
那当然012---Sure.
感谢你保家卫国012---Thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
何必等到星期六  你明天有空吗012---So, Why wait till Saturday? Are you free tomorrow?
行啊  我找人代班012---Sure. I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
太好了012---Aw, great.
我们星期六  你我  去约个会如何012---Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
不要  很好012---No. All right, very good!
这一回很痛012---This is a big one.
把它弄出来012---Unh! Get these things out of me!
深呼吸   深呼吸可以止痛012---Breathe! Breathe through the pain.
我想吃止痛药  罗斯  我想吃止痛药012---I want the drugs, Ross! I want the drugs!

她早就该到了012---She should be here by now!
放心  她会赶上的012---Oh, honey, She's gonna make it on time.

对012---Yeah.

天哪012---Oh, my God.

你要看看它们吗012---Would you like to see them?
好小喔012---They're so small.
我明天跟你联络  好012---So, I'll call you tomorrow. Great.
你真的要跟那个护士男约会012---So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
你和我只是玩玩012---Well uh, You and I are just "goofing around."
我当然也可以跟他玩玩012---I thought, why not "goof around" with him?
我不知道你有没有查过字典  玩玩这个词呢012---Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary
我有012---Well, I have...
"玩玩"的定义是012---...and the technical definition is:
"两个好朋友  非常在乎对方012---"Two friends who care a lot about each other...
在床上很"性"福012---...and have amazing sex...
而且想多跟对方相处012---...and just want to spend more time together."
如果你用的是让你生气的版本012---But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, ...
那我们应该买我的版本给你012---...then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.
我实在很不会012---I am so bad at this.
比你想像的要好  真的012---I think you're better than you think you are. Really?

好012---Yeah.
你们都在了012---So here you are.
我对着培养皿跟你们说话  彷佛是昨天的事012---Seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish.
大家都说生产最难熬012---Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do,
其实跟你们分开才是012---But they were wrong. This is.
这段日子真的很开心012---Well, I had the most fun with you guys.
真想带你们回家  每天看着你们012---I wish I could take you home and see you every day.
我就当你们最喜欢的姑姑吧012---Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite aunt.
爱丽丝的妹妹家有游泳池  但你们在我肚子里游过012---I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me.
那就这样了012---Okay, so we're cool.
我们会处得很好012---We're going to be great.
小击掌012---Little high-fives.
既然你都哭了012---Well, if you're going to cry...
菲比  我们好以你为荣  你真了不起012---Phoebe, we are so proud of you. You're amazing!
我知道012---I know.
真的有那么痛吗012---So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
当然了  你绝对受不了012---Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
既然小钱德是个女生  他们打算叫她什么012---So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
就叫她钱德012---They'll call her Chandler.
这个名字有点男性化吧  你们012---Kind of a masculine name, don't you ...
你都能用了012---Works on you.
进来012---Come in.
我等你很久了012---I've been waiting for you.
我只是...012---Hi, I just...

亲切版帅哥服务生012---The one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
就是他012---Aha. That one!
我马上就闪人  我只是回来拿件外套012---Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just going to grab a jacket.
等我回来  可要告诉我详情012---When I get back, I want every little detail.
他可能来了012---Maybe that's him.
好的  好的012---Okay, um... Okay, um...
只是乔伊跟罗斯012---It's just Joey and Ross.
你们不是去看电影吗012---Why aren't you at the movie?
对啊  可是罗斯打电话太吵  被电影院轰出来了012---We were, but Ross was talking so loud on his phone, they threw us out.
电影太吵  我当然得大声讲012---I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
他打电话去伦敦  天啊  找到艾蜜莉了012---He's talking to London. My God.Did he get in touch with Emily?
还没  他打给女方所有的亲戚012---Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family
希望有人愿意帮他联络艾蜜莉012---...hoping someone will help him get in touch with her.
就算我说错名字又怎样  你这大惊小怪的笨蛋012---I don't care if I said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
罗斯012---Ross.
你给人家拍马屁拍得可真好啊012---Way to suck up to the family!

老友记  第五季  第04集  菲比讨厌PBS（美国广播公司）012---Friends  S05E04  The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS
嘿  别过来  那是呕吐西装012---Hey Oh, no, no! Vomit tux! No, no! Vomit tux!
放心  我干洗过了012---Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
呕吐西装012---Vomit tux?
谁会吐在...012---Who vomited on...
算了  乔伊  你为何穿成这样012---You know what? What you up to, Joe?
我要上马拉松式电视节目012---They're doing this telethon thing on TV.
我的经纪人帮我争取当主持人012---And my agent got me a job as co-host!
太棒了012---That's great!
帮公视做好事  又能增加曝光率012---A little good deed for PBS, plus some TV exposure.
我乔伊最爱做这种美事了012---That's the kind of math Joey likes to do.
公视啊012---Oh, PBS!
公视哪里不对了  他们哪里对012---What's wrong with PBS? What's right with them?
你为何不喜欢公视012---Why don't you like PBS?
因为我妈自杀之后  我孤苦伶仃非常难过012---Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself,I was just in this really bad place, you know, personally.
所以我想写信给《芝麻街》  心情应该会好一点012---So I just thought it would make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street.
因为我小时候  总觉得他们很亲切012---Because they were so nice when I was a little kid.
结果根本没人回信012---No one ever wrote back.
那些布偶根本没有手指  写不了信012---Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
我只收到一个烂钥匙环  拜托  我那时住在纸箱里012---All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.
连钥匙都没有012---I didn't have keys!
我很遗憾  菲比  我只是012---I'm sorry, Pheebs.I just wanted to
想做好事  就像你帮忙生小孩012---do a good deed, like you did with the babies.
你才不是做善事012---This isn't a good deed.
只是想上电视  根本就很自私012---You just want to get on TV. This is totally selfish.
你帮弟弟生小孩又怎么说012---What about you having those babies for your brother?
自私的不是只有我012---Talk about selfish!
你胡说什么012---What are you talking about?
你的确是帮忙他们  不过自己心情也很好吧012---Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
那又如何012---Yeah, so?
因为你做善事心情好  也算是自私的一种012---It made you feel good so that makes it selfish.
世界上根本就没有无私的好事012---Look, there's no unselfish good deeds. Sorry.
明明就有  有很多行善的人都没有私心012---Yes, there are totally good deeds that are selfless!
请你举出一个例子012---May I ask for one example?
就是有  例如012---Yeah, it's... You know, there's...
我不想说012---No, you may not!
因为所有人都很自私012---That's because all people are selfish.
你说我自私012---Are you calling me selfish?
你难道不是人012---Are you calling you people?
菲比  很抱歉戳破你的美梦  世界上没有无私的善事012---Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist.
好吗012---Okay?
你也知道圣诞老人吧  对吧012---And you know the deal on Santa Claus, right?
我一定会找到一件无私的善事  打败你这个  邪恶博士012---I'm gonna find a selfless good deed. I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!
喂  罗斯吗012---Hello? Hello, Ross?
艾蜜莉012---Emily?
天啊   是艾蜜莉012---Oh, my God! Oh my God, It's Emily!
各位  是艾蜜莉  别吵012---It's Emily, everyone! Shh! Shh! Shh!
罗斯  我打来只是要告诉你  别再骚扰我家人了  再见012---Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.
等一下  就算你挂断  我也会继续打  如果要打给所有英国人012---Wait! Okay,Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England
才能逼你跟我说话  我也办得到012---if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
真的  你想谈什么012---Really? About what?
你是我太太  我们已经结婚012---Look, you're my wife. We're married.
而且我爱你012---You know, I love you.
我很想你012---I really miss you.
我也很想你012---I miss you too.
至少我认为如此012---Well, at least I think I do.
她肯跟我说话了012---She's talking.
嘿  乔伊  你刚刚  为何提到圣诞老人012---Hey, Joey, When you said "the deal with Santa Claus," you meant?
根本没有这号人物012---That he doesn't exist.
这样啊012---Right.
钱德  你听说  摩妮卡的地下情人了吗012---So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
知道  她...她是提过012---Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she might have mentioned him.
我们到底何时  才能认识这个服务生012---So, Mon, when are we going to meet this new, secret waiter man?
他很害羞  我想现在还没准备  认识大家吧012---He's really shy. I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
我想他还没准备好012---Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
我不管  我想见他  她说他床上功夫一级棒012---I don't care, I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had.
真的012---Really?
有这样的评论  你说过012---That's what you heard? You said that?
大概吧012---I might have said that.
这有什么好笑012---Why is that funny?
因为我为他高兴012---Because I'm very happy for him.
你真是  走狗运012---And you! You lucky dog!
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
艾蜜莉愿意跟我破镜重圆012---Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
太好了  好啊012---That's great! Yes!
在伦敦啊012---In London.
什么  她要我搬到伦敦去012---What? She wants me to move to London.
可是你住在这里012---But you live here.
我这是废话012---You know that.
你打算怎么办012---What-what-what are you gonna do?
只要跟卡萝  苏珊谈谈012---I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...
一定能说服她们带小班搬到伦敦012---...I could convince them to move to London with Ben.
想必你前妻一定乐意搬到国外去012---I'm sure your ex-wife would be more than happy to move to another country...
帮你挽回新太太012---...so you can patch things up with your new wife.
不是不可能啊012---It could happen.
你好  欢迎  幸会012---How you doing? Welcome. Good to see you.
这就是你的电话012---This'll be your phone.
真好012---That's great.
不过应该没有人会打来找我012---But I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
你负责接电话接受捐款012---No, you answer it and take pledges.
我是主持人012---But I'm the host.
不  盖瑞卡林才是主持人  你负责接电话012---No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phone.
你恐怕搞不清楚状况  我是雷莫瑞医生012---You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.
你负责这支电话  医生012---Well, here's your phone, doctor.
我竟然找不到一件无私的善行012---I can't believe I can't find a selfless good deed.
以前我家隔壁有个老头012---You know that really old guy that lives next door to me?
我偷溜到他家  帮他打扫前廊的落叶012---I snuck over there and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop.
他捉到我之后  强迫我喝西打  吃饼干012---But he caught me, and he force-fed me cider and cookies.
可是我却很开心  那个呆子012---Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
或许乔伊说得对  所有好事的出发点都有私心012---Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
我一定要找到一件无私的善行  毕竟我才刚生出三个宝宝012---I will find a selfless good deed. Because I just gave birth to three children...
不能让他们在  乔伊认为有理的世界里长大012---...and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey's right!
摩妮卡  可以问你有关烹饪的问题吗012---Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
当然  如果你用炉子烹饪012---Sure. If you're cooking on the stove...
是否代表你新的地下男友在床上  比理查还厉害012---...does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
钱德012---Chandler.
有吗012---Is he?
我要尊重秘密新男友的隐私012---Well, y'know I think I'm going to respect the privacy of my new, secret boyfriend.
为什么012---Why?
如果我是他012---I mean If this guy was me...
又知道  自己是你碰过最棒的情人012---...and it's me who'd learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had...
我一定会手舞足蹈的012---...I'd be going like this
好吧  艾蜜莉012---All right, Emily.
虽然我很爱你012---As much as I love you...
但是我不能丢下小班去伦敦012---...I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
我知道这很为难你012---I understand that would be difficult.
请你考虑搬过来好吗   你本来就打算搬来012---Would you please consider moving here? I mean You were moving here anyway.
为何不现在就来呢012---Why can't you just do that?
我不知道  只是012---I don't know. It's just...
好  我知道自己到目前为止  表现都这样白痴012---Okay, okay, but I know that even though I've been a complete idiot up till now...
但是你还是应该过来012---...you have to come here.
过来嘛  我们才能继续走下去012---You have to, so we can work this out together.
好吧012---All right.
好吧  你刚说 "好吧"012---All right? Did you just say "all right"?
没错  现在换我是白痴了012---I did. Now I'm the idiot.
艾蜜莉  太棒了012---Emily, that is so great!
会很棒的012---It's gonna be so great!
我们就像坠入爱河的一对白痴012---We're going to be like two idiots in love!
罗斯  有件是还是让我很担心012---Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
你尽管说  你要知道012---Yes, tell me. You have to understand...
当天婚礼我在012---...how humiliating it was for me up on that altar...
亲朋好友面前有多丢脸012---...in front of my entire family, all my friends.
我知道  我非常抱歉012---I know. I am so sorry.
当我决定原谅你012---And then, after deciding to forgive you...
却看到你跟她赶着上飞机012---...seeing you at the airport, catching our plane with her.
这也是我的错012---Again, very sorry.
我根本无法与她共处一室012---I mean, I can't be in the same room as her.
我光想到你跟她共处一室  就快气坏了012---It drives me mad thinking of you being in the same room as her.
艾蜜莉  我跟瑞秋根本没什么012---Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me.
好吗012---Okay?
我爱的是你012---I love you.
好吧012---All right.
我去纽约  我们再试试看012---I'll come to New York and we'll try to make this work.
太好了012---That is so great!
只要你答应不再见瑞秋012---As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
我就问艾蜜莉愿不愿意来纽约012---So I asked Emily if she would come to New York.
她答应了012---And she said yes.
太好了  不  不  不012---Yes! Ooh-ohh! No, no, no.
条件是我不准再见瑞秋012---Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
什么  那怎么行012---What? You can't...
你怎么说012---What did you tell her?
我说在考虑012---I told her I'd have to think about it.
我到底该怎么决定012---I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?
我这是在问你们012---I'm actually asking you!
你不能就此不见瑞秋012---Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore.
她是你的好朋友012---She's one of your best friends.
但是他也不能不见艾蜜莉  她是他老婆012---But he can't not see Emily, I mean that's his wife!
也是  对012---That's true! Yeah, right?
你跟瑞秋从高中就认识  不能说不见就不见012---But you've known Rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
你说得也对  的确不行012---That's true! No, you cannot.
谢谢你们的帮忙  问题一点也没解决012---Thanks for the help. Problem solved!
喂  摩妮卡012---Hello? Hey, Mon.
乔伊  我们看了一整天电视  你到底何时才会出现012---Oh, hey, Joey. We've been watching all day. When are you gonna be on TV?
我经纪人搞错了012---See, There was kind of a mix-up in my agent's office...
反正我上了电视   就有曝光率012---...but I'm still on TV, and that's good exposure.
你没上电视啊012---You're not on TV.
好吧  现在呢012---Oh, okay. How about now?
有了  看到他了012---Yeah! There he is! There he is!
嗨  纽约012---Hello, New York!
问题是这里有整只鸭  不过管他的012---Now maybe just put the whole duck right in there. Who cares? y'know?
我先处理鸭腿012---Now I got the legs.
我说过多少次  不准看烹饪频道012---How many times have I told you guys to never watch the cooking channel?
嗨  钱德  嘿012---Hi, Chandler. Hey.
我来要回乔伊上次借的烤盘012---Listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
那是你的012---That was yours?
我们上次用来装小鸭吐出来的虫子012---We used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.

整个家里就只有我们两个012---We have the whole place to ourselves.
那又如何012---Yeah, so?
或许你想跟最佳情人  预约时间约会012---Well I just, thought maybe you'd want to book some time with "the best you've ever had."
你知道吗  冠军先生012---You know what, champ?
我自愿放弃012---I think I'll pass.
为什么  为什么012---Why? Why?
什么意思012---What's your point?

乔伊012---Hey, Joey.
告诉你  我找到无私的善行了012---I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed.
我刚去公园   让蜜峰叮我012---I went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
什么  这对谁有好处012---What good is that going to do anybody?
这只蜜峰在同伴面前  脸上有光012---It helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends.
蜜峰很开心  我却很痛012---The bee is happy, and I am definitely not.
蜜峰叮了你就死了012---You know, the bee probably died after he stung you.
可恶012---Damn it!
各位  30秒后开始录影012---Back on in 30 seconds, people!

并告诉我们的义工  阁下喜欢收看哪类型节目012---...and at that time tell one of our volunteers what type of programming you...
好012---Okay.
够了  我下不了决心  实在太难了012---That's it. I cannot make this decision. It is too difficult.
我决定交给命运之神012---So I'm just going leave it entirely up to the gods of fate.
神奇8号球012---A Magic 8 Ball?
你开玩笑吧  怎么可以用玩具决定命运012---You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
这可不是玩具012---Ooh, it's not a toy.
我别无选择012---I don't know what else to do!
不是追回老婆  失去好朋友012---I either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends...
就是留下朋友  在30岁前离婚两次012---...or I keep my friend and get divorced for the second time before I'm 30.
要是有人有更好的建议  现在就说出来012---So if anyone else has a better suggestion, let's hear it.
否则我真的没有办法  大家别害羞012---Because I got nothing! Don't be shy.
各种建议都可以012---Any suggestion will do.
好吧012---Okay, then.
开始了012---Here we go.
神奇8号球012---Magic 8 Ball...
我是不是不该再见瑞秋012---...should I never see Rachel again?
"待会再问"012---"Ask Again Later."
这算什么答案012---Later is not good enough!
"待会再问"012---"Ask Again Later."
见鬼了012---What the hell?
这东西坏掉了  不灵了012---This is broken! It is broken!
我来看看012---Let me see.
钱德今晚会跟女人上床吗012---Will Chandler have sex tonight?

公视电视募款012---PBS Telethon.
嗨   乔伊012---Hi, Joey.
嗨   菲比012---Hey, Pheebs.
我要捐钱012---I'd like to make a pledge.
我想捐200元012---I would like to donate $200.
200元012---Two hundred dollars?
你确定  菲比  《芝麻街》可是伤你不浅啊012---Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
我还是很生气  不过我也知道很多妈妈012---I'm still mad at them, but I also know that they bring happiness...
没自杀的小孩很爱看012---...to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves.
你知道的  所以012---You know, so...
为了支持这节目  我决定做件好事  不过我自己可不开心012---...by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it.
你看  这就是无私的善行012---So there! A selfless good deed.
难道你捐钱没有一点开心012---And you don't feel a little good about donating the money?
难过死了  我本想用那笔钱买只黄金鼠012---No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
黄金鼠那种宠物  10元就买得到012---A hamster? Those things are, like, 10 bucks.
我喜欢的那只可没那么便宜012---Not the one I had my eye on.
看来今年的募款  已经超过去年总额012---It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total.
谢谢各位012---Thank you!
打破纪录的捐款是由  我们的义工募得012---And the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers.
而且这位还穿得很体面的012---Oh, boy! And may I say, one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.
这位就是  乔伊崔比亚尼012---Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
你看012---Oh, look!
乔伊上电视了012---Joey's on TV!
太棒了012---Isn't that great?
我的捐款让乔伊上了电视  真是让我012---My pledge got Joey on TV! That makes me feel so...
糟糕012---Oh, no!
好的012---Look...
或许我先前太得意了  不过有件事要告诉你012---...maybe I got carried away before, but there's something you gotta know.
如果我表现得很好  也是因为你012---If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.
说下去012---Keep talking.
跟你在一起之前  我根本表现平平012---I was nothing before you.
你可以打去问我以前那些女友012---Call the other girls and ask.
你一定很快就问完了012---Which wouldn't take long.
但是我跟你在一起时012---But when I'm with you, and we're together...
我的天啊012---...oh, my God!
真的  天啊012---Really? Oh, my God!
如果你不想再跟我上床  我也能体谅012---Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again.
不过这决定就不对了012---But that would be wrong.
我们太厉害了012---We're too good.
不上床实在太可惜012---We owe it to sex!
如果真这样012---Well, if we owe it!
天啊012---Oh, my!
乔伊什么时候回来012---When is Joey gonna be home?
我们应该不需要等他回来了012---I was kind of hoping we could do this without him.
没关系  手套不用脱012---No, no, no! Leave the gloves on.
可是我刚在清厕所012---But I just cleaned the bathroom.
脱掉吧  好012---Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves? Yeah.
让大家看看  谁才是高手012---All right. Let's show them how it's done.
好012---Okay. Ow!
这不包括在内  我知道012---Y'know that wasn't part of it? I know.
嗨  准备好没  我们要迟到了012---Hi. You ready? We're going to be late.
迟到什么  史黛拉啊  你没忘吧012---For what? For Stella, remember?
还有20多分钟就开演了012---She's getting her groove back in 20 minutes.
我完全忘记了012---Yeah, I totally forgot about that.
你不介意我爽约一次吧  我正在等艾蜜莉的电话012---Mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
没关系012---Sure, I guess.
听说你不用去伦敦了  真好012---Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay.
事情没那么简单  我们还有很多问题012---It's not that easy. There's still a lot of relationship stuff.
例如012---Like what?
就是一些问题012---Just stuff.
艾蜜莉对我有些要求012---You know, kind of what Emily wants.
你可以告诉我  或许我帮得上忙012---Well, Why don't you talk to me about it? Maybe I can help.
不行  你帮不上忙012---No, no, you can't help.
我的意思是  这件事你帮不上忙012---I mean, I kind of have to do this without your help.
那我012---Well, I...
我知道你自己办得到  但是如果你想找人谈谈012---I know you can do that too. I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to...
嗨012---Hi.
谢了012---Thanks.
罗斯  无论艾蜜莉有何要求012---Ross, look, whatever this relationship stuff is that Emily wants...
你答应就是了012---...just give it to her.
最重要的是你爱她012---The bottom line is that you love her.
她怎么要求  你就怎么做012---So just fix whatever she wants fixed.
答应就对了012---Just do it.
你总得试试看  不试试以后一定会后悔012---You're going to have to try. You'll just hate yourself if you don't.
快接电话啊  我都快被逼疯了012---Come on, answer it! It's driving me crazy.
喂012---Hello?
亲爱的012---Hi, sweetie.
我很好012---Good.
对  我有考虑过012---Look. Yes, I've been thinking...
你的要求012---...about that thing you wanted me to do...
我办得到012---...and I can do it.
你愿意来纽约吗012---So will you come to New York?
怎么样012---What?
以前没试过这招  我也没有012---Never done that before. Nope.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey
摩妮卡012---Monica?
现在几点了012---What time is it?
9点012---Uh, 9.
可是外面还很黑012---But it's dark out.
那是因为你老是睡到中午  傻瓜012---Um, well, that's because you always sleep till noon, silly.
9点就是这么黑012---This is what 9 looks like.
那我该梳洗一下012---I guess I'll get washed up then.
准备看日出012---Watch that sunrise.
我不想再偷偷摸摸了012---I'm really getting tired of sneaking around all the time.
我知道  我也是  不然我们  去外面度周末  就没人打扰我们012---I know, me too. Hey, Y'know what if we went away for the whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions
还可以赤身裸体整个周末012---And we could be naked the entire time.
整个周末  暴露个够012---All weekend? That's a whole lot of naked.
我就说去开会  你就说去参加厨师研讨012---Yeah, I could say I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
我一直想参加泽西州的烹饪大会012---Oh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey!
不过  你去的不是那里012---Ha, ha, okay. You know you're not, though.
对  好  走吧012---Right. Okay. Let's go.
等等  乔伊怎么办012---Wait. What about Joey?
老友记  第五季  第05集  谁进谁出012---Friends  S05E05  The One With All the Kips
你们知道我这周末要干嘛吗012---Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend.
去纽泽西参加烹饪大会012---Going to this culinary fair in Jersey.
真巧  钱德刚才说  要去那里开会012---How weird! Chandler just told us he's got a conference there.
真有意思012---Oh, that's funny
钱德应该  去康州或佛蒙特州开会012---Seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
我又不能决定在哪里开会012---I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
难道你希望大家认为我造假  我可没说谎012---Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
瑞秋在吗  我要找她012---Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
她出去逛街了012---No, she's out shopping.
可恶  怎么了012---Damn. What's going on?
我叫艾蜜莉来012---I told Emily to come.
所以我得赶快跟瑞秋说012---And I just need to, you know, talk to Rachel about it.
等等012---Wait a minute.
艾蜜莉来了之后  你真的就不见瑞秋了012---So when Emily comes, you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
我现在只能专心想着 "我可以见我老婆"012---Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right?
不去想我快胄溃疡的事012---And not the part that makes me do this.
所以你们  再也不能共处一室012---Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?
这怎么可能012---How is that even gonna work?
我也不知道012---I have no idea.
但我一定会想到办法012---But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
看起来实在不可能012---It doesn't seem like it's gonna work.
大家好  嗨012---Hi, guys. Hi.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
怎么了012---What's going on?
我们正要帮摩妮卡翻床垫012---We're flipping Monica's mattress.
我认为  应该先抬起来  再翻过来012---So I'm thinking, basically, we pick it up, and then we flip it.
这方法比我的主意好012---That's better than my way.
要不  你们顺便帮我翻好吗012---Oh, hey, guys, would you flip mine too?
受不了012---Oh, man.
我妈寄信来012---Oh, look! A letter from my mom.
瑞秋012---So, Rach?
你知道艾蜜莉要来012---You know how Emily's coming, right?
我知道啊012---Oh, yeah. I know.
听得到吗012---Can you hear anything?
当然  刚刚有人说  "听得到吗"012---Oh, yeah, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
乔伊的大屁股012---Hey, Joey's ass.
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
记得上次他们吵架分手时  我们卡在房里没东西可吃吗012---Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her all night with no food or anything?
罗斯在婚礼上说出瑞秋名字后  我猜旧戏可能会重演012---Well, when Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again.
所以我在这里藏了这些东西012---You know? So I hid this in here.
有糖果  猜谜012---Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
还有疯狂字谜   我要012---Ooh, Mad Libs. Mine!
保险套012---Condoms?
谁知道会在这里待多久012---Hey, you don't know how long we're gonna be in here.
搞不好我们还得负责  繁衍人类后代012---We may have to re-populate the Earth.
戴保险套还想繁衍后代012---And condoms are the way to do that?
有个关键问题012---Anyway, it all boils down to this.
上次我跟艾蜜莉通电话  天啊  我的狗死了012---The last time I talked to Emily... Aah! Oh, my God! Our dog died!
什么  天啊  拉普死了012---What? Oh, my God. LaPooh, our dog!
拉普还活着012---LaPooh's still alive?
我妈说他被冰淇淋车撞倒012---Oh! It says he was hit by an ice-cream truck
还被拖了19条街012---and dragged for 19 blocks!
我的天啊012---Oh! Oh, my God.
我们听到你在哭  别哭了012---Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
是拉普012---It's LaPooh!
我知道你觉得满肚子大便  过几天就没事了012---I know, it's LaPooh right now but it'll get better.
不可思议  我们到了012---I can't believe it! We're here!
枕头上还放巧克力  我最爱这套012---Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! Oh, I love that!
那你应该跟乔伊住  到处都有巧克力糖012---You should live with Joey. Roll-os everywhere.
我马上回来012---Oh. Okay, be right back.
万岁012---Oh, yes!
摩妮卡快来看  电视正在播警匪公路追逐战012---Monica, get in here. It's a high-speed car chase on!
我们要换房间012---We're switching rooms.
天啊  他们给了我们玻璃杯012---Oh, dear God, they gave us glasses!
杯子上有口红印012---They gave us glasses with lipstick on them.
如果连杯子都没换  谁知道还有哪些东西没换012---If they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.
亲爱的  我只是希望  过个完美的周末012---Oh, come on, sweetie. I just want this weekend to be perfect, okay?
换个房间  好嘛012---We can change rooms, can't we? Okay.
好吧  要换就快换  5号直升机刚跟丢了012---Okay, but let's do it now, though, because Chopper 5 just lost its feed!
嘿012---Hey, so, uh...
记得我上次有事想要告诉你吗012---You know how there was something I wanted to talk to you about?
对012---Oh, yeah.
嗯012---Well...
你知道我很希望跟艾蜜莉合好012---...you know I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
不过012---Well, there's this...
有件事012---...one thing.
好  我要说了012---Okay, here goes.
我答应她了012---I made a promise that
什么  你流鼻血012---Oh hey! What? Your nose is bleeding.
天啊  你流血了012---Oh, God! You're bleeding.
别又来了  我祖父去世时也一样012---No! Oh not again! This happened when my grandfather died.
实在是抱歉012---It's... Ugh, sorry.
好恶心012---Oh, gross, unh.
好了  对不起  你刚才要说什么012---Okay. So I'm sorry. What did you wanna tell me?
抱歉  抱歉012---Sorry. Sorry.
好012---Okay.
我不能再见你了012---I can't see you anymore.
我知道  真是的  我也看不见你012---Yeah, I know, it's ridiculous. I can't see you, either.
我想你们可能会喜欢这间房012---I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
太好了012---Okay, great.
听说他只剩下一半的汽油了012---They say he's only got half a tank left.
一半  那还可以跑很久012---Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
我们必须换房间  什么  为什么012---We're switching rooms again. What? Why?
这间房是花园景观  我们订的是海景房012---This is a garden-view room and we paid for an ocean-view room.
只剩一间海景房  可是你们不喜欢012---Our last ocean-view room was unacceptable to you.
不好意思   我可以跟你谈一下吗012---Excuse me. Um, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
钱德  来了012---Chandler. Yeah?
这些小人想占我们便宜  我才没那么蠢012---Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride. I won't let them.
我们可不是一对小孩012---We're not a couple of suckers.
说得好  大姐头012---I hear you, Mugsy.
这些房间都还好啊  请赶快选定  让我看012---But, look, all these rooms are fine.Okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch the...
让我跟你一起好好度假012---Have a perfect, magical weekend together with you?
我喜欢这间  没了012---Okay, this one I like. Nothing.
没了  结束了012---Nothing. It's over.
竟然没有延长时间012---Damn it, this is regularly scheduled programming!
可以关掉电视吗012---Can we turn the TV off, okay?
难道整个周末都要看电视012---Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
抱歉  我是不是  妨碍你换房间了012---I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room-switching fun?
你发火可别怪到我身上012---Ha, ha, don't blame me for ruining tonight.
否则该怪谁  那个拖着行李  跑过10间房的倒霉服务生012---Who should I blame? The nice bellman who had to drag our luggage to 10 rooms?
我不知道  或许该怪那个012---I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive...
以为用半箱汽油  就可以从纽约跑到加拿大的家伙012---...from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas?
不要说死者的坏话012---Do not speak ill of the dead.
我们出来就是为了过个浪漫的周末012---We're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together.
你到底哪里有毛病012---it-it, What's the matter with you?
我只是想看点电视  有何不对012---I just wanna watch a little television. What's the big deal?
放轻松嘛  老妈012---Jeez, relax, Mom.
你说什么012---What did you say?
我说 "放轻松  小摩"012---I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."
嗨012---Hey.
瑞秋  我一直有话要告诉你012---Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now
我非说不可012---and I really, I just have to get it out.
好  什么事012---Okay. All right. What's up?
好012---Okay.
你上次不是说我应该  不惜代价挽救婚姻吗012---You know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
对  我叫你  答应艾蜜莉所有要求012---Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
你的建议不错  不过我必须告诉你她要求012---And while that was good advice, you should know that what she wants...
什么012---Yeah?
就是叫我永远不能再见你012---...is for me not to see you anymore.
太离谱了  你根本做不到012---Well, that's crazy. You can't do that.
你怎么跟她解释012---What are you gonna tell her?
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你已经答应了  对不对012---Oh, you've already agreed to this, haven't you?
我知道自己很糟糕012---It's awful, I know. Uh, it's.
我心情也很糟糕  但这是挽救婚姻的唯一方法012---I mean, I feel terrible, but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
我很希望跟她合好  必须挽救这段婚姻012---And I do. I have to make this marriage work. I have to.
好在她来之前  我们还能继续见面012---But the good thing is, we can still see each other until she gets here.
我真幸运012---Oh, lucky me!
天啊  这真是好消息012---Oh, my God! That is good news, Ross!
自从拉普过世之后  最大的好消息012---I think that's the best news I've heard since LaPooh died!
你不知道我有多难过  我也很痛苦012---You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. Uh, this is so hard.
是吗  真的吗  罗斯012---Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?
我可以为你减轻压力012---Well, let me make this a little easier for you.
你做什么  愤而出走012---What are you doing? Storming out.
瑞秋  这是你家012---Rachel, this is your apartment.
你看我有多生气012---Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!
臭巧克力糖012---Damn Rolos!
你回来了  嘿012---Hey, you're back. Hey.
这次出差如何012---How was your conference?
糟透了  我跟同事吵架  到回来前都没合好012---It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues for the entire time.
怎么还有012---Are you kidding with this?
那么  你整个周末都泡汤了012---Uh, so your weekend was a total bust?
也不会  我看到  唐纳川普等电梯012---Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
嗨  你也回来了012---Hi. Hey, you're back too.
对  钱德  可以出来一下吗012---Yeah. Um, Chandler, could I talk to you outside for a second?
烹饪大会好玩吗  糟透了012---How was your chef thing? Ugh. It was awful.
有些人根本不会欣赏美食012---I guess some people don't appreciate really good food.
你的美食可能看起来很美味012---Maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first...
吃下去却害人上吐下泻012---...but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
钱德  摩妮卡012---Chandler. Monica.
旅馆费用多少  我要付我那一半012---Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
很好  三百元012---Okay, fine. $300.
三百元  就想成每间二十五元012---Three hundred dollars? Yeah. Just think of it as $25 per room.
你们鬼叫什么012---What are you guys woofing about?
钱德从我皮包偷了二十元纸钞012---Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!
不会吧012---No!
你看  我现在回头想想012---You know what? Now that I think about it...
难怪我老是没有二十元的   原来你倒有很多012---...I constantly find myself without 20s, and you always have lots.
你们应该看看她当时的表情012---You should've seen the look on her face.
我不希望瑞秋恨我  真不知道该怎么办012---I don't want Rachel to hate me. I don't know what to do.
你要听我的建议吗   请说012---You want my advice? Yes. Please.
你听了一定不高兴  没关系012---You're not gonna like it. That's okay.
你决定结婚太匆促了012---You got married too fast.
这算哪门子忠告  看吧012---That's not advice. I told you.
我去洗手间012---I'm going to the bathroom.
要是有人叫我别见你们其中一个  我绝对办不到012---Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I don't think I could do it.
我也不行012---Me neither.
或许我可以012---Maybe I could do it.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
我知道你们听说  罗斯跟我的事情了012---I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross.
我已经烦了一整天  请你们别再提起了012---But I've been obsessing about it all day and would love not to talk about it.All right?
我不知道这算不算提起012---Uh, I don't know if this falls under that category...
不过罗斯就在后面012---...but, uh, Ross is right back there.
那才不是罗斯  不是那个012---That's not Ross. Oh, no, not that guy.
虽然他很像012---He does look like him, though.
罗斯去洗手间了012---Okay. Ross is in the bathroom.
天啊  开始了  现在就这样012---Oh, my God. It's happening. It's already started.
我就像阿吉012---I'm Kip.
什么  你才不是阿吉012---What? Yeah, you're not Kip.
你知道阿吉是谁吗012---Do you even know who Kip is?
谁管他  你是瑞秋012---Who cares? You're Rachel.
阿吉是谁012---Who's Kip?
我以前的室友  以前也跟大家很好012---Kip, my old roommate. We all hung out together.
那个可怜人012---Oh, that poor bastard.
看吧  你们跟我说过那件事012---See? You told me the story.
他以前跟摩妮卡约会  分手后却无法共处一室012---He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together
你们都答应继续跟他做朋友  结果呢012---You all promised you'd stay his friend.And what happened?
还不是从此遭到排挤012---He got phased out.
我们才不会排挤你012---You're not gonna be phased out.
一定会  罗斯一定可以留下来  因为他是你哥哥012---Well, of course I am.It won't happen to Ross. He's your brother,
他又是你大学室友012---your old college roommate.
迟早有人会离开这个小圈子  我以前还以为走的是菲比012---It was a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
拜托  你住得远  又不是谁的亲戚012---Honey, come on, you live far away, you're not related.
很快就会被淡忘012---You lift right out.
嘿012---Hey.
宾先生012---Hey, Mr. Bing.
你住的饭店打电话来012---That, uh, hotel you stayed at called.
说在你房间捡到睫毛夹012---Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
是我的012---Yes, that was mine.
我以为你钓上哪个马子  她忘了带走012---I figured you hooked up with some girl and she left it there.
这种说法的确比较合理012---Yes, that would have made more sense.
我都快要不认识你了012---You know, I don't even feel like I know you anymore, man.
我只问你一次就好012---All right, uh, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time, all right?
无论你怎么说  我都相信你012---And whatever you say, I'll believe you.
你是不是去参加同性恋大会012---Were you or were you no on a gay cruise?
菲比012---Phoebe.
我不该说大家都会淡忘你012---I'm sorry about the whole lifting-out thing.
你得跟着我012---You gotta come with me.
去哪里  跟着我就对了012---Come where? Wherever I go.
你和我  我们可以重组一个团体  毕竟我跟你才是精华012---Come on, you and me, we'll start a new group. We're the best ones.
好吧  不过记得拉乔伊入伙012---Okay, but try to get Joey too.
菲比  我可以跟瑞秋私下谈谈吗012---Pheebs, do you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
当然可以012---Oh, sure, yeah.
再见  罗斯012---Bye, Ross.
永远不见了012---Forever.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你来干什么012---What are you doing here?
这不是违反规定吗012---Isn't this against the rules?
我跟摩妮卡谈过012---I talked to Monica.
是我做这个选择012---Look, I'm the one who made the choice.
我害的大家必须要改变012---I'm the one who's making things change.
所以离开的应该是我012---So I should be the one to, you know, step back.
罗斯  真的没关系012---Oh, Ross... No, no, it's okay. Really.
很多人只有在感恩节见到妹妹  同学会才见到大学室友012---Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving,and just see their college roommates at reunions
在 "汉堡王" 才见到乔伊012---...and just see Joey at Burger King.
这样你舒服一点了吗012---So is, is that better?
一点也没有012---No, it's not better.
我还是见不到你012---I still don't get to see you.
瑞秋  换做你会怎么办012---Well, what would you do, Rach? If you were me, what would you do?
嗯012---Well...
首先  我在婚礼上  不会说错名字012---...for starters, I would have said the right name at my wedding.
竟然会是这样012---I can't believe this is happening.
我知道012---I know.
我很抱歉012---I am so sorry.
我也知道012---I know that too.
瑞秋  抱歉打扰012---Ahem. Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt
菲比说你要告诉我  谈谈旅行什么的012---but, uh, Phoebe said you wanted to talk to me about a trip or something.
嘿012---Hey. Hi.
嗨012---Hi
我来012---I just came over to drop off...
没事012---...nothing.
上周末过得很糟吧012---So that weekend kind of sucked, huh?
对  没错012---Yeah, it did.
那大概我们完了012---So I guess this is over?
什么  我说你跟我啊012---What? Well, you know, you and me.
反正迟早得结束012---I mean, it had to end sometime.
为什么012---Why exactly?
因为上周末  我们吵架啊012---Because of the weekend. We had a fight.
钱德  别傻了012---Chandler, that's crazy.
如果你每次吵架就分手  交往大概不会超过...012---If you give up every time you have a fight with someone,you'd never be with anyone longer than...
所以012---So
我们还可以继续012---this isn't over?
你真可爱012---You are so cute!
当然  我们只是吵架012---No, no. It was a fight.
吵过之后就算了012---You deal with it and you move on.
根本没什么好害怕的012---It's nothing to freak out about.
真的吗  太好了012---Really? Okay, great.
欢迎加入成熟恋人行列012---Welcome to an adult relationship.
我们还算是恋爱男女朋友012---We're in a relationship?
恐怕是  好吧012---I'm afraid so. Okay.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
摩妮卡  听说你上周  看到唐纳川普012---Oh, hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
对  我看到他在等电梯012---Yeah, saw him waiting for an elevator.
瑞秋  借我睫毛夹  我的丢了012---Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler? I think I lost mine.
好啊  在厕所012---Yeah, it's in the bathroom.
乔伊  过来一下012---Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
没错012---Yes.
没错012---Yes.
你  跟你012---You? And you?
对  但是你不能告诉别人  还没有人知道012---Yes, but you cannot tell anyone. No one knows.
怎么会  何时的事012---But how? When?
要从伦敦说起  伦敦012---It happened in London. In London!
我们之所以没告诉大家  是不想你们大惊小怪012---The reason we didn't tell anyone was we didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.
这的确是大事012---But it is a big deal!
我非告诉谁不可012---I have to tell someone!
不行  你不能说012---No, no, no. You can't.
拜托你  我们就是  不想面对大家质问012---Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
求求你  保证不说012---Please, just promise you won't tell.
好吧012---All right.
不可思议012---Man, this is unbelievable!
这是件好事啊  可是012---I mean, it's great! But...
我知道  的确很棒012---I know. It's great!
我可不想看到这个012---Oh, I don't wanna see that!
我们真是太蠢了012---We're so stupid.
你知道他们在做什么吗012---Do you know what's going on in there?
他们想抢走乔伊012---They're trying to take Joey.
网球界最有名的菲比  就叫做杀球菲比012---"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. Heh.
赢了就得跟对方击掌  说 "嗨  菲比"012---If you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!"'
真有意思  很好玩012---Oh, that's cute. We really all enjoyed it.
但是这不算  不算什么012---But you know it doesn't count. Count for what?
这可不算疯狂字谜012---Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs.
我不想玩了  不好玩了012---I guess fun time's over. Yeah, I'm done.
等等  要遵守规则才有意思  也才有意义啊012---Wait, guys, if we follow the rules,it's still fun and it means something.
我要闪人了012---I'm gonna take off.
有规则才好  不守规则怎么会好玩012---Guys, rules are good!Rules help control the fun.
嘿  嘿  嘿  嘿012---Hey, hey, hey, hey.
不准这样  还在我屋里  就得守规矩012---None of that. Not while you're living under my roof.
什么012---What?
就算我知道内幕  也不代表我喜欢看你们亲热012---Look, just because I know about you two doesn't mean I like looking at it.
你试镜不是还有一小时才结束吗012---Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
很抱歉  我可不是中年黑人妇女012---Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman.
而且还走错试镜场地012---And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.
你们要我假装不知道  就得假装你们没怎样012---Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two,then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
好  抱歉012---Okay, sorry.
我听到了012---I can hear that.
瑞秋还在上班012---Rachel's at work.
我还是听得到012---I can still hear you.
老友记  第五季  第06集  雪男012---Friends  S05E06   The One With The Yeti
嗨  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
那是什么012---Hey. What's that?
我妈寄给我外婆的祖传宝物012---Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother.
你们相信吗012---Can you believe it?
一年前我连家人都没有  现在竟然有祖传家产012---A year ago I didn't even have a family,and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
天啊012---Oh, God!
好软012---Oh, soft.
这是貂皮吗012---Is this mink?
对  我妈为何寄皮草给我012---Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur?
她完全不了解我吗012---Doesn't she know me but at all?
我已经有外套了  而且还没牺牲任何可怜动物012---Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.
只不过是时薪12分钱的九岁菲律宾童工012---Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody...
卖命做的012---...for 12 cents an hour.
别听我的  我胡说的012---That didn't happen, I made that up.
嘿  罗斯012---Hey. Ross?
罗斯  你不能在这里贴广告012---Ross, you can't put up flyers in here.
为什么  别人都可以012---How come? Everybody else does.
就是你不行012---You can't.
什么东西012---What is that?
我要处理掉一些家具012---Oh, uh, I'm getting rid of a couple of things.
这是你所有家当012---This is all of your things.
没错012---Yes, yes, it is.
没关系  艾蜜莉说  我们应该买新家具012---No, but it's good. Emily thinks we should get all new stuff.
光属于我们俩的家具  也都是全新的东西012---Stuff that's just ours. Together, you know, brand new.
基本上这是 "瑞秋碰过的家具" 大拍卖012---So basically this is a "getting rid of anything Rachel ever touched" sale.
摸过  用过  坐过  睡过的都不行012---Touched, used, sat on, slept on...
我全买了012---I'll take it all.
罗斯  你不反对012---Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
只要顺着艾蜜莉  她来纽约就没事了012---Look, if I can just do what Emily wants,and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
但是  这种做法也太极端了吧012---Okay, but don't you think that's a little extreme?
毕竟是我说错名字  你能怪她吗012---After what I did, can you blame her?
你已经算轻松了012---Oh, my God. You got off easy.
我朋友席薇的老公在床上喊错名字  她就把他的小弟弟变绿了012---When my friend Sylvie's husband said someone else's name in bed,she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
他这是做什么012---What is he doing?
艾蜜莉觉得罗斯的家具  会沾上瑞秋的虱子吗012---Emily thinks Ross' furniture has got Rachel cooties?
乔伊  别激动  不012---Calm down, Joey. No.
我偏要  事情搞得乱七八糟012---Everything's getting all messed up, you know?
艾蜜莉不准罗斯见瑞秋012---Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.
可是我们会继续见瑞秋  因此罗斯再也不能见我们012---We're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence, Ross stops seeing us.
我也不开心  一切都变了012---Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
我知道  我们不能再见罗斯  乔伊还会用 "因此"012---Yeah, I know. We're losing Ross, Joey said "hence."
我也不高兴012---I'm not happy about this either,
但是  如果罗斯能开心012---but, you know, if Ross says he's happy...
我们不该说出  自己对艾蜜莉的心情012---...then we just have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves.
大家愿意吗012---Are you cool with that?
不要012---No.
不过我是演员012---But, you know, I'm an actor.
我可以装得无所谓012---I'll act cool.
天啊  我怕死储藏室了012---Ooh. Oh, God, storage rooms give me the creeps.
摩妮卡  拜托  你快点012---Monica, please, hurry up, honey, please.
瑞秋  你要吃小圆松饼  就得让我先找到煎盘012---Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
我想吃小圆松饼  好吧012---I want the little round waffles. All right.
找到了012---Here it is.
就在杀虫药下面012---Right underneath the can of bug bomb.
锅碗瓢盆怎么可以  放在毒药下面012---I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
好吧  我吃土司好了012---Okay, you know what? I'll have toast.
天啊  喷他喷他012---Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
我不知道该如何处置这件皮草012---I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
可以给我012---I'll take it.
好主意  太好了012---That might work. Oh, yeah
真好  怎样  你们觉得如何012---Huh? All right, what do you think?
五分钟后换你上台  明妮莉小姐012---You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.
不  只是有点突然012---No, no, no, it's just a bit sudden.
其实我很高兴  也全力赞成012---No, it's great, okay? I am totally on board.
我也爱你  好  再见012---I love you too. All right, bye.
怎么了  罗斯012---What's the matter, Ross?
没事  其实是件好消息012---Nothing. Oh, actually, great news!
我刚跟艾蜜莉通过电话  看来我要搬家了012---Um, just got off the phone with Emily,and looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.
为什么  她认为  而且我也同意012---Why? Well, her thought is... And I agree.
既然要换新家具  干脆也换间公寓012---Fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?
她表妹有个地方要分租012---Her cousin has this great place to sublet.
一边可以看到河  一边可以看到哥伦比亚012---It's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
那是离市区很远的地方  大概要转搭三种车012---That's way uptown. That's like three trains away...
太棒了012---...which is great.
我喜欢搭火车012---I love to ride that rail.
你真的同意012---So you're really okay with this?
当然  离上班地点是有点远012---Yes, yes. I mean, it's kind of far from work...
但是我通勤时就有很多时间012---...but, uh, you know, I'll get so much done on the commute.
她算是送了我一份大礼  那就是时间012---I've been given the gift of time.
真有意思  上次圣诞节  我还得到很多空间呢012---That's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.
两样加起来就是有个小宇宙了012---We should get them together and make a continuum.
现在还要搬家012---Now he's moving?
艾蜜莉到底施了什么法啊012---Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!
他又不在这里012---He's not even here.
大家听我们说012---You guys. You guys.
我们刚刚去储藏室  看到一个很可怕的人012---We were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man.
目露凶光  全身毛茸茸012---He was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast-man.
就像大脚哈利或是喜马拉雅雪人012---He was like a Bigfoot or a yeti or something.
而且他还拿着斧头  瑞秋只好拿杀虫药喷他012---He came at us with an ax, so Rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.
我拉开拉环拼命喷他012---Yeah, I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.
深色头发  满脸胡须  对012---Uh, like, dark hair, bushy beard? Yeah.
你们喷的是丹尼012---Yeah, you fogged Danny.
拜托  才不是丹尼012---Ugh, please. We did not fog Danny.
丹尼是谁012---Who's Danny?
丹尼刚搬到楼下012---Danny just moved in downstairs.
那家伙去安地斯山四个月  才刚回国  人很好012---He just got back from this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
什么人很好  每次我们喷谁  你就帮他说话012---Oh, he's nice. He's nice. You know, you always stick up for the people we fog.
什么事  嗨012---Yeah? Hi.
你大概不记得  我们就是上次喷你的人012---You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
我们很抱歉  乱喷一通012---We're really sorry we fogged you.
随便012---Okay.
嗨  我们只是要告诉你  我们不是故意的012---Hi, uh, just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.
我们以为你是雪人还是怪物什么的012---We actually thought you were like a yeti or something.
随便012---Okay.
怎样012---Yes?
嗨  抱歉打扰你012---Hi. Ahem, sorry to bother you...
你接受我们道歉的态度  让我们很不爽012---...but I don't think that we can accept your acceptance of our apology.
听起来一点也不真心012---It just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
对012---Yeah
随便012---Okay.
那家伙真恶劣012---Wow. That guy is so rude.
没错  他哪里有病012---Really. What is with that guy?
换做我喷你  你早就原谅我了012---I mean, you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
其实  你有喷到我  一点点012---Well, you did, a little bit.
天啊  我很抱歉012---Oh, my God, honey. I'm so sorry.
我完全不介意012---I totally forgive you.
真的012---Really?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你知道  我那个开火葬场的朋友克里斯吧012---So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
火葬场那个克里斯  当然012---Crematorium Chris? Sure.
他说他愿意免费帮我烧皮草012---Well, he said that he would cremate my fur coat for free...
只要我介绍死人去他那里火化012---...if I, um, you know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
天啊  好漂亮的皮草012---Oh, my God.Oh, my God. Look at these pelts.
别太喜欢了  她要烧掉了012---Don't get too attached. She's having it cremated.
什么012---What...?
亲爱的菲比012---Phoebe? Ha. Honey?
我知道你是个怪胎  大家平时也欣赏你这点012---Honey, I know you're quirky, and I get a big kick out of it. We all do, actually.
但是你毁掉这么棒的皮草  实在是不合天理012---But if you destroy a coat like this,I mean, that is like a crime against nature.
说错了  是有违时尚流行012---Not nature. Fashion.
这叫做流行012---This is fashion?
尸体叫做流行012---Okay, so to you, death is fashion?
实在有意思012---That's really funny.
接下来菲比为各位展示  最新的毛茸茸尸体012---Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass
这些动物死于寒冷的俄罗斯012---...from, you know, the steel traps of wintry Russia.
你们真认为好看012---I mean, you really think this looks good?
因为我觉得不赖012---Because I do.
我也想念你  希望快点见到你012---I know, I miss you too. I can't wait to see you.
我爱你  再见012---I love you. Bye.
这什么  石头吗012---Okay, what is in here, rocks?
不  我收集的化石样本012---No, this is my collection of, uh, fossil samples.
就是石头嘛012---So rocks.
我一定会想念这里012---I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Heh.
小班就在那边学会走路的012---You know, Ben took his first steps right over there.
记不记得我上次撞到这里  后来还昏倒了012---Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kind of knocked me out a little?
我很喜欢这间公寓012---I love this place.
老实说  我真希望别搬家012---To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
你的意思是你也不想走012---Uh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
如果艾蜜莉给我选择的机会  你本来就有机会012---Well, I mean, if, uh, Emily gave me a choice. You do have a choice.
罗斯  你为什么要听她的  你疯了吗012---Ross, why are you listening to her? Are you crazy?
为什么012---What?
艾蜜莉这些要求太过分012---It's not right what Emily wants you to do
她根本就是012---She is totally
不要再捏我了012---Stop pinching me.
你们都说只要罗斯快乐  我就不该大嘴巴012---You guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right?
可是  他刚说他也不开心012---Well, he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
这是怎么回事012---What's going on?
我们都讨厌艾蜜莉012---We all hate Emily.
才怪  不  罗斯  我们不讨厌艾蜜莉012---No. No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.
我们只是认为你为了讨她开心  牺牲太多012---We just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
对012---Yeah.
大家都认为她有点不可理喻012---We just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
对  就是不可理喻012---Yes, yes, unreasonable.
不可理喻012---Unreasonable?
要是以后你们谁结婚  大伙也有这种反应呢012---How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married?
你们根本不知道如何维持婚姻012---You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.
婚姻就是互相妥协  永远都会开心吗  不会012---It's about compromise. Do you always like it? No.
但是你愿意吗   愿意012---Do you do it? Yes.
因为婚姻不是只有欢乐  只有梦幻  只管上咖啡馆012---Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky,drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time
婚姻是真实生活012---It's real life, okay?
婚姻只适合成年人012---It's what grownups do.
他说得有道理012---I think he's right.
你们太常泡咖啡馆了012---You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
我对罗斯很抱歉012---God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
我知道012---I know.
我觉得似乎都怪我012---I kind of feel like it's my fault.
似乎012---Kind of?
要不是你大嘴巴  也不会有这种下场012---If you just kept this to yourself, none of this would have happened.
我最近知道的秘密太多  总有说溜嘴的时候012---Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days,something was bound to slip out.
其实你很勇敢012---Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
我坐不住了  我得去走走012---I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
菲比  你怎么还穿那件外套   你不是关心动物吗012---Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
我最近读了一些书  告诉你们012---Well, ahem, I've been reading up, and for your information...
貂不是好动物012---...minks are not very nice.
好  我承认  我喜欢这件外套012---Okay, I admit it. I love this coat, okay?
这是裹在我身上最棒的东西  菲尔亨利都不够好012---It's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley.
你还记得菲尔吗   他帅呆了012---Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.
嗨012---Hi.
原来你比较喜欢短发012---So you like the short hair better?
什么012---What?
雪人  你是丹尼012---Yeti? Uh, Danny?
我得剪头发  因为杀虫剂的味道太浓012---I had to cut my hair to get rid of the,fogger smell.
抱歉  我绝对不会再乱喷了012---Listen, I'm so sorry. I would have never fogged you...
要不是你的样子实在太像012---...you know, if you hadn't looked so... You know, um...
当然012---Absolutely.
有些人只会以貌取人012---Some people are just into appearances.
什么   没关系  无所谓012---What? That's cool. That's cool.
什么  等等  什么无所谓  你根本不认识我012---What...? Hey, whoa, no, no, no, that is not cool.You don't even know me.
你提着一堆购物袋  还拿着百货公司目录012---Come on. You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalogue.
你以为这样就能看透我012---So from that, you think you've got me all figured out?
不可能012---Well, you don't.
搞不好我的袋子里装满  要给贫困儿童的玩具012---You know, I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.
是吗012---Do you?
如果他们喜欢拿紧身裤当玩具012---Well, you know, if kids like to play with capri pants.
随便012---Okay.
不准你再说这个字   讨厌你老这么说012---And stop saying that. I hate that.
随便012---Okay.
好  我不该光看你外表012---Fine! I judged you.
当时我只能靠第一印象  可是你也一样012---I made a snap judgement. But you did it too!
而且你更糟糕012---and you're worse...
因为你只相信第一印象012---...because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgment.
甚至不肯反省自己对不对  你有什么资格说别人012---You can't even open up your mind for a second to see that you might be wrong.What does that say about you?
对面那家披萨店好吃吗012---That pizza place across the street any good?
什么  我饿了  要不要去吃彼萨012---What? I'm hungry. You wanna get some pizza?
你还想骂人也可以继续吼012---You can keep yelling if there's more.
随便012---Okay.
随便  不准你再说这个字  讨厌你老这么说012---Okay. Stop saying that. I hate that.
罗斯012---Uh, Ross?
你还在生我们的气吗  对012---Are you still mad at us? Yup.
很好  因为我们写了一首 "很抱歉" 的歌012---Oh, good, because we have an "I'm Sorry" song. Ha, ha.
告诉你们  我现在心情不好012---You know what? I'm really not in the mood.
罗斯  我很难过012---Look, Ross.I feel really bad.
你生活发生巨大改变  而我却在乱讲话012---I mean, you're going through all this stuff,and I just acted like a jerk.
对  我们都很对不起012---Yeah, we are so sorry.
你们说出歌词了012---You're stepping on the song.
我们实在太离谱了  其实  我们都站在你这边012---Look, we were way out of line, all right? We totally support you.
无论你做出什么决定  我们都赞成012---Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
歌词都被你们说完了  我还唱什么012---Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song.
搬家已经够难过了012---Look, this is hard enough, okay?
现在  真的很需要你们012---I really need you guys right now.
没错  所以我们才要012---Yes, exactly. And that's why...
你今晚过来  我帮你煮几道你爱吃的菜012---Why don't you come over tonight, and I'll make you your favorite dinner? Come on.
好012---Okay.
谢谢你们012---Thanks, you guys.
菲比  你身上这件是貂皮吗012---Pheebs, are you wearing fur?
别再大惊小怪了  这又不是用导盲犬的皮做的012---Okay, let's get some perspective, people.It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat.
罗斯  我知道  我为什么突然爆发了012---You know, Ross, I, uh, think I kind of understand why I lost it today.
是吗012---You do, huh?
你知道我是个演员012---Yeah, you see, um...I'm an actor, right?
所以我的情绪比较丰富  你了解吗012---So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface, you know?
我要同时面临多种情绪  你懂吗012---I got a lot of balls in the air, you know what I mean?
我这种人的生活实在不容易  必须到处流浪   孤孤单单012---It's tough. Guys like me, you know, you wander around, you're alone.
你胡说什么啊012---What are you talking about?
我也不晓得012---I'm not sure.
嗨  回来了  你刚上哪去了012---Hi. Hey, look at you. Where have you been?
我去吃彼萨   跟丹尼去012---Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
怎么可能012---How did that happen?
那个雪人口才真好012---That yeti is one smooth talker.
希望你还吃得下  因为晚餐快好了012---I hope you're not too full, because dinner's almost ready.
我回房间去就好了012---Yeah, you know, I think I'm probably just gonna hang out in my room.
不  为什么012---Oh, no. Why?
拜托你们012---Come on, you guys.
要是艾蜜莉知道  我跟你们一起吃饭012---Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner with you,
她一定会抓狂  你们也很清楚012---she would flip out, and you know it.
没关系  我无所谓012---It's okay. I really... I don't mind.
等等  请你留下来012---Wait, wait, wait. You know what? Just stay.
拜托012---Please.
我希望你留下来012---It would really mean a lot for me if you stay.
罗斯  拜托你  跟我们一起吃饭012---Ross, I just...Rachel, please, just have dinner with us.
好好好  乔伊  别激动  对不起  抱歉012---Okay, Joey, it's okay. Settle down.All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
瑞秋  因为我是演员012---You see, Rach, I'm an actor.
看  那个光屁股的丑八怪  又出现了012---Hey. Hey, look. Ugly naked guy's back.
我好久没看到他了012---We haven't seen him in so long.
天啊  我真想念这个死胖子012---Oh, God. I really missed that fat bastard.
这可真诡异012---Wow. This is so weird.
我刚想到这可能是  大家最后一次一起鬼混012---I just realized this may be the last time we're all hanging out together.
他似乎也知道012---It's almost as if he knew.
我来接012---I'll get it.
喂012---Hello?
嗨  艾蜜莉012---Hi, Emily.
他在这里  你等等012---Yeah, uh, you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
嘿012---Hey.
对  我们正在吃饭012---Yeah, yeah, we're, uh, just having dinner.
好  你等等  她跟大家打招呼012---Uh, yeah, sure, hold on.She wants to say hi.
你等等012---Hold on.
嗨  艾蜜莉012---Hi, Emily.
嗨  大家好012---Hello, everyone.
你们有谁在啊012---So who am I saying hello to?
我不知道这里有谁  不过瑞秋肯定不在012---Well, uh, I don't know about who's here,but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here, and that's Rachel.
最好是这样012---Well, I should hope not.
罗斯应该很清楚了012---Ross knows better than that by now.
其实瑞秋也在012---You know what? Uh, Rachel is here.
她也在012---She's there?
对  她在那边012---Oh, yeah, there she is.
她在这里012---Yeah. Yeah, she's here.
罗斯  切掉扩音012---Ross, take me off speakerphone.
嗨  你怎么可以这样012---Hi. How could you do this to me?
我以为我已经把瑞秋的事  说得够清楚了012---I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear.
艾蜜莉  我只是跟朋友吃饭012---Look, Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
你就是喜欢跟她黏在一起012---You obviously can't keep away from her.
你太夸张了012---That's ridiculous.
我愿意为你搬家012---Look, I'm moving for you.
愿意为你不见朋友012---I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.
求求你  快搭飞机来纽约012---Please, just get on the plane and come to New York, okay?
你就知道我只想跟你在一起012---You'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
如果我在那边  就不会这么紧张了012---I'll feel better when I'm there
也可以随时知道你在哪里012---and I can know where you are all the time.
你不可能永远掌握我的行踪012---Well, you can't know where I am all the time.
如果你不信任我  这个婚姻永远有问题012---Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
你说得对012---You're right.
你能相信我吗012---So... can you trust me?
不能012---No.
好像很顺利012---I think it's going okay.
他好像在微笑012---Looks like he's smiling.
你怎么知道  你只看得到他的背影012---How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head.
当然看得出来012---You can totally tell.
你们看012---Here, look, watch me.
微笑  皱眉  微笑  皱眉012---Smile. Frown. Smile. Frown.
微笑012---Smile.
大概玩完了012---Well, I guess that's it.
怎么了  怎么回事012---Why? What happened?
我的婚姻完了  什么012---My marriage is over.What?
亲爱的012---Oh, sweetie.
看看你  全身发枓012---Oh, look at you, you're shivering.
给你012---Here.
罗斯  需要我们做什么吗012---Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
可以的话  帮我跟阿甘要回家具012---Yeah.You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
别再折磨我了012---Okay, stop tormenting me.
这是貂   貂很坏012---This is mink, okay? They're mean,
而且貂讨厌松鼠012---and they hate squirrels.
很多貂都想被做成貂皮012---And, you know, most of these probably wanted to be coats.
好好好  我知道了012---All right, fine. No, I get it.
拿去012---Here.
给你012---You take it.
高兴了吧  我快冷死了012---Are you happy now? I'm cold.
你在看原住民裸女吗012---Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?
不是  你看012---No, look.
那是猪啊012---That's a pig.
我知道  你看牠的咪咪多大012---I know, I know, But look at the knobs on it!
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
艾蜜莉的表妹  竟然把我赶出来012---Emily's cousin kicked me out.
什么  为什么012---What? Why?
当你跟老婆的表妹分租公寓012---when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin
要是之后又离婚012---and then you get a divorce
表妹就会突然把房子要回去012---sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
怎么可以这样  你们没签约吗012---How can he do that?Didn't you sign a lease?
谁跟亲戚租公寓还签约012---Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
嘿  你可以跟我们住012---Hey, You can stay with us.
我们照顾你  没错012---We'll take care of ya! Oh, yeah! Absolutely!
包在我们身上012---Anything you need man!
你心情好一点就说一声012---But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better
好让我们取笑你的鸡窝头012---so that we can make fun of your hair!
没问题  好012---You got it. Okay.
谢谢你们  我太感激了012---Thanks, I really appreciate this.
我得回去打包行李了012---All right,I'm going to get packing again.Man
我最近不断搬家  简直像是游民012---I've been moving around so much that I feel like a nomad.
怎么了  他以为你说的是 "咪咪"012---What? He thought you said gonad.
老友记  第五季  第07集  罗斯入伙012---Friends  S05E07  The One Where Ross Moves In
哇  摩妮卡  要是每家餐厅  都跟你的一样干净012---Wow, Monica. if every restaurant is as clean as yours,
我就没饭吃了012---I'd have a tough time making a living.
别说了  赖瑞012---Ha, oh, Larry!
卫生稽查员收佣金吗012---Um, do health inspectors work on commission?
不  不过收红包012---No, bribes.
我可以笑吧012---Ha-ha-ha, it's okay to laugh?
当然  我开玩笑的啦012---I was just kidding.
我去检查厨房地板012---I'll check the kitchen floor.
请自便  赖瑞012---Knock yourself out.
真可口012---Yummy! Heh.
你说赖瑞   我也愿意让他检查我厨房地板012---Larry? Yeah, I'd let him check out my kitchen floor.
98分012---A 98.
你没戴帽子  所以扣两分012---I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat,
因为违反第五条规定012---That is a Section 5 violation.
听着  赖瑞  亲爱的012---Oh. Now look, Larry, honey, ha, ha.
我写过第五条条文的书012---Um, I wrote the book on Section 5.
在厨房才要戴帽子012---I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
那你的帽子呢  在厨房  我进去拿012---Where's your hat? In the kitchen. I'll get it.
就这里扣两分012---Ah, there's the two points!
你真该读读你自己写的书012---You should really read that book you wrote.
哇  你看到帽子在厨房012---You saw the hat in the kitchen
知道她进去拿时没戴帽子012---and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.
你可以主演  卫生稽查员兼侦探的电视剧了012---You could have your own health inspector detective show.
你太客气了012---Ah, I don't know about that.
而我可以演你的助手薇达012---But then I could be your sidekick, Voonda, heh.
或许薇达可以留电话给我  我就能约她出去吃饭012---Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
好  她一定会很高兴012---She would love that...Y'know
因为你知道哪家餐厅才卫生012---...since you know all the clean places to eat, heh.
我再打给你012---I'll call you.
他真幽默012---He's so funny! Whoa, oh.
谢了 谢谢012---Thank you. Thanks.
摩妮卡  罗斯还好吧  还在为艾蜜莉伤心吗012---How's Ross doing since all the Emily stuff?
心情不太好012---He's not great. .
不过还撑得下去012---But, um, he's dealing with it
等等  你该不会  拜托  不可能012---Oh. Wait, you're not...
我不可能再跟罗斯交往012---Oh, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again
他还要失魂落魄很久的时间012---I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time.
况且你也知道  我不喜欢追离婚的男人012---Besides, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
对  快结婚的人你才要012---Right, you only go for them five minutes before they get married.
我要两磅爪哇摩卡咖啡012---Two pounds of mocha java.
是丹尼  你们还会出去吗012---It's Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
不知道012---I don't know.
上次出去一次之后  他就没再打给我012---He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.
我们只在走廊上打情骂俏012---I see him in the hallway. We flirt.
我笑得下巴掉下来  结果却没下文012---I'm all...and then nothing.
嘿  嗨  丹尼012---Hey. Hi, Danny.
你很渴吧012---Wow, thirsty, huh?
我周六要办派对  庆祝我搬新家012---ctually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
真有意思  真好012---Oh, fun. Oh, great!
我非常期待  是啊012---I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah.
那我走了012---Okay, See you!
看来他新家不欢迎我们012---Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
很好  我知道他在玩什么把戏012---Okay. All right, I see what he's doing!
他故意不约我  因为他要我主动约他012---He's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out.
可是你不鸟他  没错012---And you won't do that. That's right!
否则主导权就落在他手里012---Cause that would give him the control.
他现在故意说什么要办派对012---So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know.
要我暗示他约我012---trying to get me to hint around for an invitation.
可是我当场给他好看  对吧012---Blew up in his face, didn't it? Ha.
所以他根本没有要办派对012---So there is no party?
有  当然有  当然有012---No, there's a party. There's a party.
不过谁是老大还不知道呢012---But the power?that is still up for grabs.
你听得懂吗012---You follow me?
应该吧012---I think so.
你是说他故意不约你  是因为他喜欢你012---So he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you?
就是这样012---Exactly!
罗斯012---Ross?
嘿  室友们012---Hey, roomies!
你把家里布置得真温馨012---I love what you've done with the place.
我知道箱子堆得到处都是012---Oh, I know it's a lot of boxes.
我要再次感谢你们收容我  没问题012---but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.Not a problem.
既然你要在这里住一阵子012---And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, .
干脆录段你的留言012---why don't―I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
是啊  喔  希望你们别介意012---Oh, I, uh, hope you don't mind...
我已经录了一段012---...but I kind of already jazzed it up a little, ha, ha.
你们听012---Check it out.

真是闪闪发亮012---Shiny, ha, ha.
我可以去洗个手吗  因为我下班就直接过来了012---Oh, you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work .
谁晓得这两个宝贝碰过什么呢012---and who knows where these babies have been
你真是耍宝的要命啊  哈啊012---You are just nonstop, ha-ha-ha!
我们必须立刻离开这里  为什么012---We're out of here. Why?
我刚经过厨房就看到了有十项违规了012---Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations!
我要勒令他们停业012---I'm shutting this place down!
你有权限可以这样做吗012---You have the power to do that?.
有这个就可以012---This does
那就让他们停业吧012---Shut it down.
嘿012---Hey.

没什么012---Nothing.
你造了一座城堡   对吧012---You built a fort, didn't you?
差不多012---Kind of, heh.
天啊  空气清净器  是罗斯的空气清净器012---Oh, my God! The air purifier. Ross' air purifier.
我大学四年只听得到…012---All I heard for four years through college was...
老兄  你应该偶尔出去走走012---You should have gone out once in a while.
我讨厌这东西012---I hate this thing!
钱德  罗斯是我们的好友012---Come on, Chandler. Ross is our friend.
他现在需要我们帮忙012---He needs us right now.

不过我可能有事012---Uh, Actually, I think, ahem, I'm going to be busy.

我这招打得他满脸豆花012---Walked right into that one didn't he?
哪一招012---What one?
你希望他邀你参加派对  他也来啦012---You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
可是  他是等到最后一刻才来012---He waited until the last minute.
如果我答应  他就知道  我没事可做  等着去那白痴派对012---So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
我说不去  所以还是我占上风012---I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
正点  所以换他出招了012---Great. So the ball is in his court?
出招  不  他没招可出了012---Ball? No, there's no ball.

不是  叫我闭嘴的手势012---No, the quiet down thing.
你是说  这样啊012---Oh. You mean this.
我不知道我还能憋多久012---I don't know how much more I can take.
你知道他竟然拿我的海滩游侠录影带  去录什么怪小虫吗012---Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?
天啊  要是里面录的是A片呢012---My God! What if that had been porn? Oh!
好  听着  这样也许不好过012---All right look, y'know, this may be tough...
但是  是罗斯  我和他一起度过大学生活的012---come on...but it's Ross. I survived college with him.

菲比  这家伙不断关掉大家喜欢去的餐馆012---Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places,
以后我们上哪吃饭012---where will we eat?
不晓得  干净的地方吧012---I don't know. Clean places?

不知道  就套房来说有点贵012---Ooh, I don't know. It's kind of expensive for a studio.

房东真是太聪明了012---Somebody was using his head.
再看看其他地方012---Let's check out the rest of the place.
我想就这么大了012---I think this is it.
不知道  我们应该看看其它公寓012---I don't know. Maybe we should keep looking.
可是罗斯  这地方马上就能搬进来012---But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
对啊  你不会愿意  继续跟我们住五周012---Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for five weeks.
你觉得我应该租下012---So you think I should go ahead take this place?
这里很棒啊012---Oh, it's perfect!
你呢012---How about you?
这里有厨房兼浴室012---Kitchen, slash, bathroom.
好吧  我懂了012---Ah, I see what you guys are saying.
我下楼去填申请表了012---I'll, uh, go downstairs and fill out an application.

他当然知道012---He knew!
我们厨房能不能装浴缸012---Could we get a bathtub in our kitchen?
要去吃饭了吗012---Hey, ready for dinner?
当然  好012---Ooh, absolutely. Great.
你上次不是说要去布里克街  那家意大利餐厅012---You wanted to go to the Italian place on Bleecker St?
我爱死那里了012---Oh, I love that place, ha, ha.
所以  不行012---So no. Oh.

我今天买的  我突然想喝牛奶012---I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
我们走吧012---Okay, let's go.
嘿  老兄012---Hey, buddy.
你知道卫生规则  11条B款吗  垃圾应该从后门拿出去012---Health Code 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
可是这样就得从干洗店绕路012---But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
你宁可方便也不顾卫生012---Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
够了  赖瑞012---Okay, stop! Larry,
你能不能当赖瑞就好  而不是卫生稽查员赖瑞012---okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
开始还很刺激012---Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first
但是现在简直是  哪家餐厅也去不了012---But now, it's like, okay, so where are we going to eat ever?
我想  我可以口头警告012---Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
谢谢012---Thank you.
快走啊012---Go, go!
要是吃饱饭后  你还想抓人012---Now, If, after dinner, you still need to bust someone...
我知道哪个热狗摊老板  喜欢挖鼻子012---...I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
搞不好我们做的是好事  帮助罗斯早点恢复正常012---Maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet.
对  而且那地方实在不错   是啊012---Yes, That was a nice place.Yeah!
虽然柜子不多  不过可以用袋子装好挂在窗外012---No closet space, but he could hang his stuff out the window in a bag.

不知道012---I don't know.
要吃披萨吗012---Maybe pizza?
我说的是罗斯012---About Ross! Oh.

不过他养了一只大狗012---Of course, he has a big, huge dog
那只狗半夜叫个不停012---that, uh, barks into the night.
谁不喜欢狗012---Well, who doesn't love dogs?

不行  我得从楼下走上来  假装我刚从外面回来012---I have to go downstairs and come back up, as if I'm coming home from the gala.
你去引开他的注意力  但是别勾引他012---So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.

与其说它是内裤  不如说是一种伟大工程012---It's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering.
料子那么少  效果却那么大012---It's amazing how much they can do with so little material.
它还会戏弄你  有穿吗  没穿吗012---And the way they play with your mind. I mean, is it there? Is it not there?
你知道你还在碎碎念吗012---Are you aware that you're still talking?
有没有人要感谢  丁字裤以外的东西012---Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
我不知道要比较感谢离婚呢  还是感谢被赶出来012---I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce, or my eviction?

抱歉  这是最惨的一次感恩节012---I'm sorry. It's just this is the worst Thanksgiving ever.
不  不行  我才是悲惨感恩节盟主012---No, no, no. I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.
你不能挟失败的婚姻空降  抢了我的宝座012---You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage...and take that away from me.
你又要说你爸妈离婚的事了012---You're not gonna tell the whole story  about how your parents got divorced, are you?
别这样嘛  我想听012---Come on. I want to hear it.
没有钱德扫兴  就不算感恩节了012---It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out.
这跟游行一样  是一项传统012---It's a tradition, like the parade.
如果游行也出柜离家  抛妻弃子的话012---If the parade decided it was gay, moved out and abandoned its entire family.
钱德  亲爱的012---Now, Chandler, dear.
爸爸和我要离婚012---Just because your father and I are getting a divorce...
并不代表我们不爱你012---...doesn't mean we don't love you.
只是代表他上床的对像是男仆  而不是我012---It just means he would rather sleep with the houseboy than with me.
小少爷还要火鸡吗012---More turkey, Mr. Chandler?
你说得对  你的更惨  你是悲惨感恩节盟主012---You're right, yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
不一定  我有一次更惨012---I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
惨过 "小少爷还要火鸡" 吗012---Really? Worse than:"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"
小少爷跟仆人有仇吗  对  我的更惨012---Did the little rich boy had a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse.

记得前世的事一定很酷吧012---Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that.
我都没有前世的记忆了012---I don't have any past life memories.
当然没有  你是新生命012---Of course, you don't, sweetie. You're brand-new.
我知道摩妮卡最惨的感恩节012---I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
那个就别提了  说嘛012---Oh, let's not tell this story. Oh, come on.
我知道  我知道012---Oh, no! I know! I know!
就是摩妮卡的火鸡  卡在乔伊头上那次012---It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head.

菲比012---Phoebe?
乔伊  怎么了012---Joey? What's going on?
我的天哪  我知道  它卡住了012---Oh, my God. I know.It's stuck.
小心台阶  它怎么会跑到你头上012---Step. How did it get on?
是我套上去想吓钱德012---I put it on to scare Chandler.
天哪  摩妮卡一定会气死012---Oh, my God. Monica's going to totally freak out.
赶快帮我拿下来012---Well, then help me get it off.
这里面好臭012---Plus, it smells really bad in here.
当然很臭  你的头塞在动物尸体的屁股里012---Of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
你替火鸡涂 … 我的天哪012---Hey, did you get the turkey...? Oh, my God!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
那是谁  乔伊啦012---Who is that? It's Joey.
你在干什么  你是在搞笑吗012---What are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
不是搞笑  是吓人012---No, it's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be scary.
马上给我拿掉012---Get that off now.
拿不掉  卡住了012---I can't. It's stuck.
我不管  我爸妈的20个客人012---Well, I don't care. That turkey has to feed 20 people.
不能就着你的头吃012---They're not going to eat it off your head.
先别急  大家一起想办法012---Hold on, okay? Let's just all think.
我知道了  菲比012---Okay, I got it. Phoebe?
这样  你拉012---All right. You pull.
我尽量把腿撑开012---I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.
乔伊  现在不要闹  对不起012---Joey, now is not the time. Yeah. Sorry. Right, sorry.
好  数到三  一  二  三012---Okay, count to three. One, two...three.
成功了  我吓到你了  看吧012---It worked. I scared you. I knew it. Ha, ha!
大哥  我在这里012---I'm over here, big guy.
我知道012---Yeah, you are. Ha, ha!
我吓到你了012---I scared you. Whoo!
你看起来真的很白痴012---You did look like an idiot.
白痴的不只是我012---Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot, all right?
罗斯有一次想说冬南瓜012---Remember when Ross tried to say "butternut squash"...
结果讲成南冬瓜012---...and it came out, "squatternut bosh"?
的确  一样白痴012---Yeah, that's the same.
那就是我最惨的感恩节012---That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving.
等等  瑞秋说的不可能是那次012---Oh, wait. That can't be the one that Rachel was talking about...
她根本不知道那件事012---...because she didn't even know that that happened.
所以是哪次  哪次012---So, what's yours? What was it?
我真的不想提这件事012---Um, I really don't wanna tell this story.
讲嘛  莫妮卡012---Oh, come on, Monica.
重温悲惨的回忆  是感恩节的精神012---Reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving's all about.
至少我觉得是  还有原住民的帮忙012---You know, for me, anyway. And, of course, the Indians.
最不希望我提的绝对是你012---Look, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story.
什么意思012---What is that supposed to mean?
摩妮卡  应该是瑞秋来了012---Monica, I think Rachel's here.
我来开012---I'll get it.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving.
我不快乐  奇普和我分手了012---Not for me.Chip and I broke up.
为什么  怎么了012---Oh. Why? Well, what happened?
我爸妈不是要出门  奇普不是要来么012---You know how my parents are out of town, and Chip was gonna come over?
对  你要给他你的花芯012---Yeah, yeah. And you were gonna give him, you know...your "flower."
摩妮卡  你能不能直接说做爱012---Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?
你那样讲让我浑身发毛012---It really creeps me out when you call it that.
还有012---Okay, and by the way...
在做的时候  男人的那里不叫他的温柔012---...while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his "tenderness."
相信我012---Believe me.
嗨  瑞秋012---Hi.Hi, Rachel.
感恩节快乐  你也是012---Happy Thanksgiving. You too, sweetheart.
各位  这是钱德012---Uh, everyone...this is Chandler.
我的室友兼我们乐团的主唱012---My roommate and lead singer of our band. Heh.
罗斯012---Ross?
这是摩妮卡  我是罗斯的妹妹012---Oh. This is Monica.Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.
好012---Okay.
欢迎你来   钱德012---I'm so glad you could come, Chandler.
有很多吃的  希望你饿了012---We've got plenty of food, so I hope you're hungry.
妈  钱德痛恨感恩节  他不吃感恩节食物012---Oh, Mom, no, no, Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
那还真是欢迎啊012---Oh. Well, I'm so glad you brought him here, then.
钱德  我可以帮你煮起司通心面012---Hey, Chandler, If you want, I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
只要当年的清教徒没吃  我就吃012---As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it, then I'm in.
讨厌012---Damn it.
瑞秋012---So, uh, Rach...
我去上大学不在012---Does it...? Does it feel weird around here now?
你会不会觉得怪怪的012---You know, since I've been away at college?
那倒不会  那就好012---Oh.No, not really. That's cool.
那你012---So...
奇普居然为了那个花痴南西  而甩了我012---Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut, Nancy Branson.
我再也不跟他约会了012---I am never going out with him again.
他再怎么求我也没用012---I don't care how much he begs.
他有了南西  应该不会求你了012---I think his begging days are over, now that he's with Nancy Branson.
你知道吗  我受够高中男生了012---You know what? I've just had it with high-school boys.
他们全是些又笨又呆的小毛头012---They're just silly.They're just silly, stupid boys.
我要开始跟男人交往012---I'm gonna start dating men.
茱蒂  对不起  我找不到你和杰克要的碗012---Uh, I'm sorry, Judy.I couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for.
叫爸爸妈妈吧012---Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.
摩妮卡012---Monica.
钱德012---Hey, Chandler?
起司通心面好吃吗012---Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
很好吃  你应该去当厨师012---Oh, yeah. It was great. You should be a chef.
好啊012---Okay.
你猜怎样  南西很花痴的传闻都是假的012---Guess what. All this stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor.
所以奇普甩了她  他今天晚上想来找我012---Chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house tonight.
太棒了  就是啊012---Oh, that is so great. I know.
天哪  要是你和奇普晚上做了012---Oh, gosh. Listen, if you and Chip do it tonight...
你一定要把细节都告诉我012---...um, promise me you'll tell me everything?
那当然  其实也没什么  我们应该有做过一次012---Oh, totally, totally. It's not that big a deal. We already kind of did it once, you know.
我知道  但这回你一定能确定  我知道012---I know, but this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it.I know.
奇普还保证  这次会持续一整首歌的长度012---Oh, and Chip promised that this time it would last at least for an entire song.
我晚上打算约瑞秋出去012---So I'm thinking of asking Rachel out tonight.
弹我们上周写的那首歌给她听012---You know, maybe playing her that song we wrote last week.
"忧愁的背包"012---"Emotional Knapsack"?
对  漂亮012---Yes. Right on.
不过不要拖太久012---Oh, uh, but don't take long, okay?
我们还要去试用假身份证012---Because we're testing our fake ID's tonight.
对吧  克里夫艾维瑞兹012---Right, Clifford Alvarez?
听着  罗兰陈012---Listen, Roland Cheng...
如果一切顺利  我们搞不好不会回来012---...if things go well, I may be out with her all night.
兄弟  别丢下我012---Dude, don't do that to me.
没关系  你可以留下来  我爸妈不会介意012---Oh, no. It's cool, you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
不是  我不想整晚  跟你的肥猪妹妹在一起012---It's not that. I don't wanna be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
摩妮卡  把这些派吃完吧012---Monica, why don't you finish off these pies?
冰箱里塞不下了012---I don't have any more room in the fridge.
不  不了  谢谢012---No.No, thank you.
茱蒂  你成功了  她终于吃不下了012---Well, Judy, you did it. She's finally full.
我说你肥  我完全不记得012---I called you fat? I don't even remember that.
我可记得012---Well, I do.
对不起  真的  我那时候很愚蠢012---I'm so sorry. I really am. But, come on, I was an idiot back then.
我还在"轰"的演唱会上  冲上台大叫012---I rushed the stage at a Wham! Concert, for crying out loud.
你居然说她肥012---Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
你居然让乔治麦可赏你耳光012---I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
真的很抱歉  我太差劲了  真是对不起012---I am really sorry.That is so terrible. I'm so, so sorry.
其实我说的不是那次感恩节012---Actually, that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
就是 不是  我说的是…012---Yes, it was. No, it wasn't. It was actually...
好吧  感恩节结束了  准备过圣诞节吧012---Ok. Thanksgiving's over. Get ready for Christmas.
谁要去买圣诞树012---Who wants to get a Christmas tree?
我有最可爱的圣诞节故事012---Oh, no. I have the cutest Christmas story.
我们想听摩妮卡的感恩节故事012---We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story.
我的故事里有小矮人断成两截  不过随便012---Fine, all right. Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half.But, you know, whatever.
瑞秋  你妈说你又转系了012---So, Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again?
没办法  心理系馆旁边很难停车012---Oh, yeah, I had to.There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
瑞秋012---Hi, Rachel. Oh, hi.
你的新鼻子真漂亮  杰克012---Wow. Love your new nose. Jack.
怎样  威尔森医生是个艺术家012---What? Dr. Wolfson's an artist.
他帮我点掉一堆痣  你要看吗012---He removed my mole cluster.Want to see?
我去开  不  让我去012---No, God. Please, let me.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving. Hi.
你的发型变了好多012---God, your hair sure is different.
我们刚才还在讲012---Yeah, we were just talking about that.
我们以前真的好蠢012---Can't we can't believe how stupid we used to look.
摩妮卡呢012---So, uh, where's Monica?
在楼上  摩妮卡  快下来  人都到齐了012---She's upstairs. Monica. Come down, everyone's here.
罗斯  瑞秋  和那个痛恨感恩节的男生012---Ross, Rachel and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
钱德  我的天哪012---Hi, Chandler.Oh, my God.
怎么了  我的衣服有脏东西吗012---What's the matter? Is there something on my dress?
你变了好多  看起来好漂亮012---You just... You look so different. Terrific.
那件裙子  那个身材012---That dress, that body...
喂  抱歉012---Dude. Sorry.
对  摩妮卡瘦了  太好了012---Yes, yes, Monica is thin. It's wonderful.
但我们比较关心罗斯的新女友  妈…012---But what we really want to hear about is Ross' new girlfriend.Oh, Mom...
好吧  她叫卡萝012---Okay. Um, ahem, her name is Carol...
她很漂亮  很聪明012---...and she's really pretty and smart.
她是长曲棍球和高尔夫球校队  很厉害吧012---And, uh, she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team.Can you believe it?
她两个校队都打012---She plays for both teams.
钱德   那就晚餐见了012---So, Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
喂  抱歉012---Dude. Sorry.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
真是酷毙了012---That was so awesome.
你完全报了一箭之仇012---You totally got him back for calling you fat.
他的口水流了满地012---He was just drooling all over you.
感觉一定很过瘾012---That must have felt so great.
一点也不过瘾   什么012---Well, it didn't. What?
没错  我很漂亮012---Yeah, I mean, I look great.
感觉很轻盈  心脏的毛病也没了012---And yeah, I feel great, and, yeah, my heart's not in trouble anymore.
但我还是觉得没报到仇  懂吗012---I just don't feel like I got him back, you know?
我想狠狠的羞辱他012---I mean, I just want to humiliate him.
我想让他光着身体012---I want him to be, like, naked...
再指着他大笑012---...and I want to point at him and I wanna laugh.
好  搞不好可以012---Okay. That, we may be able to do.
怎么做012---How?
男人要做爱之前都会脱光衣服012---Well, guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
什么  我这么努力瘦这么多012---What? I mean, I didn't work this hard and lose all this weight...
可不是为了把花蕊给他那种人012---...just so I could give my flower to someone like him.
好  第一   你再那样讲  保证没有人会要你012---Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one is ever gonna take it.
第二  又不是要你来真的012---And then second of all, you're not gonna actually have sex with him.
只是要你误导他012---You're just gonna make him think that you are.
也对012---Yeah. Yeah.
等他脱光了012---And then when he's naked...
我就把他赶出去  锁上门012---...I can throw him out, lock the door...
让所有的邻居耻笑他012---...and all our neighbors will just humiliate him.
那你就绝对报了仇012---And then you will definitely get him back.
我要怎么误导他012---Okay, so how do I make him think I want to have sex with him?
我知道了012---Uh, Oh! Here's what you do.
假装什么都能让你兴奋012---Just act like everything around you turns you on.
什么意思  就是什么都能挑逗你012---What do you mean? Well, like, anything can be sexy.
像…像这条擦碗巾012---Like, um... Oh, okay. Like this dish towel.
它的触感好舒服012---This feels so good against my cheek.
如果我热了  就可以拿它来吸汗012---And if I get a little hot, I can just dab myself with it.
或是把它放在腿边  边跟他说话边玩弄012---Or I can bring it down to my side and maybe run it through my fingers while I talk to him.
这个我会  很好  很好012---I can do that. Okay, good, good, good.
行了  他来了  他来了012---Get busy. He's coming. He's coming.
嗨  你好  嗨012---Hey, what's up? Hey.
摩妮卡  你能不能帮我煮  去年那种通心面012---Monica. I was wondering if you could make me some mac and cheese like last year?
没问题012---I'd love to.
我好喜欢起司通心面012---Ooh.I love macaroni and cheese.
我好喜欢这个盒子的触感012---I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
好  我好喜欢红萝卜012---Okay. Ooh, and I love carrots.
有时我喜欢把它们这样夹着012---Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers.
然后放在腿边跟你说话012---Like this. And hold them down here while I talk to you.
觉得很热的时候…012---Um, and, you know, if I get really hot...
我喜欢拿起这把刀  把冰凉的刀身靠在012---...um, I like to pick up this knife. And, um, I put the cool steel against
身上012---...my body.
你还好吗012---Are you all right?
我很好012---I'm fine.
什么状况  20岁男性012---What do got? Twenty-year-old male.
右脚拇趾被切到012---He's got a severed toe on his right foot.
别撞到他的脚  好吗012---Could you please not do that feet first?
你明知他是拇趾被切到  你刚才也说了012---You know where his injury is. Severed toe, you just said it!
这里说刀子刺穿鞋子012---It says here the knife went right through your shoe.
那当然  他穿的是草鞋012---Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
断指带来了吗  有012---Did you bring the toe? Oh, yes.
在这里冰着012---I have it right here on ice.
放心  我们会把它缝…012---Don't worry, son. We'll just reattach it and then...
怎么了012---What is it?
你带了一块红萝卜来012---You brought a carrot.
什么  这不是你的脚趾012---What? This isn't your toe.
这是一小块  很冰的红萝卜012---This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
你带红萝卜来012---You brought a carrot?
天哪  我的厨房里有一截断趾012---Oh, my God.There's a toe in my kitchen.
对不起  我马上回去拿012---God, I'm sorry. I'll go back and get it.
来不及了  我们只能直接缝合012---It's too late. All we can do is sew up the wound.
我需要我的脚趾头012---Without my toe? I need my toe. Okay.
等一下  我很快  爸  让我开你的保时捷012---No, no, no. I can go really fast. Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.
我才不会上当012---Oh, I'm not falling for that one.
这就是我断趾的原因  因为我说你肥012---That's why I lost my toe? Because I called you fat?
我不是故意的  那是意外012---I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
我就因为这样被叫了一整年的  跛脚趾头先生012---That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?
对不起嘛  又不是一整根脚趾头012---I'm sorry. It wasn't your whole toe.
我少了趾尖  趾尖最棒012---Yeah, well, I miss the tip.It's the best part.
趾尖有指甲012---It has the nail.
钱德012---Chandler...
跛脚趾头先生  那是我想出来的012---Sir Limps-a-lot.I came up with that.
你好无聊012---You're a dork.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
钱德  我都道歉了012---Chandler, I said I was sorry.
道歉也换不回  我那思乡情切的小趾尖012---Yeah, well, "sorry" doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home.
我恨感恩节和这一天的一切012---I hate this stupid day and everything about it.
回见  等等  钱德  过来012---I'll see you later. Wait, Chandler.Come here.
有什么我能做的吗  任何事012---Is there anything I can do? Anything?
有  让我静一静012---Yeah, just leave me alone for a little while.
我是鸭子呱呱呱  一天到晚都快乐012---Oh, I'm a duck. I go quack-quack. I'm happy all the time.
别试了  等等012---Nice try.Wait, wait, wait.
摩妮卡  你看012---Look, Monica... Look.
没有用的012---This is not gonna work.
接下来绝对有用012---I bet this will work.
你真绝  我爱你012---You're so great. I love you.
什么012---What?
没事  我说 "你真绝"  然后就没说话了012---Nothing. I said you're so great, and then I just stopped talking.
你说你爱我  我真不敢相信012---You said you loved me. I can't believe this.
不  我没有012---No, I didn't.
你有  我没有012---Yes, you did. No, I didn't.
你爱我  我没有012---You love me. No, I don't.
别再说了  别再说了012---Stop it, stop it, stop it.
纱布  纱布  这里需要纱布012---Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here!
请再给我一些纱…012---Can I please get some more gauze?
真是越来越扯了012---This is getting ridiculous.
我是坐到什么东东啊012---What am I sitting on?
"世界之顶"  "河堤码头"012---Top of the world? Dock of the bay?
想不出来了012---I'm out.
喔  内裤012---Oh, ew, undies! Oh.
老实说  谁的012---All right, whose are they?
谁的012---Whose are they?
不是我的012---Not mine.
是乔伊的   一定是他的012---Joey's. Got to be Joey's.
的确是我的012---They're mine.
看吧  就是乔伊的  乔...伊的012---See, Joey's. They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.
怎么会在这里012---Why are they here?
我不知道...012---I don't know, uh...
因为我是乔伊012---I'm Joey.
我生性龌龊  随便在别人家脱内裤012---I'm disgusting.I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
快拿走  你有病啊012---Get them out of here. What's wrong with you?
对啊  好恶心012---Yeah. Yeah.
拿去啊  好...012---Take them! I got them.
乔伊  你干嘛不敢碰  这是你自己的内裤012---Joey, You can touch them. They're your underwear.
钱德  借步说话  好012---Chandler? A word? Yeah.
我受够了  不想再帮你们说谎了012---That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two. .
这种鸟事不能再发生了012---This has got to stop. Aah
而且还是白色紧身三角裤012---Ahh! And tighty-whiteys!
你8岁吗012---What are you, 8?
谢谢你  乔伊  感激不尽012---Thank you, Joey, so much.
我一点都不情愿012---You're not welcome, okay?
我讨厌这样012---Look, I hate this.
你们总是害我出丑012---You guys keep embarrassing me.
昨天瑞秋在这的浴室  看到你的剃毛刀012---Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom.
我不知道怎么回答012---and I didn't know what to say,
只好说是我的012---so I said it was mine
还说我要在话剧里演女人012---and-and that I was playing a woman in a play.
结果还得一不做二不休012---Then one thing led to another and...
哇  连脚踝周围都剃光了  那里很不好刮啊012---And around the ankles, that is a tough spot.
没错  告诉你们  我不能...012---Yeah, It was. All right, listen...
要说谎我们也不好受012---All this lying has been hard on us too.
是啊  不过至少你们有上床012---Yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier.
那倒是012---Yeah, actually.
我们下次一定会更小心012---We'll be more careful.
因为我们实在太顺利了  所以还不想让别人知道012---we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well
搞不好就是保密才能这么顺利012---and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret..
我知道你觉得很怪  但我们都不太会处理感情问题012---I know it sounds really weird, but we're so bad at relationships.
没错  帮帮忙  拜托012---We are. Help us. Help.
好吧  不过...012---All right. But,
你要跟我上一次床012---you do it with me once.
乔伊  就知道你不肯012---Joey! Didn't think so.

竟然给人偷吃掉012---I can't believe someone ate it.
罗斯  不过是个三明治嘛012---Ross, It's just a sandwich.

我今年30岁  已经离婚两次  还没地方可住012---Look, I am 30 years old, okay? I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted!
那个三明治是我人生中  唯一美好的事物012---That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life!
我唯一美好的事物  竟然给人偷吃掉012---Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
我还有材料可以再做一个012---I have enough stuff for one more sandwich,
我本来自己要吃...012---I was going to eat it myself, but...
太好了  真是谢谢你012---Mon, that would be incredible. Thank you so much.
我到现在还不相信有人偷吃了012---I still can't believe someone ate it!
我还留了一张纸条在上面012---Look, I left a note and everything.
喂  谁啊012---"Knock-knock." "Who's there?"
罗斯盖勒的午餐012---"Ross Geller's lunch."
哪个罗斯盖勒的午餐012---"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"
这是罗斯盖勒的午餐  请勿偷走我  好吗"012---"Ross Geller's lunch. Please don't take me. Okay?"
你没被扁  就该偷笑了012---I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
不想让别人偷吃你的东西012---Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food?
那就得吓吓他们  这是我在街头流浪学到的012---You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
真的  你会怎么说  菲比012---Really? So what would you say Pheebs?
比如 "脏手少碰我的馊水"012---Stuff like, uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub."
罗斯  你以为菲比当年是在演《安妮》吗012---Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
贴上这张纸条就没人敢偷吃了012---Okay, This'll keep them away from your stuff.
哇...012---Whoa! Ohh!!
菲比  你真狠012---Phoebe, you are a badass!
下次再告诉你们  我拿刀捅条子的事012---Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
菲比  是他先捅我的012---Phoebe. He stabbed me first!
布朗蒂姊妹是当代的杰出女性012---The Bronte sisters were remarkable women for their time.
当时是父系社会012---They lived in a patriarchal society.
抱歉迟到了  因为我出门太晚了012---Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
好吧012---Ahem. Okay.
菲比  这本书说什么012---So Pheebs, what is the book about?
你说你高中念过012---Didn't you read it in high school?
对  后来我想起我开始看时  正好碰上要为球队打气012---Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was,
我又是啦啦队的队长012---I was on top of the pyramid .
就是这样啦  到底在说什么012---but anyway.umm, what is this book about?
这是凯西跟希克里夫的悲惨爱情故事012---Okay, umm, It's a tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff.
故事发生在英国一座恐怖的山庄012---and umm, It takes place on these creepy moors in England.
场景就代表  男主角性格中狂野的一面012---Which I think represent the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
我对象征主义很有一套012---I totally get symbolism.
这本书的主题是什么012---How would you characterize the theme of this book?
看看找谁  瑞秋葛林012---Uh, let's see... Rachel Green?
这是个爱情悲剧012---Umm, well I would have to say that it's a tragic love story.
非常明显  不过你说得也没错012---That's sort of a given...but, yes.
还有谁有意见012---Anyone else?
还有象征性的意义012---Oh, oh, oh. Symbolism!
狂野的场景...012---And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores...
我觉得反映出  男主角性格中桀骜的一面012---which I think is mirrored in the wildness of  Heathcliff's character.
非常好012---Excellent!
瑞秋读得相当透彻012---What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
你根本就是照我说的回答012---You completely stole my answer!
亲爱的  随便看看就知道了012---Honey, that was pretty obvious.
你哪晓得  你根本没看过012---Well how would you know? You didn't read it!
你有意见012---What do you think?
穿蓝衬衫这位同学012---Uh, you in the blue shirt?
我认为这个问题  有很多可能的答案012---I think that, um, yours is a question with many possible answers.
那就麻烦你举出一个012---Would you care to venture one?
你愿意说一个吗012---Would you care to venture one?
你是重复我的话吗012---Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
你是重复我的话吗012---Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
好吧  我们继续012---All right. Let's move on.
好012---Okay, then.
你为什么不直接说你没看过012---Why didn't you say you hadn't read the book?
我不希望他认为我很蠢012---because I didn't want him to think I was stupid.
你看看你多蠢啊012---That was really embarrassing, what happened to you.
菲比  什么012---Phoebe! Phoebe! Yeah?
你那张纸条  真是了不起012---Your note? Amazing!
不但没人敢碰我的三明治012---Not only did no one touch my sandwich...
而且还开始对我敬畏三分012---...but people at work are actually afraid of me.
还有人叫我 "疯子"  "疯子盖勒"012---A guy called me "Mental.""Mental Geller."
我一直梦想有这种超酷的外号012---I've always wanted a cool nickname like that.
以前你最酷的外号  就是 "尿裤子盖勒"012---The best you got in high school was, uh, "Wet Pants Geller."
那是饮水机喷到的012---That was the water fountain, okay?
现在有人愿意帮我写报告012---Anyway...people are writing reports for me...
我爱什么时候交就什么时候交012---...uh, pushing back deadlines to fit my schedule.
原来对人耍狠  就可以呼风唤雨012---I tell you, you get tough with people and you can get anything you want.
崔比亚尼  咖啡拿来012---Hey, Tribbiani! Give me that coffee! Now!
今天真有意思012---This was really fun.
我本来还怀疑你会不会约我012---I've been wondering if you'd ask me out.
你还在怀疑吗012---So you, uh, still wondering?
不  我们刚刚才约过会啊012---No. We just went out.
你真聪明  我喜欢012---You're smart.I like that.
还有蜡烛啊012---Oh, candles!
这是什么  毯子  摄影机  我的天啊012---What is that, a blanket?A video camera? Oh, my God!
不是这样...等等啊012---No, no, no. Wait.
不敢相信你竟然在第一次约会  就想拍下我们上床过程012---I can't believe you thought you'd video tape us having sex on the first date!
你好012---Hi.
乔伊  她刚说的...012---Joey, is what she just said, um...
天啊  你还真打算...012---Oh, my God!You're actually gonna
这是怎么回事012---What is going on here?
而且钱德还在家  你是...你变态吗012---And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
我是乔伊啊012---I'm Joey.
我本来就很恶心012---I mean, I'm disgusting.
还拍低成本的色情片012---I make low-budget adult films.
你们答应我  要更小心的012---You guys promised to be more careful!
乔伊的好名声都给你们毁了012---I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
对不起  抱歉012---We're so sorry.
我要把你们的事情说出去012---Well, I'm telling everyone about you!
否则内裤跟摄影机的事  只会让人觉得  我是变态猪啰012---That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
不-不  等一下  一定有其他方法012---No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation.
你可以说你在拍色情片  因为你在...上色情片的课012---You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your...adult film class.
这理由还不错  不行012---Yeah, I like that. But no-no,
瑞秋在你家  发现我内裤的事又怎么说012---how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
不知道012---I don't know.
看来你们得出柜承认了012---Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
拜托你等等  我保证一定会想出理由012---Okay, just wait, please.I promise to come up with something.
再让我们多缓几天012---Just give us a little more time.
好吧  最好让我能保住面子012---All right Hey, but it better make me look really, really good.
还有...摄影机012---Oh, and another thing, the video camera?
了不起012---Nice!
罗斯  可以跟你谈谈吗012---Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
当然  唐诺012---Of course, Donald.
有同事抱怨你最近脾气火爆012---We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
什么012---What? .
写信威胁大家  拒绝按时交报告012---Threatening letters..refusal to meet deadlines.
还有人叫你是 "疯子"012---Apparently people now call you Mental.
是啊012---Yeah.
我们希望你找精神科医生谈谈012---We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
不  你不懂  其实是误会012---Oh, no. Uh, you...You don't understand. This is so silly.
一切要从我的三明治说起012---Um, this is all just because of a sandwich.
三明治012---A sandwich?
我妹妹非常会做火鸡三明治012---You see, my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches.
她的秘诀就是  多夹一片浸过肉汁的面包在中间012---Her secret is, she puts an extra slice of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.
我称那片为 "多汁秘方"012---I call it "The Moistmaker."
有一次我把三明治放在冰箱012---Anyway, I put my sandwich in the fridge...
你知道吗  什么012---Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you know what?
对不起  应该是我吃掉了012---I'm sorry.I believe I ate that.
你吃了我的三明治012---You ate my sandwich?
我一时看错  谁都可能拿错012---A simple mistake. It can happen to anyone.
是吗012---Oh, really?
难道你的三明治  也有"多汁秘方"012---Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?
没有  难道你没看到上面的纸条012---No, I...Do you, perhaps, remember...seeing a note on top of it?
我以为那是有人开玩笑  或是随手写的打油诗012---There may have been a joke or limerick of some kind.
上面清楚写着那是我的三明治012---That said it was...my sandwich!
你别激动012---Now calm down.
可以到我办公室找找  可能垃圾筒里还有剩012---Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
什么012---What?
那个三明治很大012---Well, it was quite large.
我必须丢掉一大半012---I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
你...丢掉我的三明治012---You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away?
我的三明治012---My sandwich?
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
这本书在讲什么012---So umm, What's this book about?
这本你也没看012---You didn't read it, either?
我本来是要看  结果却看了其它的书012---Well, I was going to, but I, uh, accidentally read something else.
什么012---What?
时尚杂志012---Vogue.
跟我说这本《简爱》是在说什么012---Hey, So tell me about Jane Eyre.
不行  你应该自己看012---No, You should've read it yourself!
菲比  别这么假正经嘛012---Come on Phoebe! don't be such a goody-goody.
好吧012---Fine.
简爱呢  你会以为她是女人  其实不然012---Okay, all right. So Jane Eyre? First you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.
她是生化人012---She's a cyborg.
生化人  就是机器人012---A cyborg? Isn't that like a robot?
这本书在当时超级先进012---Yeah, This book was light years ahead of its time.
抱歉迟到  开始上课吧012---Sorry I'm late. Let's get started.
大家对《简爱》有何感想012---So, What did you think of Jane Eyre?
瑞秋刚跟我讨论过  她有些看法非常有趣012---Um, Rachel and I were discussing it, and she actually had very interesting insights.
请说  瑞秋012---Go ahead, Rachel.
谢谢你  菲比012---Um, thank you, Phoebe.
《简爱》最让我震惊的就是012---Umm, well, What struck me most when reading Jane Eyre...
这本书非常惊世骇俗012---...was, uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
如果你指的是女性主义  这么说也成012---If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
当然有写到女性主义  不过还有机器人012---Well, feminism, yes. But also the robots.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
既然上次拍摄不成功012---Since that video camera thing didn't work out...
我先给你一点预告片段012---...I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
你在照片中没穿衣服012---You're naked in this picture!
我知道012---I know!
罗斯012---Ross?
钱德012---Hey, Chandler.
摩妮卡012---Monica!
罗斯  你没事吧012---Ross, Are you okay?
我很好012---I'm fine.
我今天上班去看过精神医生012---I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
为什么012---Why?
因为我脾气太暴躁012---On account of my rage.
而且最近越来越严重012---Which, if I may say, right now is out of control.
所以他开药丸给我012---He gave me a pill for it.
药丸012---A pill?
医生说我对上司大吼大叫012---Uh-huh. When the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence...
所以应该请假012---...because I yelled at my boss,
我又开始暴跳如雷012---I started to get worked up again.
所以他要我吃颗镇定剂012---So he offered me a tranquilizer.
我觉得这主意不错012---And I thought it was a good idea.
所以就吃了012---So I took it.
等等  他们逼你请假012---Wait a minute, They're making you take time off work?
而且你也同意012---And you're okay with that?
我不知道012---I don't know.
刚开始不工作可能不习惯012---It's going to be weird not having a job for a while.
不过我已经不在乎三明治了012---But I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
我丢脸丢大了  你竟然还让我一直说下去012---That's so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on like that!
对不起012---I'm sorry.
你把简爱比成机器战警  实在太爆笑了012---It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
一点也不好笑012---That was not funny!
我太气了012---I snapped, okay?
你根本不想好好上课012---You weren't taking the class seriously.
菲比  这有什么了不起012---Phoebe, Come on! What is the big deal?
我以为我们就是一起出去012---I thought it'd be something we could do together.
上课打发时间闹着玩012---Y'know, I thought it would be fun.
好玩很重要012---Well, yeah! Fun is good.
但是我也想学点东西012---but y'know I also wanted to learn.
大家老说在高中学东学西  我却没上过高中012---People talk about what they learned in high school. I never went to high school.
所以你真的想学东西012---Ohh. Oh, So you really wanted to learn.
但是  菲比  我只想找点乐子012---Yeah, y'know, Pheebs, I just wanted to have fun.
你知道你该拉谁去吗012---Ohh, you know who you should go with?
我知道...012---I know! I know! I know!
摩妮卡  问题是你提的012---Monica, you asked the question.
天啊  是摩妮卡012---Oh, my God, that's Monica!
不是这样...你别误会012---Oh, no, no, no!
离我远点  你这个大变态012---You get away from me, You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
怎么啦012---What's going on?
乔伊有偷窥癖012---Joey has got a secret peephole!
天啊...012---Oh, no, no, no, no!
对  他有摩妮卡的裸体照片012---Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica!
他拍下我们裸体的样子012---He takes naked pictures of us,
还一边吃鸡块一边看012---then he eats chicken and looks at them!
你们看  那是我老妹啊012---Look. Oh! Dude, that's my sister!
给我  等下  大家先别激动012---Give me that! All right, Wait! Everybody just calm down. Okay?
要给我们的老友乔伊  有机会解释他为何如此变态012---Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
我不是变态好吗012---No! I am not a pervert! Okay?
只是...我...其实...012---It's just...I just kind of...
大家听我说  我可以帮他解释012---All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
谢谢012---Thank you.
乔伊是性爱狂012---Joey's a sex addict.
什么  才怪012---What? No, I'm not!
没关系  不怪你012---It's okay! It's good! It's good.
这只是一种病012---It's a disease.
胡说  我才不是性爱狂012---No! No! I am not a sex addict!
你明明就是012---Yes, you are!
这才能解释最近这一连串的事012---That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
事实不是这样012---No, it isn't. No, it's not.
你也可以说出真相012---Because you could also explain it with the truth!
什么真相012---What is the truth?
怎么回事  你在说什么012---What's up? What's going on?
我跟摩妮卡上床了012---I slept with Monica.
听听大家怎么说012---Well, let's see what everybody thinks of that.
天啊012---Oh, no.
你跟我老妹上床012---You slept with my sister?
对  只在伦敦发生过一次012---Uh, yes, but it was...We just did it once, uh, in London.
这会让我开始抓狂012---This is not good for my rage.
摩妮卡  是真的吗012---Monica.Is this true?
当然是真的012---Of course, it's true.
否则怎么解释这些怪事012---How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
是真的012---Yes, it's true.
如果只发生过一次012---Okay, but if it only happened that one time,
你的内裤  怎么会出现在我们家012---how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
那件内裤是我当天在伦敦穿的  对不对  摩妮卡012---That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
我想留下来...当纪念品012---I guess I wanted to keep it...as a souvenir.
天啊  摩妮卡012---My God, Monica!
你确定  乔伊  你确定你不是性爱狂012---Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
不  要是有人是性爱狂  那也是摩妮卡012---No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica!
没错  打我们从伦敦回来  她就想再勾引我上床012---Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
所以她才拍裸照给你012---That's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
这样说得通012---That makes sense.
录影机呢012---And the video camera?
摩妮卡012---Uh, Monica?
我架好录影机是为了引诱乔伊上钩012---I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
可惜我不吃这套012---But, sadly, I could not be enticed.
不可思议  你还留下乔伊的内裤012---Unbelievable! You really kept Joey's underwear?
为什么  你为什么这么做012---Why? Why would you do that?
因为我是摩妮卡012---I'm Monica.
生性下流012---I'm disgusting.
我会跟踪男人  留下他们的内裤012---I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
现在终于知道谁是恶心鬼了012---Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh?
好了  我要开始吃炸鸡了012---All right. Now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.
我只吃鸡皮  你们可以吃鸡肉012---I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
你说得很有道理012---I really thought you making a good point.
可惜后来被打断012---I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
我知道  那个摩妮卡哪里有病啊012---What's up with that girl Monica?
谁晓得  她不是我朋友012---I don't know. I didn't come with her.
好消息  各位  你们猜怎么了012---Hey, everybody! Everybody, guess what!
我说服卡尔下周考试012---I just convinced Carl to give us a test next week!.
考试012---Test?
开心点  有考试才有进步012---Come on! Tests make us all better learners!
对了  应该考申论题012---Oh, yeah! We should have essay questions!
你在做什么  我重新整理过冰箱012---What are you doing? I reorganized the fridge, heh.
看  最底下  放肉跟奶制品012---See? Uh, bottom shelf, meats and dairy.

很遗憾012---I'm sorry, man.
你知道该怎么做吗012---You know what you should do?
你要自己创造机会012---You should make something happen for yourself.
例如  写部电影剧本012---You know, like write a play.
就像《心灵捕手》那两个012---Write a movie, huh? What about those Good Will Hunting guys?
罗斯  少作白日梦了  就算我写出剧本012---Come on, Ross. Be realistic, you know? If I did write something...
哪有办法请到他们来演012---...what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
有了  我可以自己主演  也可以012---Wait a second. I could star in it! Or that.

开始慢慢来  今晚之前012---We'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight...
只要想好主角名字012---...is come up with the name of your main character.
好了  不能是乔伊012---Done. And it can't be Joey.
不是  也不能是约瑟夫012---It's not. Or Joseph.
嗨  你怎么啦012---Hi. What's up?
我刚看到丹尼跟女生搭地铁012---I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl...
他还搂着她012---...and he had his arm around her.
宝贝  我真为你难过012---Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
你的确该难过  一切都要怪你012---Well, you should be. This is all your fault.
谁叫你插手我们的感情世界012---You meddled in our relationship.
你们根本没在一起012---You had no relationship.
不过我已经拟好计划012---No, but I was doing my thing, and everything...
一切都按部就班进行中012---...was going according to the plan!
拜托  别再提你的鸟计划了012---Oh, God. Stop with the plan.
那么  你看到他跟女生在一起012---Unh. So what if you saw him with a girl?
又如何  他们不见得是情人012---Who cares? That doesn't mean anything.
你就快跟丹尼约会了  到时你可以火力全开  迷得他012---You'll go out on a date with Danny and be so charming he'll forget all about...
忘记地铁那个蠢妞012---...that stupid subway girl.
那女生的确傻里傻气的012---She was kind of stupid.
你说得对  好  我这就去赴约012---You're right. All right. I'm just gonna go on the date.
我会去赴约  这就是我的新计划012---I'm just gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
快点  快点012---Hurry, hurry!
"多疑" 怎么写  干嘛012---Hey, how do you spell "suspicious"? Why?
因为这个角色很 "多疑"012---Because I think this character is gonna be suspicious about stuff.
对012---Yes!
钱德宾7分  钱德宾0分012---Chandler Bing, seven, Chandler Bing, zero.
看你玩那个都快让我抓狂了012---You're driving me crazy with that.
好  我不玩就是了  不  继续玩012---Okay, I'll stop. No, don't stop.
碗拿远一点  连罗斯都投得进012---Move the bowl further away. Ross could make that shot.
真是酷死了  不过你至少进了成人组012---Well, you suck. But at least you suck at a man's game now.
要不要玩  我不能跟你玩012---You wanna play? I can't be playing games.
罗斯就快回来了  按照他的时间表  我今天应该写完5页012---Ross will be home soon. I have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.
你可以先玩30分钟  再继续用功到他回家012---Well, so play for the next 30 minutes, then you can write until he gets home.
好吧012---All right.
不过  规则应该012---But, listen, what do you say we, uh...
更上一层楼012---...crank it up a notch?
愿闻其详012---I'm intrigued.
要先找到可燃性液体012---All right. All we need is a little lighter fluid.
好  不过你小心点  我还想拿回房租订金012---Okay, but be careful. I wanna get our security deposit back.
我们发明铁鎚标枪时  就拿不回来了012---Yeah, I think we said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.
你记得哪面墙壁没补过吗012---Do you remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
记得  这里012---Uh, yeah, right here.
谢谢  佳节愉快012---Thank you. Happy holiday.
小姐  那可是垃圾  不可以012---No, that's trash, young lady. No, you can't--
嘿  阻止那位小姐  她竟然捐垃圾012---Hey. Stop that young lady! She donated trash!
嘿012---Hey.
捐筒着火了012---The charity's on fire!
来人啊  太好了  谢谢  我正需要012---Help! Good, thank you. I need that.
那是什么鬼东西  现在才早上9点啊012---What is this? It's 9:00 in the morning.
我看看“场景  房间012---All right. "A room.
一名男子  多疑地走进来”012---A man enters. He looks suspicious."
就这样012---That's it?
乔伊  你今天应该写5页012---Joey, you were supposed to have five pages done by now...
还包括一个高潮012---...including an exciting incident.
这是什么垃圾  "大火球游戏规则"012---What is all this? "The Official Rulebook of Fireball."
对啊  我们刚在玩这游戏012---Yeah, that's the game we played.
很好玩  道具就是一颗网球  一个碗  可燃液体012---Yeah, it's great. You take a tennis ball, a bowl and lighter fl--
这对你的事业有帮助吗  我还以为你想当演员012---This is helping your career, huh? You wanted to be an actor.
不是发明危险游戏被人告012---Not the creator of Crazy Lawsuit Game.
你说得对  我该工作了012---You're right, you're right. I'll get back to work.
你真不应该  还带坏他  明知道乔伊应该要工作012---And shame on you. You should know better. Joey needs to work.
振作点012---Now come on. Hey.
嘿  不行  等你写完5页才还你012---No, uh-uh. You can have this back when the five pages are done, huh?
我今晚很开心  我也是012---I had a really nice time tonight. So did I.
幸好摩妮卡约我们出来012---I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
我很想请你进去  不过我妹来了住我家012---I'd love to ask you in but my sister's visiting.
她可能睡在沙发上了  你妹妹012---I think she's asleep on the couch. Your sister?
你妹妹睡在沙发上012---Your sister's asleep on the couch?
喔  我上次看到你们一起搭地铁  现在她还睡在你沙发上012---Ah, I saw you with her on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch.
我就猜是你  太好了  你起床了012---Oh, I thought I heard you. Oh, hey, great, you're up.
瑞秋  这是我妹妹克莉丝塔  克莉丝塔  这是瑞秋012---Rachel, my sister Krista. Krista, Rachel.
嗨  很高兴认识你012---Hi. Nice to meet you.
你应该告诉我要带朋友回来  害我穿得邋里邋遢的012---Wish you told me we were having company. I'd have fixed myself.
有差吗  你真恶劣012---Like it would help. You are so bad.
是你  是你012---You are. You are.
是你  是你  是你  是你012---You are. You are. You are. You are!
你完蛋了012---You are so dead. Ha.
我要教训你一顿012---I'm gonna get you. Aah!
很高兴认识你012---Um, it's very nice to meet you.
没有人  没一个人尊重募捐筒012---Nobody. Nobody respects the bucket.
大家都丢些莫名其妙的东西012---You wouldn't believe what people put in here.
你觉得这像012---Look. Okay, does this look like...
垃圾桶吗  不像012---...a garbage can to you? No.
像烟灰缸吗  不像012---Does it look like an ashtray? No.
像尿桶吗012---Does it look like a urinal?
呀哦012---Ew!
菲比  你还要回去募捐吗  当然  不过我受够了012---So, Pheebs, you gonna go back out there? Yeah, but I'm not gonna take any more crap.
再也不当募捐好好小姐012---Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
加油  你在街上流浪过  够强悍啊012---Yeah, good for you. You're tough. You lived on the street.
我要当回强悍菲比012---Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe.
不过  也不能全当回去012---Yeah. Oh, but you know what? I can't go totally back...
因为  强悍菲比才不会鸟你们012---...because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys.
嘿012---Hey. Hey.
可以问个问题吗  当然012---Um, can I ask you guys something? Sure.
我没有兄弟  实在不了解  不过你们会打来打去吗012---Urn, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but did you guys wrestle?
当然会  常常啊012---Oh, yeah. All the time.
而且  我从没输过012---In fact, I was undefeated.
因为你以前90多公斤012---Well, you weighed 200 pounds.
不过我还是跟猫咪一样矫捷012---Still, I was quick as a cat.
我昨天遇到丹尼的妹妹012---Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday.
就是跟他一起搭地铁的那个  真的假的012---Uh, that was the girl on the subway. Oh, you're kidding.
他们非常012---And they were very, you know...
会扭打012---...wrestle-y.
这样正常吗012---But I guess that's normal?
我们现在不会这样了012---We don't wrestle now.
我长大变得强壮后就不打了012---Not since I got too strong for you. Ha, ha.
长大变壮  对012---Too strong for me? Yeah.
你要比划一下吗012---You wanna go right now?
我可以立刻打败你  信不信012---Because I'll take you right now, buddy. You wanna go?
没问题012---Oh, fine.
预备012---Ready?
开始012---Wrestle!
这个嘛  很好012---Okay, you know what, um?
谢谢你们  帮了大忙012---Actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
赶快走  20分后球赛就要开打了  乔伊  快点012---Guys, come on, let's go. The puck drops in 20 minutes. Come on. Joey.
乔伊不能去  我还没写完5页012---Joey's not going. I didn't finish my five pages.
明天再写不就成了012---Why can't you finish them tomorrow?
因为他明天要修改昨天的5页012---Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
我昨天写的有所改进012---Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
别再逼他  让他透口气  搞不好会写得更好012---Why don't you cut him a little slack? Maybe if he relaxes, he'll get some work done.
他已经透够多气了  这都要感谢你012---I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you...
跟大火球012---...and Fireball.
玩大火球可是很紧张  显然你没玩过012---If you think Fireball's relaxing, you obviously have never played.
你拼命压榨乔伊  是因为你太无聊了012---The only reason you're doing this to Joey is you're bored.
又不是乔伊害你失业的012---It's not his fault that you're unemployed.
我不是失业  只是进修中012---I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.
伙计们  你们别吵架012---Look, look. Guys, don't fight.
我之所以这么做  是因为我是乔伊的朋友012---And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend.
如果你也是他好友  就该跟我一样012---And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
当好友就得这么混帐012---So being a good friend means acting like a jerk?
要是真如你所说  你可真是我第一号好友012---If it does, then you're an amazing friend of mine.
别吵了  何不大家玩场大火球  尽弃前嫌012---Hey, guys. How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball, huh?
我去拆掉防火警铃  何不现在就一了百了012---I'll go unhook the smoke detectors. How about we settle this right now?
好了  谁也不准去看球赛012---There. Now no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha.
门票是我买的  才怪012---I paid for those tickets. No, you didn't.
你每次都说要付钱  却一次也没吐过钱  也对012---You said you would, but you never did. Oh, yeah.
我们终于爬到山顶012---So we finally get to the top of the mountain, ahem...
结果这个笨蛋竟然忘了相机012---...and airhead here forgets the camera.
我也发生过这种事情012---You know, that same thing happened to me one time.
什么时候012---When did that happen to you?
记不记得  上次我们不是到公园慢跑  看到那只可爱小鸟012---Don't you remember? We were jogging in the park, we saw that pretty bird.
结果想拍  我竟然没带相机012---And I wanted to take a picture but I didn't have my camera.
也对  不过追小贩可不算慢跑012---Okay. First of all, chasing the churro guy is not jogging.
超好吃  你一定要吃一口012---Oh, this is so good. You have got to try it.
真不错012---That is good.
糟糕  裤子沾到了  我来擦012---Oh, damn. I got it on my pants. Here, I'll get it.
最好上楼换件裤子 否则以后洗不掉012---We better take these off or that stain will set.
而且我今晚约会还要穿  喔  真好012---I wanna wear these pants on our date tonight. Oh, great.
再见  老天爷啊012---Okay, bye. Oh, my God.
不可思议  看吧  我早说过了012---That was unbelievable. Okay, see? I told you.
可怜的瑞秋  我不相信他们是兄妹012---Yeah, wow. Sorry, Rash. I don't believe they're brother and sister.
他们是兄妹012---They're brother and sister?
等一下  手张开  让我检查012---Wait a minute. Open your hand. Let me take a look.
两毛五  一毛  线头不要012---Quarter, dime. Lint? Not interested in that.
这是什么  加拿大硬币  滚蛋012---What's this? A Canadian coin? Get out of here!
天啊012---Gosh.
不准在募捐筒旁边喝东西012---Whoa. No drinks near the bucket.
先放在那边  才准捐款012---Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution.
少装一副可怜兮兮的样子012---And you can leave the "hurt bunny" look over there too.
嗨  鲍柏  不是叫你滚蛋了吗012---Hi, Bob. I thought I told you to get out of here!
菲比  我们接到申诉012---Uh, Phoebe, we've been getting complaints.
上面要调你离开012---And we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
什么012---What?
以后这里由金洁负责  这小妞才没这能耐012---Uh, Ginger's gonna take over this corner. That chick can't handle my corner.
你不走  我们就得赶你走012---Look, either you leave or we remove you.
好012---Fine.
劝你一句  注意那个臭婆娘012---All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
瑞秋  不是约的7点吗  我看  今天就算了012---Oh, hey, Rach. I thought we said 7. Yeah, uh, you know what? Uh, let's skip it.
什么  为什么012---What? Uh, why?
你看012---Um... Look.
你们兄妹似乎  非常要好012---You and your sister seem to have, um, a very special bond--
太好了  又说这句话012---Oh, great. That "special bond" again.
我跟我妹感情好  又是哪里让人看不顺眼了012---Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
听我说  我不知道事实真相  你有兄弟吗012---Okay, look, I don't know, but-Do you have brothers?
没有  我有两个姊姊  其中一个很像男人婆012---No, I have two sisters, but one of them actually has a very masculine energy.
你们要好吗  不  她们不是好人012---Are you close with them? No, no. They're not very nice people.
好  过来  听着012---Okay, come here. Listen.
我真的很喜欢你  交往下去应该会有结果012---I really like you, okay? I think this could go somewhere.
我是跟家人感情深厚  你就为了这点拒绝我012---So what if I'm close to my family? You gonna let that stand in the way of us?
我也不知道012---Well, I-I don't know...

或许你应该让自己别那么八卦012---Hey, Rach, maybe your resolution should be to, urn, gossip less.
我哪有那么八卦012---What? I don't gossip.
或许我偶尔会发现一些事012---Maybe sometimes I find out things.
或听到一些事  然后转述出去012---Or I hear something and I pass that information on.
当做一种服务012---You know, kind of like a public service.

所以  这是"熊爪"012---So then, this is "Bear Claw."
"火鸡脚"012---Okay, "Turkey Leg"...

我想的不是这个012---Not what I had in mind.
罗斯这种人通常不穿这种裤子012---See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants.
因为  这种裤子很紧012---You see, they're very tight.

那又怎样  我又没碰吉他012---What? I didn't touch a guitar.

漂亮012---Nice.
不是  我觉得穿皮裤太热  就进来脱掉012---No, I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off.
结果它一定是遇汗缩水了012---But they must have shrunk from the sweat or something.

什么颜色012---Uh, what color is it?
什么颜色有差别吗012---What difference does that make?
如果跟裤子的颜色一样  你就糊一条假裤子012---Well, if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself paste pants...

我保证  在你说可以之前  绝对不碰吉他012---And I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.

才第二天  我就成了012---Well, it's only the second day, and I'm a loser...
穿不合身皮裤的衰人012---...with stupid leather pants that don't even fit.

班画了你的画像012---Ben drew a picture of you.
你是牛仔喔012---Huh? You're a cowboy.
因为我穿皮裤012---Because of the leather pants?
班并不觉得你衰  他觉得你是牛仔012---Ben doesn't think you're a loser. He thinks you're a cowboy.
很棒吧012---I mean, that's something.
真的很棒  牛仔哥012---It really is something. Howdy, partner. Hey.
也许我应该再去买一条012---Maybe I should get another pair.

我去跟班说晚安012---I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.
他居然觉得我是牛仔012---I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
我会是个好牛仔012---I would make a good cowboy.
好  既然没事  我要去洗衣服了012---Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I'm gonna go do my laundry.

祝你好运  再见012---Good luck, honey. Bye.
乔伊  记得我要给你说的那件大事吗012---Hey, uh, Joey, remember that big thing I was going to tell you about?
我不会告诉你  但如果你自己发现012---I'm not gonna tell you. But if you found out on your own...
那就没关系了  我们就可以讨论了  对吧012---...that would be okay, and then we could talk about it, right?
那样就不是秘密  的确没关系012---Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So, yeah, that would be okay. Yeah, yeah.
嘿  乔伊  你去钱德的房间012---Hey, Joe, would you mind going over into Chandler's bedroom...

我或许知道了  我也是012---I might know something. I might too something too.
你知道了什么  你先说我才能说012---What's the thing you know? You tell me what you know.
我不能说  那我也不能说012---I can't tell you. Then I can't.
那好吧012---Okay, fine.
你才不知道012---You don't know.
不如我现在就去钱德的房间  就可以知道012---How about I go there and walk into Chandler's bedroom and see the thing...

摩妮卡和钱德搞在一起了  又怎么样012---It's not that big a deal. So Monica and Chandler are doing it.
你居然这么说012---I cannot believe you would say that!
抱歉  摩妮卡和钱德在"做爱"012---Sorry. Monica and Chandler are "making love."
不是啦  我是说这是大事啊012---No, I mean, come on. This is a huge deal!

我有个办法  你就这么想012---You know what might help deal with it? Think of it this way.
你和艾蜜莉已经过去了  你不能对过去的事生气012---You and Emily are in the past. You can't be mad about the past.
你还气我们跟法国买土地吗012---Are you still mad about, you know, the Louisiana Purchase?
没有人在气那个  没错  因为已经过去了012---I don't think anybody's mad about that. Exactly! Because it's in the past.

脱衣舞教堂012---Strip church.
我要去找支球拍  你不是有支012---Anyway, I'm gonna go try to find a racket. I thought you had one.
本来有  后来被乔伊拿去中央公园对着大石头打012---I used to, but then Joey thought it'd be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks...
大石头012---...at bigger rocks.
瑞秋  你有网球拍吗  嘿012---Hey, Rach, do you have a tennis racket? Hey.
我借给乔伊  就没拿回来过012---Oh, um, I lent it to Joey and I've never gotten it back.
祝你好运012---Okay, good luck with that.
嘿  嘿012---Ahem. Hey. Hey.
你好吗012---What's up?
你怎么来了  今天不是要盘点吗012---What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
没错  但我决定午休久一点012---Well I do, but I decided I'd take a long lunch...
陪陪我的朋友摩妮卡012---...and spend some time with my friend, Monica.
我们现在都不谈心了012---You know, I feel like we don't talk anymore.
你好吗012---How are you?
有什么新变化012---What is new with you?
变化不多  工作很顺利012---Not much. Um, work's good.
我们不必聊工作嘛  什么都可以聊012---We don't have to talk about work. We could talk about anything.
好吧012---Okay. Um...
这样吧012---Hey! You know what?
我们来聊感情012---Let's talk about relationships.
好  你最近怎样  没人追012---Okay. What's going on with you? Nothing.
该你了012---You go.
我原本觉得银行有一个人很帅012---Well, I... There was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute.
现在不觉得了012---Um, but I don't anymore.
真精彩012---Wow, that's, uh, juicy. Ahem, um...
不过  我确实很忙012---You know what? I actually do have a lot of work to do.
你确定没别的了012---You're sure there's just not anything else?
确定啊  你有什么事想说吗012---Yes, I'm sure. Is there something you want to talk to me about?
没有012---No.
我012---I...

谢了012---Actually, thanks!
可以去看电影了吗012---All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
我想我不去了012---Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
你不去  对  我要留下来看书012---Really? I'm gonna stay and read my book.
我现在只想静一静012---I just want to be alone right now.
你真的不去012---Oh. Sure you don't want to come?
汤姆汉克斯  梅格莱恩  写信什么的012---Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan. They get mail and stuff.
我还是不去了  好吧012---That's okay, Joe. All right.
菲比  我们走012---Let's go, Pheebs.

你还好吗012---Are you all right?
我们喝口水012---We'll just get a little sip of water.
我今天很猛吧012---Am I on fire today or what?
那两只肉鸡已经烤好了  等着被切来吃了012---Those birds are browned, basted and ready to be carved.
别激动  网球名将012---Okay, easy, Martina.
我觉得下一场应该让他们赢012---I think we should let them win the next game.
对不起  你刚说的话我听不懂012---I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
让他们赢一场012---Let them win one.
你疯了吗  他们任我们宰割  你看他们012---Are you crazy? We own those two. Look at them!
他喘不过气来  她在吃药012---He can't even breathe, and she's popping pills.
你根本不给他们机会012---You're not giving them a chance.
他们有球拍  不是吗012---They have rackets, don't they?
宾  我想打完这场就收了012---Uh, Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
了解  我求之不得012---Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.
你真的没打过职业012---Are you sure you never played pro? Ha-ha-ha.
拜托让他们赢012---Please let them win.
我顶多只能把战斗力降到95%012---I'll take it down to 95 percent, but that's the best I can do.
糟糕  漏掉了  我来012---Oopsie! Missed it! I got it!
好球012---Nice shot.
我来012---I got it!
出界012---Long!
你居然让他们赢012---I can't believe you let them win.
至少你把不爽掩饰得很好012---Yeah, well, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
我很沮丧  这是我的球拍012---I was frustrated. It was my racket.
是你让我沮丧012---I was frustrated with you!
如果没输那场球  他们也不会找我们去吃饭012---If we hadn't lost, they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow.
我最困扰的是012---What bothers me...
你在他们身边整个人都变了012---...is how different you act around them.
故意输球  工作笑012---The throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh...
"回头见  宾"  "不回头就不见"012---...the "See you later, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"
我告诉你  我不喜欢"工作的钱德"  那家伙是个狗腿012---I gotta tell you, I don't like "work Chandler." The guy's a suck-up.
因为你这些话012---You know what? Because you said that...
我晚上不跟你玩了012---...I'm not putting out tonight!
绝对有问题  我哥从来不彻夜不归012---I'm telling you,Something's wrong. My brother does not stay out all night.
也许应该去看看垃圾槽012---Maybe we should check the trash chute.
罗斯挤不进垃圾槽012---Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
没错  就差那么一点点012---That's right. He almost could.
所以我之前卡住过012---Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
天哪012---Oh, my God!
你死哪去了012---Where the hell have you been?
就是去外面了012---Just, you know, out.
外面  天哪  我们怎么没去那里找012---Oh, out! God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there.
你都在做什么012---What were you doing?
我先去喝酒  然后012---I, uh, went to a bar and then...
就晃了一下012---...I just, uh, walked around for a while.
你整夜一个人在外面乱晃012---You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
他嘿咻了012---He hooked up!
他跟某人嘿咻了012---He hooked up with someone.

我还年轻  我有需求  我不能等一辈子012---I'm a young woman. I have needs. I can't wait forever.
我也是这么想的012---Yeah, no, that's what I was thinking.
所以我求求你们  在批评我之前先想一下012---So I'm asking you, please just take a moment before you judge me.
没有人在批评你012---Oh, nobody's judging you.
喔012---Oh.
好  你  天时地利人和先生012---Okay, you, Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

我不知道你会说那个012---I didn't know you'd say that.
罗斯  珍妮丝012---Ross! Janice?

他是我们的朋友  他显然是疯了012---He's our friend. He obviously went crazy.
脑筋秀逗了012---He obviously lost his mind.
没那么夸张  好吗  珍妮丝和我有很多共同点012---I didn't lose my mind, okay? Janice and I have a lot in common.
我们都离过婚  我们都有小孩012---We've both been divorced. We both have kids.
你真的要再见她012---Are you actually going to see her again?
别影响他  我确实要再见她012---Don't put ideas in his head! I am gonna see her again.
你看啦  菲比012---Damn it, Phoebe!
我要说出一件我没坦承过的事012---Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship
高中时我知道你喜欢詹姆法洛  但我还是跟他上了床012---But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!
哇  说出来的感觉真好  好  该你了012---Wow! That feels so good to get off my chest. Okay, you go.
该我了  什么意思012---My turn? What are you talking about? Ugh.
摩妮卡012---Monica...
我知道你和钱德的事012---I know about you and Chandler.

我那天听到你们在讲电话012---I overheard you on the phone the other day.
你说 "我会告诉瑞秋  我要花两个小时洗衣服"012---You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."
他说 "洗衣服  那是我的新绰号吗"012---And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"
然后你说 "不是012---And you said, "No.
你明知你的绰号是大鹏"012---You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
这个嘛012---Well, heh...
原来你正在写剧本012---Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there, Rach.
记得把结局告诉我012---Wow, I... Let me know how that one turns out.
我不知道  因为我吓到了  把电话挂掉了012---I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out I hung up the phone.
如果你听完012---Well, if you had kept listening, ha-ha-ha...
你会听到  我是叫他大012---...you would have heard me call him Mister Big...
碉堡  什么012---...ot. What?

你们好  嗯012---Hey, guys. Yeah.
说也奇怪  我今天跟珍妮丝过得很开心012---It's so weird to say this, but I just had a great date with Janice.
什么  真的假的012---What? Are you serious?
没错  我跟她诉说近来的惨事012---Yeah. I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me.
我说了好几个小时012---I mean, I talked for hours.
有人专心012---It is amazing...
听你倾诉的感觉真好012---...to have someone give you such focused attention.
那你何必找她  你有我们012---You don't need Janice for that. You've got us.
鸭子找到花生酱饼干了  不012---And the duck gets the Nutter Butter! No! Agh!

你们的咖啡要怎么上012---So how do you like your coffee?
我不要  谢谢  我要点点糖012---None for me. Just a little bit of sugar.
那就让摩妮卡把指头伸进去012---Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it.
应该就会甜了012---That ought to sweeten it up.
你那样笑怎么不会头痛  久了就习惯了012---How does that laugh not give you a headache? You get used to it.
我不觉得我会习惯012---I don't think that I can.
我以后就不甩这套了012---So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
老板说笑我就笑  这又有什么呢012---So I laugh at my boss's jokes. What's the big deal?
如果能跟我尊敬的男友在一起012---I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy
我干嘛陪一个没尊严的马屁精012---...when I could be hanging out  with my boyfriend, who I actually respect.
嗯012---Oh.
我得为卡拉煮的咖啡道歉012---Ah, heh.I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee.
如果它去打架012---I'd feel sorry for it if it got in a fight.
连自己都保护不了012---It's not strong enough to defend itself. Ha-ha-ha!
你听到我的话了吗012---Did you hear what I said Bing?
什么012---What?
那个笑话啊  你是怎么了012---It's a joke, Bing. What's the matter with you?
我只是觉得不好笑012---Well, I just didn't think it was funny, sir.
你说什么012---Excuse me?
我只是  亲爱的012---Well, I just... Honey?
我觉得你没听懂012---I just don't think you understood the joke.
是吗  是啊012---Really? Yeah.
很好笑嘛  你一定是没听懂012---I mean, it was really funny. I just don't think that you got it.
卡拉煮的咖啡很稀012---Heh, you see, Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.
但道格是在暗示它很虚弱012---But what Doug did was imply that it was weak physically.
现在你懂了吗  我懂了012---You get it now, honey? I think I do!
谢谢你  莫尼卡  我觉得你需要解释012---Thank you, Monica. I thought you could use the help.
咖啡打架012---Coffee in a fight!
瑞秋012---Hey, Rach.
我可以在这里看漫画吗012---You mind if I read my comic books in here?
当然可以  怎么了012---Sure. Why?
钱德和摩妮卡在一起  我很难专心012---Chandler and Monica are over there. It's kind of hard to concentrate.
什么  她刚打来说她要加班012---What? She just called and said she was going to be working late.
她一直骗我012---She keeps lying to me.
够了  我现在就过去  揭穿他们012---That's it! I'm gonna go over there and I'm confronting them right now.
所以我得讲碉堡的笑话012---So you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?
对不起  我不太会圆谎012---I'm just not very good at this.
我很不会骗人  我又很讨厌骗瑞秋012---I'm a terrible liar. I hate having to lie to Rachel.
但我们还不能公开  我知道012---But we're not ready to tell yet. I know.
只是从高中起  我什么事都告诉瑞秋012---Ever since high school, Rachel was the one person that I told everything to.
我好怀念那种感觉012---I miss that so much now.
她是我最要好的朋友012---She's my best friend.
乔伊012---Joey?
天哪  瑞秋  嘿012---Oh, my God, Rachel! Hey!
嗨012---Hi!
你怎么跑来这里012---What are you doing here?
这个嘛  我是来借这盏灯012---Well, I actually came over here to borrow this lamp...
好看书012---...to, um, look at my books.
看得清楚一点012---You know, see them a little better. Heh.
太好了  是啊012---Okay, great. Great. Um... Yeah.
我在钱德的房间里是因为012---Well, what I was doing in Chandler's room is that, um...
我在帮忙打扫012---...I was cleaning it.
实际上  是他付钱请我打扫  是喔012---In fact, he pays me to clean it. Oh!
真是个赚零用钱的好办法012---What a great way to make some extra pocket money.
之前我说要加班012---When I said to you earlier that I was at work, um...
就是指我的这个新工作012---...I'm at my new work.
真不错  对吧012---Good enough. Right?
好  那012---Okay, well, um...
我要去看书了012---I'm gonna go look at my books.
好  我得去忙我的新工作了  好012---Okay. Go get back to my new job. Okay.
好012---Okay.
恭喜你找到这份工作012---Congratulations on your new job!
天哪  她可真好骗012---Man, she is really gullible.
你们的咖啡  谢谢012---Here you go. Thanks.
其实  我该走了  你确定012---Actually, I should get going. You're sure?
你想留多晚我都奉陪012---I can stay out as late as you want.
我说过我为什么休长假吧012---I told you I'm on sabbatical from work...
对  你说过012---Yes, yes. You did. Ha-ha-ha.
真是的  又怎么了012---Oh, man! What is wrong now?
我不是点这个012---This isn't what I ordered.
我的人生就不能顺利一点吗012---Man! Can't anything go right in my life?
先是我的婚姻破裂  然后012---First, my marriage falls apart, and then...
我知道  我知道012---I know, I know!
然后你被赶出你家  工作没了012---You lose your apartment, then you lose your job...
你的前妻很快就再婚了  现在咖啡又错了012---...then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee!
罗斯012---Ross...
我们得谈谈  好啊012---...we need to talk. Okay.
有时我觉得  不012---Sometimes I feel... No, no, don't.
是我要说012---I'm going to talk.
我认为012---I believe...
我们的美好时光012---...that the sun has set...
已经落日了012---...on our day in the sun.
什么  你是个很好的人012---What? You're a very sweet person, Ross.
但是012---Unfortunately...
我没办法再听到你继续哀下去了012---...I just don't think I can take another second of you whining!
我跟你确认一下012---Let me make sure I'm hearing this right.
你要跟我结束  因为012---You're ending this with me because...
我太会发牢骚012---...I'm too whiny?
你是说012---So you're saying...
我是这么的爱发牢骚012---...I've become so whiny...
我让你012---...that I...
珍妮丝012---...annoy you...
觉得很烦012---...Janice.
没错012---Well, yeah!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
你不要紧吧  现在不要紧了012---Are you gonna be okay? I am now.
好吧012---Okay.

希望不会太奇怪012---I hope this isn't too weird but, uh...
我最近跟珍妮丝交往过012---...I had a thing with Janice.
你不生气012---You're not mad?
我干嘛生气012---Why would I be mad?
因为这种事有它的道义在012---Because there's certain rules about this kind of stuff.
不能追朋友的旧情人012---You don't, uh... You don't fool around with your friends' ex-girlfriends...
或是012---...or, uh...
心上人  或是有亲属关系的人012---...possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
我很生气012---I am mad.
但是你知道吗  我要原谅你012---But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you.
因为那样才叫兄弟012---Because that's what friends do.
他们会原谅朋友  犯了你念的012---They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said.
那串禁忌  谢了012---All the things on the list there. Thank you.
但是我要你记住012---But I want you to remember...
我原谅了你012---...that I forgave you.

要是你记不住012---If you can't remember that...
我们应该写  我们写下来吧012---...I think we should write it down. Let's write it down!
我们居然没试过  真舒服012---Ah, I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good!
摩妮卡好舒服012---So good for Monica!
时间到  该我了012---Oh! Look at that, Time's up! My turn.
已经半小时了  计时器是你的012---That was half an hour? It's your timer.
好  好吧012---Okay. All right.
我不想自夸  但我最会按摩了012---I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages.
好啊  那就给我按下去吧012---All right, then massage me up right nice!
很舒服吧012---It's so good, isn't it?
太舒服了  我觉得我都无福消受了012---It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
跟瘦痛肌肉说再见吧012---Say goodbye to sore muscles!
肌肉  再见012---Goodbye, muscles!

她的按摩技术烂的不行啊012---She gives the worst massages ever.
感觉就像她在拷问我012---It was like she was torturing me for information.
我很想招  又不知道要招什么012---I wanted to give it up. I just didn't know what it was!
要是真的很痛  你应该告诉她012---If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.
我这辈子第一次这么认真012---For the first time in my life, I'm in a real relationship.
我才不要因为说实话而搞砸012---I won't screw that up by telling the truth.
小心012---Dude, look out!
你差点踩扁我的帽子012---You almost crushed my hat.
对不起012---Sorry.
兔子跑走了012---And the bunny got away.
你该解释这顶帽子的事了012---This would be the place where you explain the hat.

去试镜的人012---..everyone at the audition
一定都会穿得很时尚012---is gonna be wearing wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
你要把他们都变不见012---And you'll make them disappear?
有什么比这顶帽子更有品味012---Like you could find something this sophisticated.
搞定012---Done!
乔伊  你想好看  可以来找我选衣服012---Joey，If you want to look good, why don't you just come down to the store?  I'll help you out.
谢谢  不客气012---Great! Thanks! Sure.
拜托  快拿掉012---God, please take those off!
菲比  今天好吗012---Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?
还好而已  因为我刚去过医院012---Um, only okay. Because I just got back from the hospital.
你还好吗012---Are you all right?
我很好  但是我外婆死了012---I'm fine. But, uh, my grandma sort of died.
菲比  真抱歉  没关系012---Pheebs, sorry. It's okay.
她这一生过得很精彩012---She had a really incredible life.
我也不是永远见不到她  她会来找我012---It's not like I won't see her again. y'know she's gonna visit.
也许她现在就在这里012---Well maybe, Maybe she's with us right now.
是啊  第一天进入到新世界  结果就跑来咖啡馆012---Right. her first day on a new spiritual plane and she'll come to the coffeehouse.
外面车上有两个人在嘿咻012---Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside!
菲比的外婆刚过世012---Uh, Pheebs' grandmother just died.
天哪  对不起012---Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
没关系  其实这样还蛮酷的012---It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kind of cool. 'Cause it's like ...
一个生命结束  另一个生命诞生012---...you know, one life ends and another begins.
他们的做法很难012---Not the way they're doing it.
怎么回事  她是怎么过世的012---What, What happened? How did she die?
我们在超市012---We were in the market...
她弯腰去拿优格  就再也没起来过012---...and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
菲比  真令人遗憾012---Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
她最后说的话倒很窝心012---It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was:
〝你去拿蛋  我拿优格  我们在出口见〞012---"Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter"
你们知道吗012---You know what?
我们绝对会在人生的出口见012---We will meet at the checkout counter.
乔伊  衣服得归还012---Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff.
所以你得穿内裤012---right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
好  那你还得拿内裤给我012---All right. You'd better show me some of that too then..
还少了点什么012---It's missing something.
我知道了  好012---Oh, I know. Um, okay.
真的  皮包啊012---Really? A purse?
这不是皮包  是手提包012---It's not a purse. It's a shoulder bag.
很像女人的皮包  不012---It looks like a woman's purse. No.
相信我  春季T型台上的男模都在背012---Trust me, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog.
你看  男人背包包012---See, look. Men carrying the bag.
你看  女人背包包012---See, look. Women carrying the bag.
我一个男人背女用皮包  居然很帅012---But it is odd how a woman's purse looks so good on me, a man.
没错  男女通用012---Exactly. Unisex!
你或许需要  我2天前刚做过012---Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.

很多人012---Lots of people!
你到底要不要来012--- Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
不要012---Um, no.
我以为她已经死了  我已经接受这个事实了012---See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it.

我给你带了些花012---I brought you flowers.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks!
这样感觉有男人味多了012---Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
对不起  打扰下  请问告别式是在这里吗012---I'm sorry. Excuse me, is this the, uh, memorial?
欢迎012---Welcome.
这是你的3D眼镜012---Here's your 3-D glasses.

是吗  尊姓大名012---Really?! What's your name?
法兰克布非012---Frank Buffay.

怎么了012---What happened?
那是我爸012---That was my dad.
天哪  你们看012---Oh, my God! What? Check it out!
我的手好像正朝着我来012---It's like it's coming right at me.
追到他了吗  他怎么说012---Did you catch him? What did he say?
他说〝很高兴认识你  葛兰达〞012---He said, um, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."
我当然不能说出真名012---Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
为什么012---Why? Why not?
你们也看到  他走得像飞了一样012---Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!
想什么呢  难道他会留下来  跟他抛弃的女儿聊天012---What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
那你怎么说012---What did you say to him?
我自称法兰西丝的遗嘱执行人  有事找他谈012---Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so
我们待会约在咖啡馆012---I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
请各位就座012---Could everyone take their seats?
我现在没办法想这个012---I just can't think about that now.
我只想跟我外婆道别  好012---I want to say goodbye to my grandma. Okay.
走吧012---Let's go say goodbye.
我要去面试了  怎么样012---I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
帅呆了  那个包包会让你被选上012---I think you look great! Joey.That bag is gonna get you that part.
还能钓到男人012---And a date with a man.
随你怎么取笑我  这个包包很棒012---You know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag.
而且是好看又好用012---And it's as handy as it is becoming.
你们不懂  不代表是错的012---Now, Just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong.
以后你们都得习惯  有乔伊012---All right, So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey
就有包包012---...comes with a bag!
我也该走了  我得去见我爸012---All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
菲比  你去了会说什么  会表明你的身份吗012---Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
先不会表明  我不想吓跑他012---Not at first. I don't want to freak him out.
但是你不气他吗012---But aren't you pissed at him?
这家伙遗弃了你012---This guy abandoned you.
如果是我  他就等着挨揍吧012---I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!
我会走进去说 〝喂  老爸012---I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad!!
我们  现在  就出去解决〞012---You and me, outside. Right now!"
我都吓到自己了012---I kinda scared myself.
那起码有吓到人012---Well, at least you scared someone.
说来也奇怪  我应该很生气啊012---Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry.
我的意思是  我应该很想扭断他那颗头012---I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off.
幸好  我已经释怀了012---Fortunately, I'm past it.
你看起来的确有点紧绷绷  我帮你捏捏012---You do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
放开我012---Oh, get off! Ow!
住手  你为什么这样整我012---Stop it! Why are you doing that to me?
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
身为一个按摩师和一个人类012---As a masseuse and a human...
我恳求你  永远别帮别人按摩012---...I'm begging you, never do that to anyone.
我很会按摩啊012---I give good massages.
我以前都帮瑞秋按摩  是她后来会过敏012---I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic!
钱德也很喜欢  你看012---And Chandler, he loves them! Watch.
他才不喜欢  他痛得快要死了012---He does not like it. He's in pain!
他才没有  他有012---No, he's not. Yes, he is!
什么  对不起  但是012---What? I'm sorry but, ow!
你一直在骗我012---You've been lying to me?
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe you'd do that.
也许他只是不希望你难过012---Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings..
但我们一旦开始欺骗对方012---But the minute we start to lie to each other...
我说的〝我们〞012---And by "we"...
指的是社会012---...I mean society.
你好了就开始012---Anytime you're ready.
你一定是新来的012---Ahem, well, you must be new here.
我们找张桌子  我请你喝一杯012---Maybe we get a table, I buy you a drink.
抱歉  你能不能不背皮包啊012---I'm sorry, Could you try it without the purse?
当然  可以012---Yeah, sure.
你一定是新来的  我们找张012---Ahem, well, you must be new here. Maybe we sit...
我可以问件事吗  可以  什么事012---I'm sorry, Can I ask you something? Sure. What?
第一   这不是皮包012---Well, first, it's not a purse.
好012---Okay...
再来012---Anytime.
别以为这是女用皮包012---If you think it's a woman's bag, it's not.
这是男用提包012---It's a man's bag.
好的  继续吧012---Okay. And go.
我拿目录给你看012---Let me show you the catalog.
你看012---Look. See?
这是最新流行012---Huh? It's the latest thing.
每个人都有  男人  女人  小孩都在背012---Everyone's got one. Men, women, children. Everyone's carrying them!
你在推销这些包包吗012---Do you sell these bags?
不是  这些包包摆着就能卖012---No, these babies sell themselves.
好  谢谢  你表现得很好012---Thank you. That was great.
我什么都还没念012---But I didn't read anything.
这样就够了012---I think we've seen enough.
那好  再见012---All right, I'll see you.
搞定了  搞定了012---We got it. We got it.
瑞秋在吗  不在012---Is Rachel here? No.
听我说  我想为下午和按摩的事道歉012---Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing.
我很喜欢你的按摩012---I really like them.
别再硬撑了012---Please stop.
我们都应该坦诚相对012---we're supposed to be honest with each other
我只希望你能明白告诉我 〝我不喜欢你的按摩〞012---I-I just wish you could tell me―just say, "I don't like your massages."
我不喜欢你的按摩012---I don't like your massages.
看吧  又没什么大不了的012---See? It's no big deal.
但是你哭了012---But now you're crying.
我不是在哭这个  我是在哭工作的事012---I'm not crying about that. I'm crying about something at work.
我男朋友说他不喜欢我的按摩012---My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
你又不必事事都抢第一012---You don't have to be best at everything.
天哪  你一点也不了解我012---Oh, my God! You don't know me at all!
好012---Okay...
你的按摩技术天下第一烂012---You give the worst massages in the world.
我在哭啊012---I'm crying here!
听我说完012---Look, hear me out.
比烂的话  你最棒012---You give the best bad massages.
如果有人在找最棒的烂按摩012---If anybody was looking for the best bad massage...
他们自问 〝谁的技术最棒 〞012---and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?"
那绝对非你莫属012---They'd have to go to you.
你的意思是  如果有最佳012---So you're saying that if there was an award...
烂按摩技术奖  那谁会得奖012---...for the best bad massage... Who would get that?
一定是你012---It would be you!
你  摩妮卡  你会大获全胜012---You, Monica! And you'd get all the votes.
或许这个奖可以叫摩妮卡奖012---So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
一定会的012---Absolutely.
好012---Okay...
我烂透了012---I suck!
谢谢你来见我012---Thank you for meeting with me.
谢谢012---Thank you.
这边坐012---Come sit.
坐啊012---Sit.
坐012---Sit!
好的  在开始之前  你必须012---Um, alrighty. Um, before we get started, I need you...
郑重声明  你其实是法兰克布非012---...to state for the official record that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.
是的  我是012---Yes, I am. Mm-hm.
好  法兰西丝留给我什么了012---Okay. So, what did Frances leave me?
这是你找我来的原因吧012---Huh? That's why you wanted me to come.
是的012---Oh, yes.
的确有  她留给你012---Yes, she did. She left you, um...
这支口红012---...this lipstick.
这真是  这是用过的012---Oh, it's, ew, used.
酷012---Uh, cool.
好  我要请教几个问题  我把相关表格拿出来012---Okey. I have just a few questions to ask, so I'll get out my official forms.
好  第一个问题012---So question one:
你娶了法兰西丝的女儿莉莉  正不正确012---You were married to Frances' daughter, Lilly. is that correct?
对  没错012---Yes, I was.
好  第二个问题  这段婚姻012---Okay, um, question two: Um, did that marriage end...
一  很美满012---...A, happily...
二  普通012---...B, medium...
或是三  你最后012---...or, C, in the total abandonment...
抛妻弃子012---...of her and her two children?
表上真的这么写012---It really says that?
对  你看012---Yeah, see?
那我就得选三了012---I guess then I would have to say C.
抛妻弃子012---Total abandonment.
抛弃的原因012---Reasons for abandonment:
一  极机密政府工作012---Um, A, top secret government work...
二  失忆症012---...B, amnesia...
或是三 你就是个自私不负责的012---...or, C, you're just a selfish, irresponsible...
大坏蛋012---...bad, bad man.
其实  我没那么想要这支口红012---Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much.
请你帮个忙012---Would you do me a favor?
把这个012---Would you give Lilly...
交给莉莉  什么012---...that, please? What?
你见着莉莉  请把那张纸条交给她012---When you see Lilly, would you give her that, that note?
我本来想在告别式上找她谈  但是012---Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but,
我觉得她也会像你这样发飙  就临阵退缩了012---well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out.
我写了那张纸条  请帮我转交012---So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
你想来找莉莉012---But you came to see Lilly?
对  怎么了012---Yeah. Why?
莉莉死了012---Lilly's dead.
什么012---She what?
她死了012---She's dead.
你确定012---Are you sure?
没死被火化  就严重了012---If she isn't, cremating her was a big mistake.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this. I just can't believe...
怎么会  天哪012---How? Oh, my God.
多久的事012---How long ago?
17年前012---Seventeen years ago.
那女孩们呢012---What about the girls?
乌苏拉在当服务生  住在苏活012---Well, Ursula is a waitress and she lives in Soho.
菲比012---And Phoebe...
就坐在这张沙发上012---...is on this couch.
没错  口红和女儿  真是黄道吉日012---Yep, lipstick and a daughter. Big day for you.
菲比  我012---Phoebe, I, um...
我不知道该说什么012---It's just, I don't know what to say.
你居然是我的女儿  你长得这么漂亮012---I just can't believe that you're my daughter. You're so pretty.
那个跟这个无关012---Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.
如果我说我很抱歉012---Would it make you feel better if I said...
你会不会好过一点012---...that I was very, very sorry I left?
你说什么都没差别了012---Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway,
所以你可以走了012---So you can just go.
我要辩解一下  我很不会当爸爸012---Well, you know, in my defense, I was a lousy father.
这叫辩解   没错012---That's your defense? Yes, it is.
我把牛奶烧焦  把尿布包反012---I burned the formula, and I put your diapers on backwards.
我编了一首歌哄你睡觉  结果你哭得更厉害012---I made up a song to sing you to sleep,, but that made you cry even more.
你会写歌012---You make up songs?
只有那一首  不过很白痴012---Well, no, just that one. But it was stupid.
我想想怎么唱012---Let's see, how did it go? Um...
爱困妹  爱困妹012---Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
你为什么不睡觉012---Why won't you go to sleep?
爱困妹  爱困妹012---Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
你害我不能睡觉012---You're keeping me up
这种事我不太行012---I'm not very good at this.
我很行012---Well, I am.
现在还不行012---Not yet. No.
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  结果如何012---Hey! How'd the audition go?
经纪人说没中012---Estelle said I didn't get it.
什么  怎么可能  你准备得那么充分012---What? Why? Joey, you were so ready for it.
我也这么想012---I thought so too...
但她说选角的人对我有意见012---...but the casting people had problems with me.
什么意见012---What kind of problem?
老实说012---To tell you the truth...
他们不喜欢这个包包  天哪012---...they had a problem with the bag! Oh, my God!
无所谓  反正也是出烂戏012---You know what? It was a stupid play anyway.
你该放弃这个包包了012---It's time to give up the bag.
我不想放弃它012---I don't want to give up the bag.
我不必放弃它  对吧  瑞秋012---I don't have to give it up, do I, Rach?
你觉得我应该放弃012---You think I should give up the bag!
乔伊  对不起  我觉得你背起来很帅012---Joey, I'm sorry. I mean as terrific as I think you are with it ...
但世人或许还没办法接受你们012---...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
你居然这么说012---I can't believe I'm hearing this!
等等  我不是说你不该带包包012---Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag,
但有其他争议性比较小的012---I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm ...
包包012---...controversial.
对  它们叫做皮夹012---Yeah, um, they're called wallets.
你们看  丑裸男在收拾东西012---Oh, hey, you guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy's putting stuff in boxes.
看样子  我们的裸友要搬家了012---Huh. I'd say from the looks of it, our naked buddy is moving.
讽刺的是大部分的箱子  都标示着"衣服"012---Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled "Clothes."
我会怀念那个大屁股的012---Aw, I'm going to miss that big old squishy butt.
鸡肉炒饭吃不下了012---And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
嘿  如果他要搬走  也许我可以去把那里租下来012---Hey. Hey, if he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place.
对啊  好主意012---Oh, yeah. Good idea.
跟你们遥遥相对多好玩啊012---It would be so cool to live across from you guys.
那我们就可以玩电话游戏012---Yeah, hey, then we could do that telephone thing...
你一个罐子  我们一个罐子012---...you know, where you have a can, we have a can...
中间有一条线012---...and it's connected by a string.
或者我们也可以打真的电话012---Or we could do the actual telephone thing.
老友记  第五季  第14集  恍然大悟012---Friends  S05E14  The One Where Everyone Finds Out
天哪  我爱死这间公寓了012---Oh, my God. I love this apartment.
很完美吧012---Isn't it perfect?
我居然没发现这里有这么棒012---I can't believe I never realized how great it is.
因为你的目光会马上移到丑裸男身上012---That is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
太棒了012---It's amazing.
你最好赶快去申请  否则我会抢先012---You better hurry up and fill out an application, or I'll beat you to it.
没想到会有这么一天  我要去用丑裸男的厕所了012---Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
你看  是摩妮卡和钱德  喂012---Oh, look. There's Monica and Chandler. Hey!
喂  你们好  喂012---Hey, you guys! Hey!
钱德和摩妮卡  钱德和摩妮卡012---Aah! Chandler and Monica. Chandler and Monica.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
钱德和摩妮卡  天哪012---Chandler and Monica! Oh, my God!
我要瞎了  我要瞎了012---Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
菲比  菲比  嗯012---Phoebe. Phoebe. Ow!
没事的  没事的012---It's okay. It's okay.
不  他们搞在一起了  我知道012---No, they're doing it! I know.
我知道  我知道  你知道012---I know. I know. You know?
对  我知道  乔伊也知道  但罗斯不知道012---Yes, I know, and Joey knows, but Ross doesn't...
所以你别再叫了012---...so you have to stop screaming!
怎么了012---Hey, what's going on?
怎么了 没事012---What? Nothing.
我们只是好兴奋  你要搬到这里来012---Oh, God, we're just so excited that you might get this apartment.
这里的确很棒  很棒012---Actually, it looks really good. Aah! It looks pretty good!
到这儿来  快过来啊012---Get in here! Come on!
你是说每次摩妮卡和钱德  像这样012---You mean whenever Monica and Chandler were, like...
去洗衣服或买东西012---...doing laundry or going grocery shopping...?
她每次跟伤心的琳达讲电话012---All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp?
嘿咻  嘿咻  色情电话012---Uh-huh. Doing it, doing it, phone doing it.
真不敢相信012---I can't believe it.
我是说  真是太好了  对男方来说012---I mean, I think it's great. For him.
女方可以有更好的对象012---She might be able to do better.
你们好  乔伊  快过来  过来012---Hey, you guys. Joey, come here. Come here.
菲比发现摩妮卡和钱德的事了012---Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
就是说他们是朋友  如此而已012---You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
不  乔伊  她知道了012---No. No, Joey, she knows.
我们刚才在丑裸男的公寓  看到他们隔着窗户在做012---We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and saw them doing it through the window.
应该说是  靠着窗户在做012---Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
他们知道你知道  但是不知道瑞秋知道012---Okay, so now they know you know, and they don't know Rachel knows?
对  但现在这些都不重要了012---Yes, but you know what? It doesn't matter who knows what.
我们有三个人知道  就可以告诉他们了012---Now enough of us know that we could just tell them we know.
我再也不必说谎保密了012---Now all the lying and the secrets will finally be over.
或者我们也可以不告诉他们  自己来找点乐子012---Or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
什么意思012---Well, what do you mean?
譬如每次他们说要洗衣服012---You know, every time they say they're doing laundry...
我们就给他们一堆衣服洗012---...we'll give them laundry to do.
我喜欢  不  不012---Oh, I would enjoy that. No, no, no.
等等  瑞秋  你知道怎么更好玩吗  告诉他们012---Wait, Rach, you know what would be even more fun? Telling them.
不  我想照菲比的做法  我没办法再012---Yeah, no, I want to do Phoebe's thing. I can't take any--
你只要别说我们知道就行了012---You don't have to do anything. Just don't tell them that we know.
不要  我没办法再保密了012---No. I can't take any more secrets.
我有你们的秘密  他们的秘密  还有我自己的秘密012---I got your secrets, I got their secrets. I got secrets of my own, you know.
你才没有秘密  是吗012---You don't have any secrets. Oh, yeah?
你就不知道  我有个企鹅抱枕叫抱宝012---Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
所以012---So, ahem, um...
我们要怎么耍他们012---How are we going to mess with them?
你可以利用室友的身份012---Well, you could use your position，you know,as the roommate.
我就运用我最大的本钱012---And then I would use, you know, the strongest tool at my disposal.
我的性感012---My sexuality.
孩子们  嘿012---Hello, children. Hey.
仔细看  学着点  别吃我的饼干012---Okay. Watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你穿这件外套真好看012---Ooh. Wow, that jacket looks great on you.
是吗  对  这个料子摸起来好软012---Really? Yeah. The material looks so soft.
你好啊  二头肌先生012---Oh, hello, Mr. Bicep.
你在健身吗012---You've been working out?
我在挤牙膏012---Well, I try to, you know, squeeze things.
你还好吗012---Are you okay?
如果你真的想知道012---Well, if you really wanna know--
我不能告诉你012---Oh, I can't tell you this.
菲比  是我  你什么都可以告诉我012---Phoebe, it's me, you can tell me anything.
事实上  我就是不能告诉你012---Well, actually, you're the one person I can't tell this to.
但我又最想告诉你012---And the one person I want to the most.
怎么了012---What's going on?
因为我很久没跟男人在一起了012---I think it's just, you know, that I haven't been with a guy in so long...
有时你一直寻寻觅觅012---...and you know how sometimes you're looking for something...
却没发现他就在你眼前喝咖啡012---...and you don't see that it's right there in front of you, sipping coffee...
我说太多了吗012---Oh, no. Have I said too much?
总之你考虑一下  我就会考虑012---Well, just something to think about. I know I will.
你好可爱012---You are so cute. Heh.
你怎么会这么可爱012---How did you get to be so cute?
我爷爷是瑞典人012---Well, my grandfather was Swedish.
我奶奶其实是只拇指兔012---And my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
你变得更可爱了012---Okay, now you're even cuter.
这简直是今天的民意012---You know, that is a popular opinion today, I must say.
什么012---What?
今天在咖啡厅发生了件怪事012---The weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse.
我觉得菲比在钓我012---I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
是真的  菲比觉得我很有魅力012---I'm telling you, I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
不可能012---It's not possible. Ow.
抱歉  只是在菲比眼中012---I'm sorry, it's just Phoebe's just always thought you were charming...
你的迷人是无性的012---...in a sexless kind of way.
这种话真是百听不厌012---Oh, well, you know, I can't hear that enough.
抱歉  你应该误解她的意思了012---I'm sorry, I just think you misunderstood her.
我没有误解  好吗  她只差没扑上来012---No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me.
她还摸我的二头肌呢012---She touched my bicep, for crying out loud.
这块二头肌012---This bicep?
是  我现在没挤它012---Well, it's not flexed right now.
摩妮卡  你要干什么  要不要一起去看电影012---Hey, Mon, what are you doing? Want to come see a movie with us?
事实上  我正要去洗衣服012---Uh, actually, I was going to do some laundry.
钱德  要不要起去  好啊  我跟你一起去012---Chandler, you want to do it with me? Sure, I'll do it with you.
太好了  等一下012---Okay, great. Hold on a second.
拿去012---Unh. Here you go.
不介意吧  这样我就轻松多了  谢了012---You don't mind, do you? That would really help me out a lot. Thanks.
这样  我的硬币应该不够012---Ha, ha. You know what? I don't think I have enough quarters.
我这里有012---Oh, I have quarters.
嘿  罗斯  公寓申请得怎样012---Hey. Hey, Ross, any word on the apartment yet?
我打过去问  原来丑裸男要自己转租012---Well, I called over there, and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself.
而且已经有一大堆申请者012---And he's already had like 100 applicants.
总之差别是我占了优势012---Oh. No, no, I've got the edge.
我知道这样有点奸诈  但我送了点东西012---I know it's not exactly ethical, but I sent him a bribe...
去贿赂他012---...to tip the scales in my direction.
从窗户搞不好看得到012---Yeah. Check it out, you can see it from the window.
是那个打了蝴蝶结的弹珠台吗012---Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
不是012---No.
那辆新的登山车012---That new mountain bike?
不是012---No.
那你送什么012---Well, what did you send?
一篮小英式松饼012---A basket of mini muffins.
但桌上全都是小英式松饼012---There's a whole table of mini muffin baskets.
哪一篮是你送的012---Which one did you send?
小的那一篮012---The small one.
什么  你真以为那篮松饼  能帮你争取到公寓012---What? You actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
对012---Well, yeah.
我们办公室曾经收到一篮  大家都爱得不得了012---Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those muffins.
那天真的很高兴012---It was the best day.
你的工作让我觉得好悲惨012---Your work makes me sad.
真是的  我好想要那间公寓012---Oh, man, I want that place so much.
我还以为一定会成功012---And I was so sure that was going to work.
那12块算是丢到水里了012---There's 12 bucks I'll never see again.
好了  想看电影就得快了012---All right, we'd better go if we're gonna catch that movie.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
钱德  再见  我已经开始想你了012---Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
你看到她了  嗲里嗲气  还捏我吗012---Okay, did you see that? With the inappropriate, and the pinching?
看到了012---Actually, I did.
你相信她对我有意思了吧012---So now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
天哪  她知道我们的事了012---Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She knows about us.
真的还假的012---Are you serious?
菲比知道了  她想吓我们012---Phoebe knows, and she's just trying to freak us out.
这是唯一的解释012---That's the only explanation for it.
那我好捏的屁股和激凸的二头肌呢012---Okay, but what about my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps?
她知道了012---She knows.
乔伊012---Joey.
怎样012---Yeah?
菲比知道我们的事了012---Phoebe knows about us.
我没告诉她们012---Well, I didn't tell them.
她们  "她们"是谁012---Them? Who's "them"?
菲比和乔伊012---Uh, Phoebe and Joey.
乔伊012---Joey.
和瑞秋012---And Rachel.
我想告诉你们  但她们逼我不能说012---Look, I would have told you, but they made me promise not to tell.
天哪  对不起012---Oh, man. I'm sorry.
那现在没事了吧012---But, hey, it's over now, right?
你们可以告诉她们你们知道了012---Because you can tell them you know they know...
我就可以恢复我状况外的本色了012---...and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing.
除非  没有"除非"  现在就要了结012---Unless-No, not "unless." This must end now.
她们还自以为高明012---Oh, man, they think they are so slick messing with us.
她们不知道我们知道她们知道012---But they don't know that we know that they know.
所以  没错012---So. Ah, yes.
耍人的要变成被耍的了012---The messers become the mes-sees.
罗斯  别再折磨自己了012---Oh, Ross, honey, you gotta stop torturing yourself.
你为什么不去找别的公寓嘛012---Why don't you just find another apartment?
我这个月已经看了上千间公寓012---I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month.
没有哪一间比得上那一间012---None of them even compares to that one.
你知道你应该怎么做012---You know what you should do?
你应该找出他的嗜好  拿来跟他套交情012---You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him.
例如我对乔伊有所求012---Yeah. Like if I wanted something from Joey...
我就会聊  三明治012---...I would strike up a conversation about, say, urn, sandwiches...
或是我的内衣012---...or, uh, my underwear.
我在听012---I'm listening.
看吧012---See?
好棒的主意012---That is a great idea.
而且我了解丑裸男  因为我们偷窥了他5年012---And I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for five years.
所以我又重新占了上风012---So that gives me back my edge. Ha, ha.
好  他有一张跳床012---Let's see now. He had the trampoline.
被他跳坏了  他有双倒吊鞋012---But he broke that. Well, he had gravity boots.
也被他穿坏了012---Yeah, he broke those too.
所以他喜欢破坏东西012---So he likes to break stuff.
好  我得去接小班  不过我会想出来的012---Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben, but I will figure something out.
他之前不是有一只猫012---Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
别提那个  会害他心情不好012---I wouldn't bring that up. It would probably just bum him out.
可怜的猫咪  没看到大屁股压下来012---Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.
喂012---Hello?
在  等一下  她就在旁边012---Oh, yeah, hey. Hold on a second, she's right here.
钱德找你012---It's Chandler.
你好012---Hello, you.
菲比  我一整天都在想你012---Hello, Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
你之前的提议  说我不心动是骗人的012---Well, you know that thing you said before? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
是吗012---Really?
对  听着  乔伊晚上不在012---Yeah. Listen, Joey won't be here tonight.
你要不要过来  我让你模我的二头肌012---Why don't you come over and I'll let you, uh, feel my bicep.
或者是别的地方012---Or maybe more.
我待会再给你答覆  再见012---I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye.
天哪  他找我去模他的二头肌和别的地方012---Oh, my God. He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more.
不会吧  是真的012---Are you kidding? No.
他居然背着摩妮卡012---I cannot believe he would do that to Mon--
乔伊  他们知道我们知道吗012---Joey? Do they know that we know?
不知道  乔伊012---No. Joey?
他们知道你们知道了  我就知道012---They know you know. Ooh, I knew it.
那两个人真扯012---Oh, I cannot believe those two.
他们以为他们可以耍我们  想耍我们是吧012---God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! 
他们不知道我们知道  他们知道我们知道了012---They don't know that we know they know we know.
乔伊  你不能说012---And, Joey, you can't say anything.
我也不想说了012---I couldn't even if I wanted too.
你好  我是罗斯盖勒012---Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller.
我也申请要租你的公寓012---I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment...
我知道竞争很激烈  但是012---...and I realize that the competition is fierce, but...
抱歉  我注意到你光着身体012---I'm sorry, I can't help but notice that you're naked and...
我为你鼓掌012---I applaud you-
我也好想光着身体012---Man, I wish I was naked.
看起来好舒服012---I mean, this-this looks so great.
这正是上帝造人的本意012---That is how God intended it.
你看她们多慌  她们绝对会退缩012---Look at them. They're panicked. Oh, yeah, they're totally gonna back down.
没错012---Oh, yeah.
好  他敢约我  我就敢去012---All right, if he wants a date, he's going to get a date.
我要过去了  好012---I'm going to go in. Okay, okay.
性感一点012---Be sexy.
拜托012---Please.
钱德  我晚上可以过去012---So, Chandler, I'd love to come by tonight.
真的012---Really?
当然  就7点吧012---Oh, absolutely. Should we say around 7?
好012---Yes.
很好  我很期待跟你发生性关系012---Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
快来看  丑裸男有裸友来访012---Hey, hey, check it out, check it out. Ugly Naked Guy's got a naked friend.
真的012---Oh, yeah.
天哪  那是我们的朋友012---Oh, my God. That's our friend.
是裸罗斯  是罗斯012---It's Naked Ross. It is Ross!
上场喽012---Showtime.
瑞秋  拿香水来012---Okay, Rachel, get me perfume.
乔伊  帮我拿一瓶酒和两个酒杯012---And, Joey, could't you get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
放心好了012---All right, it'll be great.
只要让她以为你想跟她上床  她绝对会吓到012---You just make her think you want to have sex with her and it'll freak her out.
那么  听着  我到底得撑到什么程度012---Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
别紧张  她会比你先投降012---Relax, she's gonna give in way before you do.
你怎么知道  因为你跟我同队012---How do you know? Because you're on my team.
我这一队总是赢012---And my team always wins.
赢这种事012---At this?
总之去吓她  快去012---Just go get some. Go.
好  我会站在门外听012---Okay, honey, now, I'm gonna try to listen from right here.
好  等下012---Okay. Okay. Oh, wait.
好主意  等等012---Good idea. Yeah.
别把料都爆光了  好012---Don't give away the farm. Okay.
菲比012---Phoebe.
钱德  进来吧012---Chandler. Come on in.
我正要进去012---I was going to.
我带了酒来  你要吗012---Um, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
好啊012---Sure.
总算要开始了  紧张吗012---So here we are. Nervous?
我不会  你呢012---Me? No. You?
不会  这样正合我意012---No. I want this to happen.
我也是012---So do I.
我去放点音乐012---I'm going to put on some music.
那我 我跳舞给你看好了012---Maybe-Maybe I'll dance for you.
你真美012---You look good.
谢谢012---Thanks. Heh.
你说这种话让我好想012---You know, when you say things like that, it makes me wanna...
扯掉你的毛衣背心012---...rip that sweater vest right off.
不如进房里再说吧012---Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
真的吗  你不想吗012---Really? Oh, do you not want to?
不是  不是012---No. No.
只是我想先脱掉衣服012---I just, you know, first, I wanna take off all my clothes...
让你替我擦乳液012---...and have you rub lotion on me.
听起来不错012---Well, that would be nice.
我去拿乳液012---I'll go get the lotion.
情况完全失控了  她要我帮她擦乳液012---This is totally getting out of hand, okay? She wants me to put lotion on her.
她在吓你  她没打算放弃012---She's bluffing. Look, she's not backing down.
她还这样012---She went like this--
他没打算放弃  他去拿乳液了012---He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
真是的  你们还没好吗012---Oh, man, aren't you guys done yet?
我想坐我的椅子012---I want to sit in my chair.
乔伊   菲比一突破钱德的心里防线012---Joey, look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler...
这一切就结束公开了012---...the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
我喜欢012---Ooh, I like that.
我知道  让他看你的胸罩  他怕胸罩  他解不开012---Oh, okay. Show him your bra. He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
乔伊012---Joey!
你没把扣子都挑开012---Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
老经验了012---It's not my first time.
你给我回去  色诱她让她屈服012---You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks.
好  等一下012---Okay. Give me a second.
你打扫过吗  当然喽012---Did you clean up in here? Of course.
你…要走了012---Oh, you're, uh-You're going?
除非你跟我走  爱人012---Um, not without you, lover.
这是我的胸罩012---So this is my bra.
非常  非常好看012---It's very, very nice.
过来012---Well, come here.
我很高兴我们要做爱了012---I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.
你是该高兴  我的身体很柔软012---You should be. I'm very bendy.
我要吻你了  除非我先吻你012---I'm gonna kiss you now. Not if I kiss you first.
接下来就只能接吻了012---Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but kiss.
终于来了012---Here it comes.
我们的初吻012---Our first kiss.
好  你赢了012---Okay, okay, okay. You win.
我不能跟你上床012---Ha! I can't have sex with you.
为什么  因为我爱摩妮卡012---And why not? Because I'm in love with Monica.
你什么012---You're-You're what?
爱她  没错  我爱她012---Love her. That's right. I love her.
我爱她012---I love her.
我爱你  摩妮卡012---I love you, Monica.
我也爱你  钱德012---I love you too, Chandler.
我以为你们只是搞在一起  我不知道你们相爱012---I just thought you guys were doing it. I didn't know you were in love.
兄弟012---Dude.
向菲比致敬  强劲的对手012---Hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.
还有  你的胸部还晾在外面呢012---And may I say your breasts are still showing?
天哪012---God.
好啊  就这样012---All right. So that's it?
结束了  大家都知道了012---It's over. Everybody knows.
实际上  到现在罗斯还不知道012---Well, actually, Ross doesn't.
对  请你们先别告诉他012---Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
就是这里  新罗斯的新家012---A new place for a new Ross.
我一布置好  就请你和同事012---I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over...
过来坐坐012---...once it's, you know, furnished.
很高兴看到你重新振作012---I must say, it's nice to see you back on your feet.
我是振作了  脾气暴躁的事都过去了012---Well, I am that, uh, and the whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
我在想你是不是该回馆里上班了012---I wonder if it's time for you to rejoin our team at the museum.
唐诺  那就太好了012---Oh, Donald, that would be great.
我已经准备好重回岗位  我012---I am totally ready to come back to work. l__

我看见你在对我妹做什么了  你给我滚出来012---I saw what you were doing to my sister, now, get out here!
听着  我们玩得很开心012---Well, listen, we had a good run.
总共4个或5个月之久012---You know? What was it? Four, five months?
比很多人一辈子加起来都久012---I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime.
再见  保重  再见了012---So goodbye, take care, bye-bye then.
你干什么  我要跑路了012---What are you doing? Oh, I'm going on the lam.
过来  钱德  过来  我应付得了罗斯012---Come on, Chandler. Come on. I can handle Ross.
等一下012---Hold on.
罗斯老哥  你好吗012---Hey, Ross. What's up, bro?
你干了什么好事012---What the hell are you doing?
发生什么事了012---Hey, what's going on?
我想  罗斯发现我和摩妮卡的事了012---Well, I think-I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
他人就在那里012---Dude, he's right there.
我以为你是我最好的朋友  这是我妹妹啊012---I thought you were my best friend. This is my sister.
我最要好的朋友和我妹妹  我真不敢相信012---My best friend and my sister. I cannot believe this.
我们不是玩玩而已  我爱她012---We're not just messing around. I love her.
我爱着她012---Okay? I'm in love with her.
抱歉让你这样发现012---I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way.

不用了  我们知道一阵子了012---Oh, no, that's okay. We've actually known for a while.
什么  什么  你们知道012---What? What? You guys knew?
你们都知道  却没告诉我012---You all knew and you didn't tell me?
是啊  罗斯  我们很担心你012---Well, Ross, we were worried about you,okay?
不知道你会有什么反应012---We didn't know how you were going to react.
你们担心我012---You were worried about me?

要是你们生了小孩  我们生小孩012---If you guys ever have kids-Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're having kids?
教父是我的012---I call godfather.
哪能这样说的012---You can't just call godfather.
你不觉得应该由她哥哥当吗012---Don't you think her brother should be godfather?
当然  你有心就应该先喊012---Sure. If you cared enough to call it first.
你们想得太远了  十万八千里的远012---Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us. Yeah, big zero-gravity moon steps.
我刚想到一样最棒的结婚礼物012---Oh, oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
我跟你送  我什么都想不到012---Oh, I'll go in on that with you. I couldn't think of anything.
凯蒂012---Hey, Katie.
各位  这是凯蒂  嘿012---Hey, everyone, this is Katie. Hi.

我最爱吃中国菜了012---I love Chinese.
你怎么知道我爱吃中国菜012---How did you know I love Chinese?
她真可爱012---She is so cute.
可以塞进口袋里012---You could fit her right in your little pocket.
我不知道  我很喜欢她  她人很好  但是012---I don't know. I mean, I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
但是怎样012---But what?
她老爱打我012---She keeps punching me.
用她刚才那种可爱的方式012---In the cute little, sweet way she just did?
力道比表面上看大多了  好吗012---Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks, okay?
她把我打痛了012---She-she-she's hurting me.
我知道了  你需要保镖012---I know what you need. You need a bodyguard.
罗斯  班下课后有事吗012---Hey, Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
别这样  乔伊有烦恼了  他被个小女孩揍了012---Okay, come on, Joey is having a problem. There's a little girl who's beating him up.

亲爱的  我知道你一定  一定非常难受012---Honey, I know. This must be really, really difficult for you, and--
抱歉  我握痛你了吗012---Oh, I'm sorry, am I hurting you?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.

浴室用香精蜡烛012---And a scented candle for the bathroom.
你知道的012---Because, well, you know.
谢谢  谢谢  再次感谢012---Well, thanks. Thanks. And thanks, I guess.
欢迎你搬进来  我是史提夫沙拉  管委会主席012---Hi. Welcome to the building. I'm Steve Cera, President of the tenants' committee.
你好  我是罗斯盖勒  这是我朋友菲比012---Oh, hi. Ross Geller. And, uh, this is my friend Phoebe.
菲比  你好  主席先生012---Hi, Phoebe. Mr. President.
我来跟你谈霍华的事012---I, uh, came to talk to you about Howard.
霍华012---Howard?
是的  他是这里的杂工  下星期退休012---Yeah, he's the handyman. He's gonna be retiring next week...
这里的住户决定每人交一百元012---...and everyone who lives here is kicking in a hundred bucks...
作为"感谢他多年来的辛劳"012---...as a "thank you for all the hard work" type of thing.
真有人情味 是啊012---Oh, that's nice. Yeah.
所以你想开支票还是012---So you want to give me a check, or...?
你不必现在给我  你可以塞进我家门口012---You don't have to give it to me now. You can slip it under my door.
不  不是那样的  我才刚搬来012---No, no, it's not that. It's just-I just moved in.
他在这里工作了25年012---Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
但我才搬进来25分钟012---Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
好012---Oh.
我懂了012---Okay, I get it.
等等  我很抱歉  但我甚至没见过霍华012---No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard.
我不认识霍华012---I mean, I don't know Howard.
霍华是杂务工人012---Howard's the handyman.
但对我来说他只是个人012---Yes, but to me he's just "man."
好  随便012---Okay. Fine. Whatever.
欢迎你搬进来012---Welcome to the building.
真是有够扯的012---Can you believe that guy?
是啊  我很喜欢他的眼镜012---Yeah. I really like his glasses.
史提夫主席逢人就说我吝啬012---So then President Steve told everyone I was a Cheapskate...
现在整栋楼的人都讨厌我012---...and now the whole building hates me.
有小孩朝我的膝盖吐口水012---A little kid spit on my knee.
你们猜怎样  我要办一场派对  邀请整栋楼的人012---You know what? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right, for everyone in the building.
我要请他们坐下  告诉他们  我不是坏人012---And I'm gonna sit them all down and explain to them that I am not a bad guy.
不是吝啬  我只是个012---I am not a cheap guy. I'm just a guy...
坚持理念012---...who stands up for what he believes in.
有原则的人012---A man with principles.
听起来真好玩012---Sounds like a fun party. Mm.
罗斯  如果你希望邻居喜欢你012---Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you...
为什么不付钱算了012---...why don't you just pay the hundred bucks?
办一场派对更花钱  那不重要012---A party's gonna cost you way more. That doesn't matter.
这是原则问题  重点是我的原则012---It's my principles. We're talking about my principles.
好  我以为重点是讨邻居喜欢012---Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
等他们参加过我的派对  就会喜欢我了012---Oh, they'll like me once they come to my awesome par-tay.
我得走了  我要去买名牌012---Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
那个派对动物会是你的大舅子012---And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
真幽默  但别对着摩妮卡讲012---Very, very funny. But don't say things like that in from of Monica.
别让她有那些念头012---I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
钱德  你应该知道012---Um, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas...
她可能本来就有那种念头了012---...are probably already in Monica's head?
为什么012---Why?
因为她爱你  你也爱她012---Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
那又怎样呢012---Yeah, so? What's that supposed to mean?
钱德  你不要被吓到  我只是在讲你知道的事012---Hey, Chandler, don't freak out. I'm telling you something you already know.
她因理查不要小孩而跟他分手012---Come on. She broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies.
她是个女人  快30了  而且她是摩妮卡012---And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and, you know, it's Monica.
我不是那样看的  我看到两个摩妮卡012---I don't see it that way. Okay? I see two Monicas:
朋友的摩妮卡住在对面  想生一大堆小孩012---The one that was my friend who lives across the hall and wanted a lot of babies.
另一个新的摩妮卡跟我交往  谁晓得她想要什么012---And the new Monica who I started to date. Now, who is to say what she wants?
我说得没错  我说得没错吧012---I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
你说得对012---Yeah, you're right.
你说得一点也没错  情况确实完全不同012---You are absolutely right. I mean, that makes everything different.
好吧012---0key.
一点也没有不同  对吧012---It's not different, is it?
除非 "不同"等于一样012---Not unless "different" means the same.
你跟那个服务生好逗喔  你真是个疯子012---You were so funny with that waiter. You're such a nut.
扮吸血鬼本来就好笑012---You know, breads-tick fangs are always funny.
是你让它变好笑的  是你好笑012---No, you make them funny. You're the funny one.
凯蒂  听着  我们得沟通一下012---Uh, look, Katie, uh, listen, we need to talk, okay?
我喜欢你  我真的很喜欢你012---Um, look, I like you. I really do. I like you a lot, okay?
但当你开玩笑打我012---But sometimes when you playfully punch me like that...
感觉就像被一根很小  但很结实的球棒打到012---...it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny, but a very real bat.
我哪能把你打痛012---Oh. Like I could hurt you.
你在取笑我的身材吗  没有啊012---Are you making fun of my size? No.
不要取笑我的身材012---Don't make fun of me because of my size.
这种感觉真好012---Isn't this great? Mm.
真想永远这样012---Couldn't you just stay like this forever?
钱德012---Chandler?
你想不想永远这样012---Couldn't you just stay here forever?
这样  那样  哪样都可以012---Yeah, here, somewhere else. You know, wherever. Ha, ha.
你还好吗  我很好012---Are you okay? Yeah. I'm cool.
很随性012---Casual.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
只是随便混混玩玩  跟你随性的交往012---Just hanging out. Having fun, you know, uh, with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
我就知道  我就知道你会这样012---Man, I knew it. I knew you were going to do this.
怎样012---What?
被大家讨论和开玩笑的事吓到012---Get all freaked out because everybody was joking around about marriage.
你的确想要那些事吧012---Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
你知道我想要什么012---And you know what I want?
没错  你想要小孩  你是孩子狂012---Yes. You want babies. You have baby fever.
我才没有孩子狂012---I do not have baby fever.
拜托  你超迷恋小孩和婚姻012---Oh, please. You are obsessed with babies and marriage...
和一切跟小孩和婚姻有关的事012---...and everything that's related to babies and marriage.
我有个提议  让这个压力锅减压一下吧012---You know what? Why don't we turn the heat down on this pressure cooker?
你疯了吗012---Have you lost your mind?
这不是我的问题012---Chandler, this isn't about me.
是你不敢做出承诺012---This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap.
少来  我了解你  我知道你脑袋里在想什么012---Uh-uh. I know you, okay? I know the thoughts that you have in your head.
你并非什么都知道012---Well, you don't know everything.
你知道我今晚要跟瑞秋出去吗012---Did you know I'm going outwith Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm?
你知道最幼稚的是你吗012---And that the only baby around here is you?
你知道我连看都不想看你吗012---And did you know I can't even look at you right now?
那我倒是不知道012---Yeah, well, I did not know that.
不会有事吧  她不会离开我吧  这是可以解决的012---It's gonna be okay, right? I mean, she's not gonna leave me. This is fixable.
是的  当然012---Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
我可以解决  不  不可能012---By me? Oh, no, no, no.
除非你有大动作012---Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
要非常大012---Yeah, big, though.
女主角来了012---Shh. The missus.
阿甘  我要一杯咖啡012---Gunther, can I get a coffee?
外带012---To go.
摩妮卡012---Monica--
我还不想跟你说话012---I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
告诉我怎样弥补012---Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
什么  我们都这样012---What? That's what we do.
我做错事  你教我怎么补救  我补救完012---I mess up, you tell me how to fix it and I do.
然后  你又觉得我很可爱012---And then, you know, you think I'm all cute again.
我不想再当你的爱情指导了012---I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor.
这次你得自己想  好吗012---You're gonna have to figure this out for yourself.
你要知道  如果你懒得好好经营感情012---You know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship...
就别谈感情012---...then don't be in one.
菲比  菲比012---Phoebe.Phoebe.
罗斯012---Oh, hi, Ross.
你在干什么012---What are you doing here?
我以为这是你的派对  结果是替霍华办的派对012---Oh, I thought this was your party, and it turns out it's a party for Howard.
他真是个老可爱012---He's the sweetest little man.
菲比  再见  谢谢你出钱012---See you, Phoebe. Oh, and, hey, thanks for chipping in.
不客气012---Oh, sure.
你出了钱012---You chipped in?
对啊  一百块钱012---Yeah, uh-huh, hundred dollars.
菲比  你居然给他们钱012---Phoebe, I can't believe you gave him money.
你不是也同意他们要我出钱  是很不合理的012---I thought you agreed it was unreasonable that they asked me for that money.
对啊  但他们没有要我出012---Yeah, but they didn't ask me, you know?
当性感大方的陌生人012---This way I'm just, you know, the exotic, generous stranger.
最好玩了012---That's always fun to be.
但你让我很难堪012---Yeah, but you're making me look bad.
不  谁说的  我是在帮你加分012---No, I'm not. No, if anything, I'm making you look better.
他们会看见你在跟我说话  我又很红012---They'll see you talking to me, and I'm a hit.
菲比012---Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
罗斯012---Oh, hey, Ross.
你们或许可以交换住处  012---Urn, say, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments.
菲比跟我们比较扎堆012---Because Phoebe is more our kind of people.
你考虑一下012---Something to think about it.
是我不好012---Yeah, okay, my bad.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
哇  你看起来好壮012---Wow. You look big.
谢谢  最近有在练012---Thanks, I've been working out.
看得出来我穿六件毛衣吗012---Hey, listen, is it obvious I'm wearing six sweaters?
看得出来012---Uh,yeah.
但看不出来为什么012---But it's not obvious why.
我要跟凯蒂分手  所以得多加几层护垫012---Well, look, I'm breaking up with Katie, so I had to put on some extra padding.
你知道的  她平常高兴就会打我012---You know, I mean, if she hits me when she's happy...
现在我要收回乔伊之爱012---...can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me...
她岂不是打得更用力012---...when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  好可爱的外套012---Hey. Hey, cute jacket.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks.
你真好  哇哦012---That's so sweet. Whoa. Ow.
哇啊012---Oh, "OW."
是乔伊要你叫的吗  你们真是够了012---Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys are too much.
你知道吗  说真的012---You know what? I gotta tell you...
我觉得你才够了012---...I think you're the one that is too much.
乔伊的朋友真棒012---Joey has the nicest friends.
女朋友更棒012---And the nicest girlfriend.
你真好012---You're so sweet.
你才好  哇哦012---You're so sweet. Ow!
乔伊012---Joey?
她踢我012---She just kicked me.
你不替我出头吗012---Well, aren't you gonna do something?
你最好替我出头  否则我现在就走人012---You better do something or I'm gonna walk out that door right now.
你要不要012---Well, are you gonna?
不要012---Nah.
菲比   我就是这个意思012---Phoebe? Ha, ha. That's what I was saying.
菲比  菲比012---Phoebe? Phoebe?
这真是人间地狱  我走了好不好012---This is a disaster. Can't I please just go?
不行  我正在帮你说好话012---No. no. I'm talking you up to people.
再等一下下  放轻松  拿东西吃  好吗012---Just give it a little time, all right? Relax. Get something to eat.Okey.
你跟他们说了什么012---So, uh, what did you tell them about me?
我说了你和艾蜜莉的事  好争取同情心012---Um, I told them about you and Emily. You know, trying to get some sympathy.
但说着说着  你怎么就成了坏人012---But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
什么  我想我说的方式不对012---What? Yeah, I think I told it wrong.
我们应该先聊聊012---We should talk about that...
我不太知道前因后果012---...because I don't totally understand what happened there.
这个蛋糕真好吃012---Oh. This cake is really good.
看吧  情况已经在好转了012---Okay, see? Things are looking up already.
天哪  有人切了霍华的蛋糕012---Oh, my God. Someone cut Howard's cake.
谁会做这种低级的事012---Who would do a thing like that?
3B012---3-B.
你白吃白喝  扫了大家的兴012---Okay, you got your free food, you ruined everyone's fun.
是不是该回家了  没错012---Don't you think it's time you went home? Yeah.
快滚  回3B去  3B012---Yeah, go back to 3-B, 3-B.
大家安静一下  拜托  安静一下012---All right, everyone, calm down. Everyone, calm down.
我有话要说012---I have something that I would like to say.
这里有谁喜欢罗斯012---Who here likes Ross?
你们当然不喜欢他012---Of course you don't like him.
他不交钱012---He didn't give you any money.
我问"有谁喜欢他"  他自己举手012---He raised his own hand when I asked, "Who here likes Ross?"
他还贴两个名牌012---And he's wearing two nametags.
老实说  刚开始我也不喜欢他012---I'll be honest with you guys. When I first met Ross, I didn't like him at all.
但了解他之后  我就发现他012---But then once I got to know him, I saw that he's really sweet...
很好  也很大方012---...and caring and very generous.
请不要还不了解他  就论断他  好嘛012---I mean, all I'm saying is don'tjudge Ross before you get to know him, all right?
我现在很喜欢你们  但是刚见面时012---You know, I like all of you guys now. But when I first met you, you know...
寇特  粗鲁的酒鬼012---Kurt? I thought, you know, abrasive drunk.
萝拉  笨得令人傻眼012---Um, Lola, mind-numbingly stupid.
还有你们  淘金女  老牛吃嫩草的变态012---And, okay, you guys: Gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.
你们懂我的意思吧012---So I think you all know what I mean.
我没想到他们会扔东西012---Obviously, I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things.
我想说我一直羞辱他们  你就会跳出来帮他们012---I just thought if I kept insulting them you would jump in and defend everyone.
你就可以变成英雄012---Then you could look like the hero.
对喔012---Oh, wow, yeah.
太深奥了012---See, I did not get that.
摩妮卡呢  她在哪儿  我有急事找她  她在吗012---Where's Monica? Where is she? I need to talk to her, it's urgent. Is she here?
我是摩妮卡  我有急事要找你  好012---I'm Monica. I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
我想了很多012---Okay. Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking...
我们的事  很多  你和我的事012---...about us. You know, a lot of, uh, "us" thinking.
我猜只有一个补救的办法012---And, uh, well, I guess there's only one way to do this.
等等  你要干什么  摩妮卡012---Wait, wait. What are you doing? Monica--
不  拜托  不要012---No, no, no. Don't do it.
你愿意嫁给我吗012---Will you marry me?
毁了  什么馊主意012---Oh, no, no, no. What a bad idea.
我不敢看012---Oh, I can't not look at it.
钱德  你为什么要这样012---Chandler, why are you doing this?
我不知道012---I don't know.
但是我知道我不怕012---But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
钱德012---Chandler.
因为我  很抱歉012---I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
你真的觉得结婚的最好理由  是因为你很抱歉012---Do you, urn, really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
不  最好的理由是奉子成婚012---Oh, no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy.
抱歉大约排第四  在准备好了跟真的想结婚后面012---Sorry is pretty much fourth, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.
你愿意做我的妻子吗012---Will you be my wife?
钱德  你先静下来012---Chandler, um, I want you to take just a minute...
想想这件事有多荒谬012---...and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
我的确有点希望他们都不在012---Yeah, I'm kind of wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
这些事都不是我扯出来的012---You know that none of that stuff came from me.
我从来没说现在就想结婚生子012---I mean, I never said that I wanted to have babies and get married right now.
但我真的很乱  后来又跟他们谈过012---Yeah, I know, I was really confused, and then I talked to these guys.
谁啊  离婚两次的人和乔伊012---Who? Two divorces and Joey?
她说得对012---Hey. She's right, you know.
但这种奚落算什么012---Yeah, but still, cheap shot.
你知道吗   我不是要你012---You know when I said that I want you...
自己想该怎么做012---...to deal with relationship stuff all on your own?
你还做不到这点  我也这么认为012---Well, you're not ready for that. I didn't think I was.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
要是我答应了呢012---What would you have done if I had said yes?
那我会很开心012---Well, I would've been happy because...
能跟心爱的人共度下半生012---...I would have been able spend the rest of my life with the woman I love.
又或者你会在那扇门上  看到我的人形洞012---Or you would have seen a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.
罗斯  请把刀子给我  不  我才不要012---Hey, Ross, will you pass me that knife? No, I will not.
你不必这么凶吧012---It's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
你说得对  对不起  嫁给我好吗012---You're right. I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
我正想向你求婚012---Oh, and I was going to ask you to marry me...
因为我上星期忘了跟你打招呼012---...because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
不  等等  菲比  那种情况012---Oh, no, wait, Pheebs. I think with something like that...
应该只需要同居  但我也不确定  钱德012---...you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure. Chandler?
好  我还要被笑多久012---Ha, ha, okay, how long is this gonna go on?
那得看你012---Well, I think the length of teasing...
做的事有多扯012---...is directly related to how insane you were.
所以  会很久012---So a long time.
真好玩  记得〝我们分手了〞风波吗012---This is fun. Oh, hey, Rach, remember that whole "we were on a break" thing?
我很抱歉  嫁给我好吗012---Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me'?
不好笑012---That's not funny.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们在干什么  我们想填完字谜再去睡觉012---What are you guys doing up? We wanted to finish the crossword before bed.
你知道三个字  也是红色的一种012---Do you know a six-letter word for "red"?
深红色012---Dark-red.
应该不是  不过你待会可以玩连连看012---I think that's wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots in here for you later.
嘿  赭红色呢012---Hey, how, uh, about maroon?
没错  你好聪明012---Yes! You are so smart! Ha-ha-ha.

赶快填完去睡觉  好的012---Now, let's finish this and go to bed. Okay.
只剩一个012---There's only one left.
叁个字的动物  不是小狗  是012---Three-letter word. Not dog, but...
猫咪012---Cat.
没错012---Yes. Ha.
你好聪明012---You are so smart!
我爱你012---I love you.
我也爱你012---I love you too.
老友记  第五季  第16集  警察来了012---Friends  S05E16  The One With A Cop
还差小费012---We still need a tip.

有了012---I got it.
5分钱012---Nickel.
还差多少  2块钱012---How much more do we need? A couple of bucks.
10分钱012---Okay, dime.
你们继续聊  我会多花一点时间012---You guys should probably keep talking. This could take a while.
等等  你们看012---Wait, lookit!
哇啊012---Whoa!
天哪  这是警徽012---Oh, my God. This is a police badge!
真酷  但警察来这里干嘛  这里又不卖甜甜圈012--- Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Ha.
你能不能重来一次012---Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again?
我可以说个更好笑的012---I think I can come up with something better than that.
菲比   一定有人正在找那个警徽012---Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
没错  我应该送回去  知道吗  我去了警察局012---Yeah, I should take it back. Ooh,  but you know what? While I'm at the police station, ...
还可以看看十大通缉犯名单012---...I could check their Ten Most Wanted list.
因为我朋友丽西一直是排名第11大  今年也许会走运012---because my friend Fritzi's been Number 11 forever. so this could be her year! 
嘿  大家好  嘿  乔伊012---Hey, you guys. Hey, Joey.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
那是我的衣服吗012---Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
对  对不起  我会冷  冷了就借来穿了012---Yes, it is. I'm sorry. I borrowed it. I was cold. I hope it's okay.
没关系吧  你要穿  应该穿012---It's just that, uh, if you wear someone's sweatshirt...
你男朋友的衣服  才对吧012---...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?
我不是你的男朋友012---And I'm not him.
对不起  我现在就还你012---I'm sorry. I'll give it back.
不  不  不要012---No, no. No.
上面会沾满你的味道012---I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
你是说我很臭吗012---Are you saying I smell bad?
不  不是012---No. No.
你有一股青草香012---You smell like a meadow.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
他是怎么了012---What's with him?
乔伊上次去青草地  他妈妈被猎人射杀了012---Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
我还是不确定012---Yeah, I still don't know.
抱歉  我想买到理想的沙发  我希望这张沙发能让人觉得012---I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says:
"小朋友  欢迎"  同时也能让人觉得012---"Kids welcome here," but that also says
"来我身边吧"012---"Come here to me."
什么  你对小朋友说那种话012---What? You say that to kids?
不  不  不是012---No, no, no.
"来我身边吧"  是对小姐们说的012---The "Come here to me" is, you know, for the ladies.
罗斯  这是张好沙发  但不是神奇沙发012---Ross, honey, it's a nice couch, not a magic couch.
对啊  你的选择很正确012---Well, you picked a great couch.
是吗  是的012---Yeah? Yeah.
没错  请在这里签个名  没问题012---Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? Oh, sure.
没问题  这是012---Oh, what's, heh--?
运费几乎跟沙发价格一样贵012---The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
真是太扯了  他家离这里才三条街012---That's ridiculous. He lives three blocks away.
算了  我自己搬好了  谢谢012---You know what? I'll take it myself. Thank you.
瑞秋  来吧  好012---All right, Rash, come on. Let's go.
好012---Yeah.
开什么玩笑012---Are you kidding?
才三条街  又不是很重  抬抬看  快  快012---Come on. It's only three blocks. Uh, it's not very heavy. Try it. Come on! Come on!
喔  我行嘛  行012---Oh, I can do it. Yeah.
你们会很喜欢这张沙发的012---You two will really enjoy that couch.
我们  不是一对012---We're, uh, not together.
哇啊  哦  哦012---Oh, okay. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
难怪我看着怪怪的012---Something didn't quite add up there.
罗斯012---Ross.
你这话是什么意思  罗斯012---What's that supposed to mean? Ross.
你  她012---Well, you. Her. Heh.
她很...你知道 012---I mean, she's very...
你知道012---...you know.
你知道012---And you're, like...
而你却012---"NQU know'?
虽然与你无关  但我们确实交往过012---Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.

对  瑞秋012---Yeah. Rash'?

不只交往过012---Not only did we go out...
我们还做过298次012---...we did it 298 times!
罗斯012---Ross.

这位小姐  怎么了  你不能在树上熄香烟012---Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put your cigarette out on a tree.
没事  我可以  很方便的012---Yeah, I can. It worked well.
你不该这么做  别再这么做了012---But you shouldn't. So don't ever do that again.
我不会了  抽下一根烟之前不会012---I won't till I have my next cigarette.
站住012---Hold it!
纽约警察  别动012---NYPD. Freeze, punk!
什么012---What?
没错  你被活逮了012---That's right. You are so busted.
把她带走012---Book 'em.
你在跟谁说话  别挣扎了  红发女012---Who are you talking to? Save it, red!
不想在笼子里过夜  就跟那颗树道歉012---Unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
我才不跟一颗树道歉呢012---I am not going to apologize to a tree.
赶快道歉  否则我要叫人了012---You apologize to the tree right now, or I am calling for backup.
来人啊  来人啊012---Backup! Backup!
对不起  对不起012---I'm sorry! Sorry!
好  别来了  别来了012---Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!

我是有说  但其实没有  来吧012---Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
好  往左012---Okay, go left.
左  左012---Left. Left.
好  拜托  这儿没有左可以往左了012---Okay, you know what? There is no more left, left!

抬高到你的头上  你行的012---Straight up over your head. You can do it!
你行的012---You can do it!

好  没问题吧  很好012---Go, go. Good, good.
没问题吧  没问题吧  没问..012---You got it, right? You got it, right? You got--
你觉得放在那里好看吗012---Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
这家伙还在碎碎念012---...so this guy was all...
我就说  "重案组  布非"012---And I'm all, "Buffay! Homicide!"
真是太帅了012---It was just so cool! Ha-ha-ha.
菲比  你应该拿去还的012---Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back.
我知道  但行善的感觉好棒012---I know, but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
但假扮警察很严重  你会被逮捕的012---Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You can get arrested.
你现在就会被逮捕012---You could get arrested right now!
好吧  我得拿去还了  我被权力冲昏头了012---All right, yeah, I'd better take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嗨  乔伊012---Hi, Joe.
我不知道你们会在012---Yeah. I didn't know you guys were gonna be here.
乔伊  你尝尝看  什么  为什么012---Hey Joey, do me a favor, sweetie. Taste this. What? Why?
你是怎么了  没事啊012---What is going on with you? Nothing.
拜托  你一整天都怪怪的012---Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day.
好吧  是有一件事  我012---All right. There is something. I, uh...
我做了一个梦012---I kind of had a dream.
但我不想谈012---But I don't want to talk about it.
马丁路德金恩也这么说  还得了012---Oh, whoa. What if Martin Luther King had said that?
我有一个梦012---I kind of have a dream.
但是我不想谈012---I don't want to talk about it.
跟摩妮卡有关012---Look, it involved Monica.
你梦到我正在交往的女孩  真是酷啊012---You had a dream about a girl I'm seeing? Oh, that is so cool.
我不知梦见他的女朋友多少次012---I can't tell you how many times I dreamt about a girl he was seeing.
总之  我们在谈你的梦  我爱你  你的梦012---Anyway, we were talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
放心  没有任何性意味  自从发现你们的事012---Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it. I haven't dreamt about her like that...
我就不对她做那种梦了012---...since I found out about you two-ish.
那你梦到什么012---What was the dream about?
好吧012---Well, okay.
你是我的女朋友  我们在填字谜012---You were my girlfriend. We were doing the crossword puzzle.
就像你们昨晚那样012---Y'know like you guys were doing last night.
就这样  我爱上摩妮卡了 我会搬走012---So that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
乔伊  等等  那并不代表你爱我012---Wait, Joey, come on. That doesn't mean that you're in love with me.
不是吗012---It doesn't?
它可能有很多涵义  例如012---It could mean anything. Like, uh...
你突然眼红我成为这里的猛男012---...all of a sudden you're jealous that I've become the apartment stud.
这个  听起来比较像你的梦012---That kinda sounds like your dream, dude.
或是你看到我和钱德在一起  很亲密012---Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me together, and we y'know were being close and stuff...
你也想跟别人拥有这种亲密关系012---...and then you just want to have that with someone too.
我在梦里的确很享受那种亲密012---In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
好  听着012---Okay, look.
你爱上摩妮卡了吗012---Are you attracted to Monica?
就是现在  此时此刻  爱上她了吗012---Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
其实没有  这就对了012---Not really. There you have it!
当然啊  我穿得这么随便012---Heh. Well, sure! I'm just wearing sweats!
但那是好事012---But that's good!
你不是爱我  你只是想交个女朋友012---You're not in love with me. because you just want a girlfriend!
不  我觉得不是交女朋友的问题012---No, I don't think it's just about getting a girlfriend.
对  我可以找个女朋友012---Yeah, Y'know? I mean, I could get a girlfriend.
对  我们可以坐在那里填字谜012---Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crossword puzzles.
但我们会拥有你们那种亲密感觉吗012---But y'know are we ever gonna have y'know the closeness like you guys have?
摩妮卡和我是从朋友做起的  也许关键在这里012---Monica and I were friends before we started dating. Maybe that's it.
先做朋友012---Friends first?
有意思012---That's interesting.
你们都事后当朋友  没有  也从来没有过012---You become friends after? No, never done that either.
嘿  你们有量尺吗012---Um, do you guys have a tape measure?
有  在我房里012---Oh, yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.
没错012---That's right.
乔伊  怎么了012---What's up, Joey?
你好吗012---How you doing?
抱歉  这是你的车吗  对012---Excuse me. Is this your car? Yeah.
停在这里不太好  你挡住出入口了012---Well, I don't think it's nice of you to park here. You're blocking the entrance.
放心  没关系的012---Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
我觉得有关系  你就有关系  因为我是条子012---It's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you because I'm a cop.
我也是012---So am I.
完了012---Oh, no.
好  你是条子  可以任意停车012---Oh, okay. so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere,
因为我也是条子012---'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. 
好  继续努力  收到012---So, all right, keep up the good work. Ten-four.
等一下  你是哪个分局的012---Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
我在57分局012---I'm with the, um, the 57th.
我认识你们重案组一位刑警  我在风化组012---I know a guy in Homicide up there. I'm in Vice.
事实上  我正在卧底  我是妓女012---Yeah, In fact, I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
风化组还有谁012---Who else is in Vice up there?
你认识012---Um, do you know, um...
西波威兹吗012---...Sipowitz?
西波威兹  不  应该不认识012---Sipowitz? No, I don't think so.
对  西波威兹  大块头  有点秃012---Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah. Big guy, kind of bald.
我不认识他012---I don't know him.
不要打给他  他不在  他出去了012---Don't try to call him or anything. Because he's not there. He's out.
他的拍档  刚死了012---His, um, partnerjust died.
帮我跟西波威兹致意012---Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry for his loss.
我会的  保重012---I sure will. Take care.
对了  我相信西波威兹不会有事的012---Hey, by the way, I'm sure Sipowitz is gonna be all right.
听说那个新来的小伙子很不错012---I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good.
你在哪里找到我的警徽的012---And where did you find my badge?
嘿  乔伊  你能不能帮我和罗斯搬沙发012---Hey, Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
我很想  但我要去上表演课  但你知道012---Aw, I'd love to but I got acting class. But you know what?
我可以为了你跷课的012---I guess I could blow that off for you.
谢谢012---Thanks.
瑞秋  我问你件事  我刚在对面跟摩妮卡和钱德聊天012---Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something.Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, 
他们可真亲密012---Boy, they are really tight.
是啊012---I know.
那种关系实在很不错012---Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. 
我也想自己弄一段012---I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
你想说什么  乔伊012---What's up, Joe?
我觉得他们感觉会那么好012---The reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
是因为他们是先做朋友012---...is because they were friends first, you know?
于是我问自己  谁是我朋友  你和菲比012---So I asked myself, who are my friends? You and Phoebe.
而我先遇见你  所以012---I saw you first, so...
你在说什么  我是说也许你我可以更进一步012---What are you saying? I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
乔伊012---You know, honey, um...
你先过见我012---..as, uh, flattered as I am...
真令我受宠若惊012---...that you saw me first...
但我不觉得我们应该更进一步012---...uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
我会对你很好012---I'll treat you real nice.
对  你知道吗012---Yeah. Well, you know, um...
我觉得先做朋友再交往  是一个很好的想法012---Listen, I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date.
但你应该先去认识一个人  跟她做朋友012---But I think the way you do it is you meet someone, become their friend...
建立基础  再约她出去012---...build a foundation, then ask them out on a date.
别对现有的朋友下手012---Don't hit on your existing friends.
那不是要等很久了012---Won't that take longer?
没错  没错012---Yeah. Yeah.
但是一旦得到了012---Oh, but once you find it...
真的很值得012---...it's so worth the wait.
这样012---Yeah.
我懂  我懂012---I understand. I understand.
很好012---Good.
天啊  如果先遇见菲比就好了012---Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.
来我身边吧012---Come here to me.
不  不  你来我身边012---No, no. You come here to me.
嘿  罗斯012---Hey, Ross.
我带援军来了  太好了  是乔伊吗012---Ahem, I brought reinforcements. Oh, great! You brought Joey?
只比他差点012--- Well, I brought the next best thing. Heh.
嘿012---Hey-
钱德  你带钱德来  只差一点的应该是摩妮卡012---Chandler?!  You brought Chandler? The next best thing would be Monica!
我应该感觉不爽了  但摩妮卡真的壮得可怕012---Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong...
看  我画了一张搬运草图012---Look, I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.
好  瑞秋  这是你012---Okay ,Rach, that's you.
这是沙发012---That's the couch.
那是什么012---Oh, what's that?
那是我012---Oh, that's me.
你把自己看得很雄壮喔012--- You certainly think a lot of yourself.
不  那是我的手臂012---No. That's my arm.
喔  我还以为你那么喜欢你的新沙发012---Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
总之听我的指示012---Just follow my lead.
好012---0key.
钱德  来吧012---Come on, Chandler.
好  开始了012---All right. Okay.

转  好012---Turn! Okay.
转012---Turn!
转012---Turn!
应该是转不动了  我觉得挤不上去012---I don't think we can turn anymore! I don't think it'll fit!
当然可以  快抬起来  抬起来  抬起来012---Yeah, it will. Come on! Up, up, up!
抬起来  很好012---UP! Yes!

中心点012---Pivot!

中心点012---Pivot!
中心点012---Pivot!
闭嘴  闭嘴  闭嘴012---Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
好  我看是上不来了012---I don't think it's gonna pivot anymore.
是吗012---You think?
好吧  搬下去再来一次012---All right, let's, uh, bring it back down and try again.
现在真的卡死了012---I think it's really stuck now.
想不到居然没成功  就是啊  我也没想到012---I can't believe that didn't work. I know. Me neither.
你都画了图了012---I mean, you had a sketch.
你说那个 "中心点"是什么意思012---What did you mean when you said "pivot"?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
怎么样  有交到新朋友吗012---How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
有  我认识了一个女人012---Yeah. I met this woman.
嘿  哇  哇012---Hey. Whoa, whoa.
她怎么样012---What's she like?
她的012---Uh, well, she's...
床上功夫很棒012---...really good in bed.
乔伊  你不是要先当朋友嘛012---Joey, I thought you were going to try to be friends first.
都是你的错  什么  为什么啊012---Well look, hey, it's all your fault. What? Why?
因为你给的不是忠告  是搭讪词012---Well because you didn't give me advice. No! You gave me a pickup line.
我一说要 "建立基础  先当朋友"012---As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, "build a foundation and be friends first."
她突然就...与我本身无关  觉得我难以抗拒012---I suddenly, through no fault of my own, I became irresistible to her!
她的室友也是012---And her roommate!
那亲密关系呢012---What about the "closeness"?
谁还管亲密啊  我们玩三P啊012---Closeness, schmosness! There was three of us, for crying out loud!
谁要吃彼萨012---All right! Hey, Who wants pizza?
我要  我要  我要012---I do! I do! I do!

我要找菲比布非  完了  是他  是那个警察012---I'm looking for Phoebe Buff ay. My God, it's him! It's that cop!
他居然找到我了  天哪  菲比  你会去坐牢吗012---I can't believe he found me! Oh my God, Phoebe,Are you going to go to jail?
我死也会拖你们下水的012---Well, If I'm going down, you guys are going down with me.
窝藏逃犯  起码要关1到3年012---Harboring a fugitive? That's one-to-three years minimum.
钱德  祝你好运012---Good luck, Chandler.
好  你可以逮捕我  但你抓不到我的把柄012---Okay, you can arrest me, Fine. but you'll never make it stick and you know it.
但我别无选择  这是我的职责所在  你了解吧012---Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. You understand, right?
当然  只要你了解我  会找我的律师来012---Yeah, as long as you understand that I'm gonna call my lawyer.
他会让你在庭上像个猪头  猪头012---And once he puts you on the stand, he's gonna make you look like a fool! Like a fool!
我不喜欢当猪头012---I don't like looking foolish.
这样吧  也许我今天不抓你  就说我来了 但你不在012---Y'know what? Maybe, uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
我不在就太好了012---I would love it if I weren't here!
既然你今晚不会入狱  我能不能012---Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight, I was wondering if you'd, um...

漂亮012---Nice.
我想不到你会来  约我出去012---Wow, I didn't see that coming. You're asking me out.
我可以表现得更好  但这些人一直盯着我看012---Yeah, I could've done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
好  我愿意跟你出去吃饭  警察先生012---Um, yeah, I'd like to go out with you, officer.

我的警徽上都是你的指纹  所以我上电脑查询012---Your fingerprints were all over my badge so I ran them through the computer.
这是你最后登记的住址  所以我就来看看012---This was listed as your last known address so I checked it out.
好厉害012---Oh, impressive.
没有你厉害  我看过你的纪录  你干过不少怪事012---Not as impressive as you. I looked at your record and you've done some weird stuff.
吃饭时再说012---We'll talk at dinner.

你要退这张沙发012---You want to return this couch?
它断成两半了012---It's cut in half.
我就是这个意思  是你把它切成两半的012---That's what I'm telling you. Did you out this couch in half?
这张沙发被切成两半012---This couch is cut in half!
我要换一张没有被切成两半的012---I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half.
你是说它送过去就这样了012---You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?

你去啊  勾引回来  瞎搅和012---Get in there, man. Flirt back. Mix it up!
人家知道啦012---Yeah, I'm down with that.
好  来喽012---Okay, here it goes.
你012---How...
好012---...you...
吗012---...doing?
有反应了  她挥手要我过去012---It worked! She's waving me over.
我马上过去012---I'll be right over
我看看  她住在三楼012---.Let's see, she's on the third floor...
哇  她真的很美啊  这还用你说012---She is pretty, huh? Tell me about it, huh?
不  不  不  我跟她没关系012---Oh, no, no. No, no! I'm not with her.
她只是摩妮卡012---Oh, that's just Monica.
嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joey!
我很会演吧012---Great stuff, huh?
这是你家012---This is your place?
当然是  请进  对了012---Yeah, of course it is. Oh, come on in. Ooh, ohh. Uh, 
经过窗户能假装在冲浪012---go by the window. You can pretend to be surfing.
可是我数过啊  这里住的不应该是你012---But I counted. You're not supposed to live here.
要命012---Oh, man!
怎么了012---Unh! What happened?
我最后跑到罗斯家去了  一定是我数错了012---I ended up at Ross' place. I must have miscounted or something.
可恶  她不在了012---Damn! She's not there anymore.
你看  罗斯在演"看电视"那段012---Oh, look, Ross is doing his "watching TV" bit.
不  乔伊  我觉得他真的在看电视012---No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.
嫌犯已失去踪迹012---We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
好  我现在非走不可了012---Okay, now I really have to go.
这真是太不公平了  有人开枪打店员012---It's so unfair that our date has to get cut short...
我们的约会就得中断012---...just because some guy shot at a store clerk.
亲爱的  我知道  但这是我的工作  好吧  不如我一起去012---I know, but it's my job. Then maybe I could come too?
嫌犯刚从水沟中裸体现身012---Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
好吧  你去就好012---All right, you go.
再见  好  再见012---Bye-bye. Okay. Bye.
天啊  怎么了012---Oh, God! What?
我好想念他012---Oh, I just miss him so much!
才几星期  就这么认真了012---For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
是啊  说来很奇怪  可是我没办法  他真的很体贴012---Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it, though. He's so sweet.
他像是只小狗狗  你知道012---He's like this little puppy dog, you know?
却很强悍  还会开枪打坏人012---But like a really tough one who shoots bad guys.
我最喜欢刚开始恋爱的感觉012---Ugh, I just love the beginning parts of relationships, you know?
彼此难分难舍012---You can't keep your hands off each other.
我知道  热恋是最棒的012---I know. It is the best. Ha, ha. Ha, ha.
你和钱德的热恋持续了多久012---So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
什么  我们还在热恋啊012---What? It's still going on.
少来  老实说  何时结束的012---Come on, seriously. When did it end?
我是很老实啊  我们总是黏在一起012---I am serious. We're all over each other all the time.
好吧  你们的事你最清楚  我只是好奇罢了012---Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
菲比  你别发神经了  好不好012---Why don't you just calm down, Phoebe, all right?
先把事实搞清楚  不要逢人便说全天下只有你们在热恋012---Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
天啊  睡狮被我吵醒了012---God, I woke the beast. Um...
显然是我错了  我失言012---I was wrong obviously. I just misspoke. It's okay.
没事了  没事了012---Well, it is okay. I mean...
只要你知道我和钱德  也和你们一样012---As long as you know Chandler and I are also hot and fiery.
火热缠绵就好012---I mean, just as hot as you.
我们的欲火012---I mean, our flame...
简直可以燎原012---Whoo! It is on fire!
摩妮卡  扫把还你012---Monica, here's your broom back.
你真可爱012---You are so cute.
喔  嘿  面试顺不顺利012---Oh, hey! How'd the interview go? Ugh!
糟透了  我犯了最蠢最丢人的错误012---Horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing.
你跟考官说要跟他老婆上床  然后又从椅子上跌下来了012---Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife then fall off your chair?
不是  那是怎么了012---No. So, what happened?
真是糟糕透顶  原本面试都很顺利012---Ugh, it was horrible! And the interview part went so well.
我还把大家逗笑了012---You know, like, I even made him laugh.
考官说到什么船的事012---He said something about a boat...
我回答说 "只要救生衣够多就行"012---...and I was like, "Well, yeah, if you've got enough life jackets."
相信我  当时真的很逗012---Trust me. It was actually very funny.
反正到了最后说再见012---Anyway, so we were saying goodbye and, uh... Ugh.
怎么了啦012---What happened?.
我们当时正要握手012---All right, we were shaking hands..
他缓缓朝我靠过来012---...and he kind of leaned in toward me.
他也许是要帮我开门012---Maybe he was going to open the door.
但是我完全误会了  所以我就012---But I totally misread him and I, uh...
你亲了上去012---You kissed him?
我又没有别的办法012---I didn't know what else to do!
你可以试着012---Well, you could have tried...
别去亲他012---...not kissing him.
钱德  真是多谢你012---Thanks, Chandler.
瑞秋  拉夫罗伦的人来电  要你去第二关面试012---Hey, Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called. You got a second interview.
不敢相信  我还能去第二关面试  对啊012---I can't believe it! I got a second interview. Yes!
我看那一吻没那么糟嘛012---That kiss isn't looking like such a mistake now, is it?
慢着  他要我回去面试  不是因为那一吻吧012---Wait a minute, wait. You don't think that's why he wants me back?
是啊012---Yeah!
不是吗012---No?
吻  你们在说什么吻012---Kiss? What are you talking about?
我在面试中  意外地亲了考官012---Ugh, I accidentally kissed him in the interview...
他现在还要我回去012---...and now he wants me back y'know of course...
"把那逢人便亲的女孩带来"012---...because, "Let's bring back the girl who kisses everybody"!
瑞秋  你别乱想了012---Come on, Rach.
天啊  万一他觉得我是那种随便跟他上床的人怎么办012---Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that'll just sleep with him?
他要你回去面试  或许是因为你适合那工作012---He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
或许吧  我不知道  天啊  我怎么会那么蠢012---Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God! How could I be so stupid?
瑞秋  快别那么说了  乔伊给你个抱抱就好012---Oh, Rachel, look, don't say that.I think you just need a hug from Joey. Heh.
来  来呀012---Come on. Come on, ha-ha-ha.
她回来了  辣妹回来了012---She's back! Hot girl's back!
还不完全是  但是谢谢你012---Aw, well, I'm not totally back yet. but thank you.
不是说你  是罗斯那栋的辣妹  她回来了012---No, in Ross' building. She's back! She's back!
等一下  我  马上过去012---Okay, wait there. I'll be over in a second.
一  二  三  知道了012---One, two, three. Got it!
我来看看她有多辣012---I gotta check out this hot girl.
辣妹在这里012---There she is!
可恶  你搬家啦012---Damn it! Did you move?
是啊012---Yes.
我跟你们住了一阵子  然后搬到了这里012---I lived with you guys for a while. Then I found this place.
我是罗斯012---I'm Ross.
有什么事012---Yes?
你家里有住辣妹吗012---Do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
没有  我一个人住012---No, I'm all alone.
是啊  我很遗憾012---Yeah. Sorry about that.
小女孩  你好012---Oh. Hey, little girl.
你妈妈  姊姊或是褓姆  有没有谁正好是辣妹012---Is your mommy or sister or babysitter by any chance, a hot girl?
爹地  下次再聊012---Daddy! Later, girl! Aah.
真要命012---Oh, man!
辣妹012---Hot girl?
辣妹012---Hot girl!
嗨  瑞秋  请进  好012---Hi, Rachel. Come on in. Hi. Okay.
很高兴再次见到你  谢谢012---Ahem. It's nice to see you again. Thank you.
瑞秋012---Oh, Rachel, uh...
什么012---What? .
那上面012---Just, uh..
你说什么  我来帮你012---Excuse me? Yeah, let me...
好  我知道是怎么回事了  听着012---Whoa, eh, oh!All right. Okay, I see what's going on here. Now, listen, look...
抱歉让你误会了012---...I am sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
但我不是那种随便的女孩  为了工作出卖肉体012---But I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead.
虽然我亲过你  你也没有权利012---Even though I kissed you, that does not give you...
要我跟你上床  这份工作我也没有那么想要012---...the right to demand sex from me! I do not want this job that bad.
再会  先生012---Good day, sir.
说了你们一定不信012---Ugh, you are not gonna believe...
拉夫罗伦的那个杂碎对我做了什么012---...what that sleazeball from Ralph Lauren did to me.
不可思议  你们怎么知道012---Okay, that's amazing. How did you know that?
你嘴唇上沾到墨水012---You got ink on your lip.
喔012---Oh.
改天让我拿拿你的枪如何012---What do you say, maybe, sometime I hold your gun?
不知道  照理说不能那样012---I don't know. We're not supposed to do that.
又不会怎样012---What could happen? I mean...
我看答案是  不行012---Yeah. I'm gonna say no.
菲比  晚餐后要去看电影吗  不行  我们已经有计划了012---Phoebe, do you want to see a movie after dinner tonight? Oh, we can't. We already have plans.
你们要去干嘛012---What are you doing?
就跟每天一样啊  腻在盖瑞的公寓里012---Um, well, same thing we did all day. Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
他好厉害  我们都没离开过卧室012---He is so amazing. We never left the bedroom.
祝你们看电影愉快012---But have fun at the movie.
我们不是要去看电影012---Uh, ha, ha. Well, we're not seeing a movie.
不去  那你干嘛问我们要不要去012---You're not? Why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
我想知道你做什么  是因为012---Oh, um, because I just wanted to know what you were doing...
我怕你不小心闯进我房问  因为我和钱德012---...so y'know walk in on me and Chandler...
会做上一整晚的012---...while we were, y'know,doing it all night.
失陪以下  好吗012---Will you excuse me just a second? Okay. Yeah.
钱德  方便私下说几句话吗  好012---Chandler? Can I see you for a second? Uh, yeah.
我们定要打败他们  为什么012---We have got to beat them! Why?
因为盖瑞和菲比  觉得他们比我们还火热012---Because Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are.
所以呢  所以012---Oh! So? So?
所以我们上楼去大干一场  证明他们是错的012---So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
摩妮卡  你别再比来比去了  这真是太疯狂了012---Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing. It's crazy.
只为了让盖瑞和菲比难看  我们就要上楼大战数十回合012---Just to impress Gary and Phoebe.you want me to go upstairs and have sex over and over.
我干嘛说不  快去拿外套012---...and I'm saying no to this why? Get your coat!
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
借过012---Excuse me.
你们应该看一看  通知其他的住户012---You should check this out. Tell the other tenants.
这家伙一直在找什么辣妹的012---Apparently, he's running around looking for some kind of hot girl.
谁不是呢012---Who isn't?
我们可能还没见过  我是罗斯012---I don't think we've met. I'm Ross.
我知道  你就是那个不愿意分担工友费的人012---I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
算了012---Never mind.
不  其实我觉得大家的反应不公平012---No, I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.
因为你才刚搬进来而已嘛012---I mean, you had just moved in.
我是刚搬进来而已012---I had just moved in!
谢谢你012---Thank you!
等等012---Listen, um...
我是珍  珍012---Jen. Jen.
这听来可能有点012---I know this may sound a little:
不如哪天一起喝杯咖啡012---But, uh, would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime?
当然  没问题012---Sure, that would be nice.
上面有我的电话  打给我012---My number's on there. Give me a call.
我一定打012---I will give you a call. Heh.
那后会有期  好012---I'll see you later. Okay.
我忘记拿报纸了012---I forgot my paper.
刚才真是太棒了012---That was amazing. Ugh.
等到吃晚饭的时候  我一定要说给菲比和盖瑞听012---Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
刚才真是太棒了012---That was amazing.
我们才是热恋第一名012---We are the hottest, huh?
没人比我们更热恋012---No one is hotter than we are.
我们是最棒的  不  最棒的是你012---We're the best. No, you're the best.
不  你才是  不  你才是012---No, you're the best. No, you're the best.
我是最棒的012---I am the best.
两位012---Hey, guys.
你们刚才在干嘛啊012---What you been doing?
嘿  乔伊  那不是前几天  跟你挥手的女孩吗012---Hey, Joey, isn't that the girl who waved at you the other day?
不知道  但你的床单是透明的012---I don't know, but I can see through your sheet.
对  是她  没错012---Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
不过算了吧  我无缘跟她见面  为什么012---But you know what? It doesn't matter.I'm never gonna meet her anyways. Why?
因为我找不到她的公寓012---Because it's impossible to find her apartment!
她就像是住在  辣妹黑洞里012---She lives in some hot-girl parallel universe or something.
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
她明明就住在二楼  左边数过来第七间012---She lives on the 2nd floor, 7th apartment from the left.
才不是  她住在三楼  左边数过来第八间012---No, no, no, she lives on the 3rd floor, 8th apartment from the left.
才怪  前两个窗户是大厅的012---No. Those first two windows, that's the lobby.
过去那边的是楼梯间窗户  你数错了012---And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
我之前不知道  摩妮卡  谢谢你012---I did not know that! Thank you, Monica.
不敢相信我因为数数  差点就失去了另一个女孩012--- I can't believe，I almost lost another girl because of counting!
你好了吗  好了  我去拿外套  好的012---So, uh, you ready? Yeah, I'll just get my coat. Okay.
你能帮我去开门吗  没问题012---Could you get that? Sure.
乔伊012---Joey...?
不  不012---Aah! No! No!
首先  我要谢谢你  同意再次见我012---Uh, first, I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
不要紧012---That's, uh, quite all right.
但我有义务告诉你  这次的面试有录影存证012---But I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
好  首先我要向你道歉  我不小心亲了你012---Okay. Um.Well, first, I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you...
还有  对你大吼的那件事012---...and, uh, for yelling at you.
很合理012---Fair enough.
你或许还会想要雇用012---Now, you're probably going to hire one of the people who, uh...
不曾  不曾012---Who did... Who did not, um, ahem...
对你大吼或是夺门而出的人012---...yell at you and storm out.
不过那样可就大错特错了  原因是这样的012---And I think that's a big mistake. And here's why.
我大出洋相之后  还敢回来  这说明我有勇气012---I made a huge fool of myself, and I came back. That shows courage.
我以为你要我用性来交换工作  当时我拒绝了012---When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no.
这表示我有骨气012---That shows integrity.
我不害怕挺身为自己辩护012---And I was not afraid to stand up for myself...
这表示我有勇气012---...and that shows courage.
我知道  我已经说过勇气了012---Okay, ahem.Now, I know that I've already said courage...
不过勇气总是多多益善嘛012---...but you've got to have courage.
最后当我以为你  想趁工作之便占我便宜012---And, um, finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace...
我拒绝了  但是没打算告你012---...I said no, and I was not litigious.
所以你看  我有勇气012---So there you go. You got courage...
有骨气  双重勇气012---...you got integrity, you got courage again...
而且又不告你012---...and not litigious.
您是012---Look, Mr...
塞纳  塞纳  我知道012---Zelner. Zelner! I knew that.
我知道012---I knew that!
我真的很想要这份工作012---I really, really want this job.
我想我一定会做得很好012---And I think I would be really good at it.
这样吧012---You know what?
虽然我可能会后悔012---I may regret this, but, uh...
但我要让你试试看012---...I'm gonna give you a shot.
你要  真的012---Oh, you are? Really?
谢谢你  喔  老天012---Oh, thank you. Oh, God!
我现在抱你会不会很不得体012---Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
会  那好吧012---Yes. Okay.
握手可以吗012---Well, how about a handshake? Ha-ha-ha.
天啊  对不起012---Aah! Oh, God! I'm sorry!
我不是故意要摸那个的  摸你012---Oh, God, I did not mean to touch that! I mean, you!
我是说  那里012---There! Uh, there. Um...
好吧012---Okay, so, thank you.
那谢谢你  我先离开  非常感谢012---I'm gonna leave. Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
那就星期一见了012---Hey, I'll see you Monday.
钱德  你累了012---You tired Chandler?
今天疯成那样  他不累才怪012---You better believe he's tired, after the day we had!
如果你们懂的话  你们懂吧012---If you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean?
亲爱的  连墨西哥脆片都懂012---Honey? The tortilla chips know what you mean.
钱德  我给你的警徽还喜欢吗012---So, uh, Chandler, do you like that badge I got you?
喜欢  很酷012---Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
宾警官得要先行告退  执行10一100勤务012---Now, I gotta go. Officer Bing's got a 10-100.
去尿尿012---That's pee-pee.
菲比  你头发里有树枝012---Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.
来这里的路上 我们绕了一点路012---We kind of took a detour on our way over here.
对  我们去公园里散步 看四下无人就012---we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
不会吧  真的有012---You didn't. We did!
我们违反了犯罪条例  第12条第7款012---Ha, ha. We violated section 12, paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
在公园  是吧012---The park, huh? Ha, ha.
公共场所012---Public place. Uh-huh.
我听到了  失陪一下012---I hear you. Can you excuse me for a second?
嗨  钱德012---Hi, Chandler.
摩妮卡  这是男厕012---Monica, this is the men's room.
没错吧012---Isn't it?
没错012---Yes, it is.
我一直都觉得男厕很性感  你不觉得吗012---But see, I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
  不觉得012---No.
否则我们就不会在一起了012---And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out.
得了吧  这越搞越离谱了012---This is getting ridiculous.
别这样  我们不能让他们赢012---Come on, we can't let them win! Uh...
我们已经证明我们在热恋了  为何你走火入魔成这样012---Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
因为菲比和盖瑞012---Phoebe and Gary are in that
不仅难分难舍  还在公园里做了那档子事012---"can't keep their hands off each other" phase!
所以呢  所以呢012---So? So.
所以我很难过  因为我们激情不再了012---It makes me really sad that we're not really there anymore.
原来是为了这档事012---Oh, is that what this has all been about?
我们成天腻在一起的那时012---Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were, you know...
不是让人兴奋吗012---...all over each other all the time?
对啊  那时很棒  真的很棒012---Yeah, that was great. That was really great.
但是老实跟你说  我们现在的状况让我更兴奋012---But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are now.
真的  是啊012---Really? Yeah.
我从没谈过这么久的恋爱012---I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.
过了刚开始的激情期了  还想跟对方相处在一起012---Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, 
我觉得这是很不平凡的012---I think that's pretty incredible.
而且还是和你在一起012---And the fact that this is all happening with you...
这让我很兴奋012---...I think that's pretty exciting.
真甜012---That's so sweet.
我知道我表现得有点过火012---I know that I was acting a little crazy...
但是我的感觉跟你一样  真的012---...but I feel the same way. Mm?
你知道我刚领悟到什么吗012---You know what I just realized?
我们的关系让你惊慌012---You just freaked out about our relationship.
才没有  就是有  承认吧012---Pfft, I did not. Yes, you did!
你很惊慌012---Admit it. You freaked out!
好啦  我是有一点惊慌012---I freaked out a little.
岂止有一点  你超级惊慌的012---A little? You freaked out bigtime, okay?
是我救你的  我们角色互换了012---And I fixed it! We have switched places.
我现在是国王  你是搞砸又发疯的输家012---I am the relationship king, and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!
现在又回到原位了012---And now we're back.
没想到罗斯还真的相信012---I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
谢天谢地  我再也看不下去了012---Thank God. I can't watch him anymore. Ha-ha-ha.
你们准备好去看电影没有  好了012---You guys ready for the movies? Yeah.
对了  多谢你把潘蜜拉和洁丝敏借给我们012---Oh, by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
要命  她们还真是看不腻012---Man, they cannot get enough!
好了  选张卡  好012---Okay, Pick a card. Okay.
现在  记住花色号码012---All right. Now memorize it.
好了没  好了012---You got it? Oh, yes.
好  是这张吗012---Okay. Is that your card?
就是这张012---Yes. Ha, ha.
嘿  大家好  嗨012---Hey, guys. Hi there.
你们猜怎么着  班要上电视拍广告了012---Guess what. Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.
你们在说什么  还没有定案012---What are you talking about? Well, it's not for sure.
不过  我们在公园里遇到一个人  他觉得班很可爱012---But, uh, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute.
当然  这也是事实啦012---You know, which he is.
所以那个人留了张名片  要我带班去参加广告试镜012---Um, anyhoo, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
这个人是本地最大的选角导演012---Whoa.The guy's like the biggest commercial casting director in town.
班去公园随便散个步  就有试镜自动送上门012---Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition?
我是说  班  真有你的012---I mean, way to go, Ben!
那个公园我都去烂了  却从来没人主动找我去试镜012---Man, I've been in that park a million times. No one's ever offered me an audition.
我知道  真的很神奇  我们只是在陪班玩荡秋千012---I know, it's crazy. We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
我每次都玩荡秋千啊012---I'm always on the swings.
我是哪里做错了012---What am I doing wrong?
就是荡秋千那里012---That.
老友记  第五季  第18集  瑞秋开始吸烟012---Friends  S05E18  The One Where Rachel Smokes
好  我要出门了  祝我好运  祝好运012---Okay, gotta go. Wish me luck. Good luck.
瑞秋  既然你在罗夫罗兰工作   能不能带几件马球衫回来012---Hey, Rach, now that you working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
什么啊  第一天上班就偷公司东西  我可能下不了手喔012---Uh, well, you know what? I don't know if I'd feel comfortable stealing on my very first day.
不愿意慷公司之慨012---Unwilling to steal from work.
有意思了012---Interesting.
当然  就算有人能拿免费的  那也非我莫属012---Besides, if anybody is gonna get free stuff, it's me.
好了  各位  祝我好运吧012---Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.
祝你好运  给他们好看012---Good luck! Go get 'em!
好了  来讨论帮瑞秋庆生的事012---Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday.
我建议在这周末搞个惊喜派对012---I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
可是一个月后  才是她生日啊012---Whoa, whoa. But her birthday's not for another month.
是  没错  但在生日当天开派对  那就不惊喜啦012---Okay, but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
我觉得这主意不错012---I think that's a great idea.
我们办个晚宴派对  邀请好朋友过来012---We can have a dinner party and invite her close friends.
罗斯  我们要帮瑞秋办惊喜派对喽012---Ross. We're having a surprise party for Rachel.
好  搞定012---Okay. Done.
好  那你要一起办吗  乐意之至012---Okay, great. So do you wanna do it together? I would love to do it together.
她们要一起来啦012---They're gonna do it together.
兄弟  那位可是我女友012---Dude, that's my girlfriend.
所以我就得闭嘴012---So I gotta shut it down now?
好  我得走了012---All right, I gotta take off. 
我要接班  然后去参加大试镜012---I'm picking up Ben and then we're off to the big audition.
看到有演员假装是班的父亲  那种感觉一定很怪012---It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
是啊  能怪过看到班的两个妈妈温存吗012---Yeah. Weirder than his two moms making out?
爸爸  广告里面有爸爸012---Whoa, whoa. Dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
是啊  班和爸爸喝汤  演得很陶醉的样子012---Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
或许我可以跟你们一起去  搞不好能试镜演那个爸爸012---Well, maybe I'll go with you and see if I can audition as the dad.
说到扮演班的爸爸  由我这教父上场最适合了012---I mean, who better to play Ben's father than his godfather?
你不是班的教父  什么012---You're not his godfather. What?
你在开玩笑吧012---Are you kidding?
当然是啊012---Of course I am.
我们走吧  教父  好啊012---Okay, let's go, godfather. All right. Ha, ha.
嘿  我通过了  他们让我试镜012---Hey, I'm in. They're gonna let me audition.
真的  太棒了012---Really? That's great.
我知道  有个女的看过我演的舞台剧  所以我离她离得远远的012---I know, I know. One of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play. So I steered clear of her.
那个孩子看起来很眼熟012---That kid looks familiar.
是啊  他拍过一堆广告012---Yeah, he's done tons of commercials.
有糖果广告  新力游戏机012---I've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...
还帮电话公司拍过广告012---...and that one for the phone company.
他演得实在是太好了  我索性跟着换了电话公司012---In fact, he was so good in that one. He actually convinced me to switch phone companies.
钱德因此还气得半死012---Chandler was mad.
不过  他这次休想拿到这角色  因为班比他可爱多了012---Yeah, well, he's not gonna get this one. All right? Ben is way cuter than that kid.
看就知道  宝贝  看看你012---I mean, look at him.
很好  不过若我能演班的爸爸  这样是不是很棒012---That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great if I got to play Ben's dad?
乔伊  你跟班一点都不像012---Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
比你跟他像多了012---I look more like him than you do.
我跟你还不熟  哪里生得出小孩012---Well, I really don't know you well enough for you to do that.
现在是最后的二选一012---So it's down to these two.
南西  我知道你喜欢这一个  我也有同感012---Nancy, I know you like this one and I think I agree.
瑞秋  你觉得呢012---Rachel, what do you think?
那个是很漂亮012---Well, um, that one is pretty...
但我更喜欢这个的质感  抱歉了012---...but I just love this fabric. Sorry.
不用抱歉  你的职责之一就是多出好点子012---Oh, don't be sorry. That's part of your job here, to give your opinions.
功劳归我  开玩笑的012---And then I take credit for them. I'm kidding. Ha, ha.
她这次是在开玩笑  下次别再跟她有不同意见了012---She is kidding. But don't ever disagree with her again.
这次换我在开玩笑012---Okay, now I'm kidding. Oh, ha, ha.
真是有趣的办公室012---Oh, what a fun office.
我不知道要选哪一个  不过先来根烟倒是真的012---I don't know which one. But I do know I need a cigarette.
不如我们出去休息一下  等回来之后再解决012---So, what do you say we take a break, go outside and figure this out when we come back.
瑞秋  嗯012---Rachel?  Yeah.
你抽烟吗  不抽012---You smoke? No.
我爸是医生  老跟我说些恐怖的故事012---My dad's a doctor. And he would always tell me just horror stories...
说那些鬼神精灵的012---About ghosts and goblins...
完全赞同公主抽烟的权利012---...who totally supported the princess' right to smoke.
她们在抽烟的时候  就背着我做出了决定012---And then they came back from smoking and they'd made all of the decisions without me.
这样不太公平  我知道啊012---That doesn't seem fair. I know.
我不同流合污还被处罚  抽烟可是恶心又伤身的习惯012---It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisonous habit.
对  抽烟最棒了012---Yeah, it is the best.
万一  这种事没完没了怎么办012---I mean, what if this keeps happening?
她们在外头抽烟做决定012---Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions...
我只能在办公室里  呼吸愚蠢的新鲜空气012---...and I'll just be up in my office breathing in my stupid clean air.
到时候等阿金要升我们的职  你们想她会选谁012---You know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us,who do you think she's gonna pick?
  是我还是乌烟瘴气的冒烟女012---Me or Smokey Smokerson?
瑞秋  你也可以一起去  不用抽烟  就说要去透透气012---Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke.Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
对  这我做得到012---Yeah, I could do that.
简单一点的就是  一起抽烟012---Yeah, or you could just do the easy thing and smoke.
嘿  瑞秋  要去喝咖啡吗  嘿012---Hey. Rachel，Do you wanna go get coffee? Hey.
乐意之至  好012---Oh, I would love to. Oh, good.
宝贝  我也想起去  好啊012---I'm gonna go too, babe. Oh, good.
等等  我变卦了012---Oh, I changed my mind.
好  来讨论派对的事  我有一大堆点子012---Okay, let's talk about the party. I have so many ideas.
我也是012---Ooh, me too. Oh!
耶  真是壮观啊012---Yeah! Oh, look at that.
好  这是蛋糕的素描图012---All right. This is a little sketch of the cake. Uh-huh. Wow.
还有一些菜单的样本012---See? Um, some sample menus.
不如用异国小点心当餐前菜012---Um, you know, I thought we'd start with a Tuscan-style finger food.
至于音乐嘛  这是我收藏的CD的字母列表012---Okay. And for music, here's an alphabetized list of all of my CDs.
跟食物超级搭配的还都做了记号012---I've highlighted the ones that'll go really good with the food.
不是说要亲密的晚餐派对吗  现在不那样做了012---What happened to the intimate dinner party? Oh, we're not doing that.
好  那么  好012---Okay? So... Wow. All right.
看来你全包办了  多谢"共同"主办人012---Looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.
怎么了  我没有一手包办啊  你要做的事还有很多012---Wait. I didn't take care of everything.there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
举个例子012---Uh-huh? Like what?
杯子012---Cups.
杯子  你让我准备杯子012---Cups. You're giving me cups?
还有冰块012---And ice.
杯子和冰块  我可以负责杯子和冰块012---Cups and ice? Oh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?
好吧012---All right.
行  我就负责杯子和冰块012---Fine. Okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice.
等等  冰块可以从餐厅拿012---Wait, I can get ice at the restaurant...
冰块是我的012---I got it! Mine!
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
试镜顺利吗  不太顺利012---How did the audition go? Not so good.
慢着  你在学乔伊那招吗012---Wait a minute. Are you doing Joey's:
“试镜不太顺利" 012---"The audition didn't go so well."
事实上  很顺利对吧012---Yeah, it did!
没错012---Yeah, I am!
班取得了第二次试镜的资格  太好了012---Yeah, Ben got a second audition. Oh, great.
对  是我让罗斯那样沮丧的  因为我没有过关012---Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
你也过关了  对吧012---You got a callback too, didn't you?
没错012---Yeah, I did!
瑞秋  你怎么会来这里012---Hey, Rachel. What are you doing out here?
里头有点无聊  我就想来这里透透新鲜空气012---You know, it got kind of lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
南西和我正好讨论到秋装  太好了012---We were talking about the fall collection. Oh, great.
所以  这是要012---So anyway, we really...
抱歉  瞧你被我们熏的  没关系012---I'm sorry. We're smoking all over you. That's okay.
不  不  你待着  我们走012---No, no, no. We'll move. You stay there.
总之我把设计寄给罗夫  他很喜欢012---I sent the designs to Ralph. He was excited about it.
太好了  你是最棒的012---That's great. You are the best.
不好意思  能借支烟吗012---Excuse me. Can I bum one of those?
这个就好012---Y'know what, actually this one's...
你们在聊什么好笑的012---Okay, okay, okay. What's so funny over here?
我还以为你不抽烟的012---I thought you didn't smoke.
我以为你们是说抽大麻烟012---You know, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes.
知道我的意思吗  像瘾君子那样012---You know what I mean? Like, doobies?
事实上  我还纳闷儿  "你们是疯了不成"012---Actually, I thought to myself, "Those guys are crazy."
没有啦  其实  普通香烟我一直爱抽012---But no, actually, I smoke the regular ones all the time.
我们会抽大麻012---We get high.
我也是012---Me too.
我说笑的012---I'm kidding. Oh!
我也是012---Me too.
老天  这真是折磨人  你是怎么习惯的012---Oh, God. This is so nerve-racking. How do you do this?
我过关的经验不多  所以012---Well, fortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
我们在试镜之后被留下来  这是好现象吗012---Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
天知道012---Who knows?
最后入围的是雷蒙  班  凯尔和乔伊012---Okay. We have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey.
其余的人辛苦了  谢谢012---The rest of you, thank you very much.
好呀  我就知道012---Yes! I knew it!
再见012---Ah. Bye-bye.
再会012---So long.
后会有期012---Later.
太棒了  我有可能饰演班的爸爸012---This is great. I might actually get to play Ben's dad.
其实  那是不可能的012---Actually, that can't happen.
因为你们各自的长相都不同012---Because you all have such different looks...
所以我们把你和雷蒙配对  凯尔和班是一组012---...we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
所以最后只有一组会出线012---So it'll either be you two or you two.
要命012---Oh, man.
这样就有点尴尬了  真的是012---This is gonna be kind of weird. Yeah, it is.
对  一定会很尴尬012---Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
因为我们是最好的朋友  所以才会尴尬012---No. We're like best friends. That's why it's weird.
原来如此  我只是搭腔而已012---I thought we were just talking.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我能把这些东西放这里  等着给瑞秋过生日吗012---Is it okay if I leave this stuff here till Rachel's birthday party?
当然可以  里头是什么  杯子012---Uh, sure. What's in them? Um, cups.
那好  因为我们替瑞秋  准备了八百加仑的水012---Oh, good, because we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
老实说  这些杯子还真不少012---Seriously, that's a lot of cups.
对  这是因为我负责杯子和冰块012---Yeah, well, that's 'cause in charge of cups and ice,
摩妮卡在这一天将后悔莫及  因为她要我负责杯子和冰块012---And Monica's gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
我也后悔过一次  除了后悔没做别的012---You know, I rued the day once. Didn't get a whole lot else done.
好吧  该把其他杯子搬上来了012---Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.
嘿  乔伊  嘿  菲比012---Hey, Joey. Hey, Pheebs.
嘿  罗斯  你在这里正好012---Hey. Ross, good, I'm glad you're here.
我有事要跟你说  怎么了012---I want to talk to you about something. Oh. What's up?
我一直在想这次拍广告的事012---Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing.
我和班硬碰硬  捉对厮杀012---You know me against Ben. The two of us competing.
这样比怎么都不会有好结果  所以012---Well, that can't lead to anything good. So, 
我想我还是退出好了  告诉他们我不去试镜012---I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
乔伊  太好了  多谢012---Wow. Uh...Joey, that's great. Thanks, man.
就这样012---That's it?
你真的要让我这样做  这事关我的职业生涯啊012---You're gonna let me do this? This is my career we're talking about here.
可是你说  我是要你说出让班退出012---But you just I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it.
罗斯  如果真有人要退出  那也应该是班012---Look, Ross, if anyone should step aside, it should be Ben.
什么  钱德  告诉他为什么012---What? Chandler, tell him.
我先去开门012---Well, let me get the door first.
没有人  你好012---Oh, hi, no one.
为什么班应该退出012---Why should Ben step aside?
这原本就是他的试镜012---It was his audition in the first place.
你是跟过去的  就像是跟班老爹012---You just tagged along. You're like the tag-along dad.
起码我有顾虑到班的感受012---At least I care about his feelings.
什么012---What?
你知道万一他没通过试镜  到时他会有多难过吗012---Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
那他又为什么不会通过012---And why wouldn't he get it?
得了吧  你有没有看过  跟我同组的小子有多厉害012---Oh, come on.Have you seen what my kid can do? Huh?
他会拨电话  吃墨西哥脆片012---I mean, he dials phones, he eats tortilla chips.
还会凭空踢足球演对手戏呢012---He plays soccer with the cartoon tiger.
你是说你的那个小子能喝汤  比我儿子厉害012---Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
你只是给他一根汤匙罢了012---You just give him a spoon, baby.
是吗  我们走着瞧  好啊012---Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see. Yeah.
这支广告片的主角  非我和米契莫属012---Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch.
你的孩子叫做雷蒙  对  你的也是012---Your kid's name is Raymond. Yeah? So is yours.
有没有用  很棒012---How did work go? Oh, it was great. It was great.
我听你们的建议  去她们抽烟的地方012---I went down there just like you said.
我们讨论到了生意  阿金完全接受我的意见012---And we talked business. And Kim totally took my opinions.
你浑身烟味012---You stink.
多谢  我是说真的012---Thanks. No, I'm serious.
因为那里的人全都在抽烟012---That's because I went down there and they were smoking.
这其实是成功的味道012---This is actually the smell of success.
不过有点怪怪的  天啊  你有抽烟012---But there's something different, though.Oh, my God. You smoked.
我没有  才怪012---I did not. Yes, you did.
你看起来像又生病又快乐  你一定有抽烟012---You look happy and sick. You smoked.
好啦  我是有抽  为了事业不得已嘛012---All right, fine. But I had to. I had to do it for my career.
真希望我也可以  为了事业这么做012---I wish I had to smoke for my career.
这样很恶心啊012---That's so gross.
没那么糟吧012---Well, no, it's not that bad, you know?
虽然舌头有点打结  手指也有点怪味012---I mean, yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and my fingers sort of smell.
其实我感觉快吐了012---I actually feel like I could throw up.
好  但你一定要撑过这一关  再来就会是快乐无比了012---But you gotta push past this, okay? Because it's about to get so good.
钱德012---Chandler.
我给你说  你浑身的烟味  我得出去透透气了012---I have to tell you, you smell so smoky, I have to get up.
我没骗你012---I'm not kidding.
我觉得你闻起来很香012---I think you smell great.
所以大家都同意了  不要格子图案  要粉红012---So we're decided. No on plaid, yes on pink.
完全正确012---Absolutely.
我举双手双脚赞成012---I'm so onboard.
瑞秋   这支烟不是才刚点吗012---Rachel, didn't you just light that?
是啊  但是你知道吗  我正在努力少抽烟012---Yeah. But you know what? I'm just really, really trying to cut back, you know.
瑞秋  我等着看笑话012---Good luck, Rach.
其实我最近有想要戒烟012---I've actually been thinking about quitting.
我每周日晚上  都告诉自己要戒烟012---Oh, well, sure. Every Sunday night, I tell myself I'm quitting.
结果周一还不是狂抽猛抽012---Every Monday morning, it's like:
还用你说012---Tell me about it.
那就戒了吧  我们一起戒烟012---Well, let's quit. We'll just quit. Let's all quit.
听起来是很诱人啦012---It does sound appealing.
我戒烟从没成功过  你可以的  一定行012---I never could do it. But you could. You can. Absolutely.
我们可以互相帮忙012---We can help each other out.
用那个什么戒烟贴布的  我们能组成戒烟三姊妹012---We could get those patches. We could be like the Patch Sisters.
其实我们真的应该戒烟  好吧  一起来戒烟012---You know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit.
好  太棒了  把香烟给我  来  通通交出来012---Yes. Great. Give me those cigs. Come on. Give it. Give it. Out. Done. Quit. Whoo!
那个打火机是我前夫送我的012---My late husband gave me that lighter.
我没在开玩笑012---I'm not kidding.
那好吧012---Okay, then. Okay.
汤012---Mm, soup.
汤012---Mm, soup.
汤012---Mm, soup.
乔伊  罗斯随时会到012---Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second.
我去上个厕所  帮我看一下班  好吗012---would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
好啊  没问题  谢谢012---Yeah, no problem. Thanks.
嗨  班012---Hi, Ben.
你想当演员啊012---So you want to be an actor, huh?
告诉你  演戏可不像野餐012---Well, I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.
有碰不完的钉子012---There's tons of rejection.
一点都不稳定012---No stability.
前一天  你还是德瑞克医生012---I mean, one day, you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.

不过还好了  没关系  没关系012---But that's okay. No problem. No problem.
面汤012---Mm, noodle soup.
你那样不错  不过台词是 "汤"012---You know, that's fine. But the line is, "Mm, soup."
那我刚才说什么  面汤012---Oh. What'd I say? Mm, noodle soup.

瑞秋  我们想尝试着戒烟  但实在是太难了012---Rachel, we tried to quit. But it was too hard.
你们开始抽烟  起码也该告诉我一声嘛012---Well, y'know, if you started smoking again, you could have at least told me.
拜托  快给我来支  刚才说到哪里012---Come on, give me one of those. What are we talking about?
不行  你戒烟很成功  不许放弃012---No, you're doing great. Don't give up.
所以我们才没跟你说  我们不想拖你下水012---That's why we didn't tell you, and we are not gonna drag you down with us.
等等  别这样  拖我下水012---Oh, wait. No, no. Drag me down. Drag me down.
瑞秋  千万不行  你戒烟成功  我们都替你骄傲012---Forget it, Rachel. We're both so proud of how well you're doing.
我不能让你前功尽弃012---I'm not gonna let you blow it.
若被我查到你有带烟  我一定炒你鱿鱼012---In fact, if I catch you, you're fired.
走吧  离开这里  走啊  我不要你吸二手烟  走啊012---So go on, get out of here. Go on. I don't want you breathing this stuff. Go on.

菲比  你对杯子还真有一套012---Great job with the cups, Pheebs. Ha, ha.
你干脆跟她去约会算了012---Why don't you just go out with her?
你有没有注意到冰012---Did you notice the ice? Look.
各式各样的都有  有碎冰  冰块还有干冰  注意看012---We have it all. We have crushed, cubed and dry. Watch.
很有神秘感吧012---Mystical.
没人想吃我的小点心  他们全跑去吃菲比的雪花冰012---Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
有雪花冰012---There are snow cones?

不  乔伊  我是真的很遗憾012---No, really. I am, Joey. I feel bad.
罗斯  你用不着遗憾012---Well, look, Ross. You don't have to, okay?
是我自己太差  怨不得你012---It's not your fault I suck.
连〝面汤"都说不好  还算哪门子的演员012---What kind of an actor can't even say, "Mm, noodle soup"?
你知道吗  或许你搞砸了试镜  不是因为你差012---Hey, you know what? Maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck.
或许你演砸了试镜  是因为你更在意你的"教子"012---Maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson.
什么意思  我认为  在潜意识里012---What do you mean? I think, subconsciously...
等等  我听不懂012---Whoa, you lost me.
我是觉得在某种程度上012---I think, on some level,
你故意演砸了自己的试镜012---you sabotaged your own audition
是为了让班拿到那个角色012---so Ben would get the part.
你的说法让我感觉舒服多了012---Well, your way sounds a lot better than mine.
对012---Yeah.
对啊  不是我演技烂  不是012---Yeah. It's not that I'm a bad actor. No.
只是我  太关心小班的成长了012---No, it's just that, uh, I care so damn much about little Ben...
看到他成功  对我来说更重要012---...that, uh, it was more important for me to see him succeed.
就是这样  谢谢你  谢谢你012---There you go. Thank you. Thank you.
那他拿到角色没  没有012---So did he get it? No.
那确实没办法了012---Ah, what are you gonna do?
不好意思  瑞秋葛林在吗  我跟她约了吃中饭012---Oh, hi. Excuse me. Is Rachel Green here? I'm supposed to meet her for lunch.
她现在不会来这里了  请到10楼找她012---Oh, she doesn't come down anymore. You can find her up on 10.
好012---Okay, great.
我们昨天中饭聊到提案报告  他担心一个人出差不够看012---So we talked about the  whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough  to get a take on the trip
我说 "绝对没问题"012---And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."
后会有期了012---I'll catch you guys later.

嗨  钱德  凯特琳  新发型喔012---Hi, Chandler. Hey, Caitlin.Somebody got a haircut.
我恨死了  活像八岁小男孩012---Ugh. I hate it. I look like an 8-year-old boy.
如果真的是这样  那以前上体育课就会相当有趣了012---If that was true, gym class would've been  a lot more interesting.
正好27美元  好  给你012---It's, uh, $27 even. Oh, okay. Here you go.
嘿  你的鸡呢  在后头  被这鸭子气跑了012---Where's the chicken? Oh, it's in the back. The duck pissed him off.
鸭子说先有蛋  才有鸡012---He said that eggs came first.
谢了  下回见  好  再见012---Ha, ha, thanks. I'll see you later. Okay. Bye.
你那样算是什么  什么012---What the hell was that? What?
打情骂俏012---The flirting.
你不是正要去  跟谁来着012---Aren't you supposed to be going out with, hmm, let's see,
跟我妹妹约会吗012---my sister?
我没在打情骂俏啊  那根本就是打情骂俏012---I was not flirting. It was totally flirting!
"新发型喔"012---"Somebody got a haircut "
好  第一件事  你模仿得太差012---First of all, the impression? Uncanny.
第二  那不是打情骂俏  只是两个人闲话家常而已012---And second, that wasn't flirting. That was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
我听你在说012---Oh! Yeah, right.
你要看打情骂俏吗  我示范给你看012---You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
算了  不用了012---I'm good. I'm okay.

我真替乔伊感到骄傲012---I am so proud of Joey.
他竟然要演《法网游龙》  我知道012---He's gonna be on Law and Order! I know.
可是你不觉得  叫《网法游龙》比较对吗012---But don't you think it should be called Order and Law?
不对  得先有法律才能去网啊012---No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
我话匣子一开可就没完了012---Yeah. Don't get me started on that.
我没在打情骂俏啊  还在纪念日当天  丢脸012---I was not flirting. And on your anniversary. For shame!
怎么了  钱德跟外送的辣妹打情骂俏012---What's going on? Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl.
我才没有  拜托你也小声点012---I was not. And oh, God! Shh!
很抱歉  但有就是有012---I'm sorry, but you were.
而且就算有  谁要跟她搭讪  也应该是个单身的男人012---Okay? And besides, if anyone should be hitting on her ..it's the guy who's single
也应该是个有搞头的人嘛012---the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
看来有人想钓彼萨外送妹了012---Sounds like someone wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
这个嘛  原来是这样  你喜欢凯特琳012---Well... Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
罗斯  我们分手都两年了  中间你还结过婚012---Ha, ha, Ross, we broke up two years ago. You've been married since then.

太完美了012---This is perfect.
她一定会回来送你的素食彼萨012---She'll have to come back here with your pizza.
到时候  我就展现出我罗斯的魅力012---And when she does, I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.

钱德  她完全听不懂英文012---Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
抱歉  我以为你是乔伊的另一个阿妈012---Ha, ha, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.
我还猛说英文012---I've done it again.
她是我的头号影迷012---Nonnie's my biggest fan.

你得回家拿我借你的耳环  钱德要我今晚戴那副耳环012---You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
好  应该是放在我皮包里012---Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. 
你去穿衣服  我去找  好012---Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them. Okay.

叫她戴自己的耳环  这就是她的耳环012---Tell her to wear her own earrings. These are her earrings.

真是多谢你了012---Thank you for that.
我没有打情骂俏012---I was not flirting.
没关系   我不在意  无所谓012---It's okay. I don't care. Ha, ha. It's fine.
什么  真的012---Really? Really?
小事一桩  我动不动也是这样012---It's no big deal. I do it all the time.
你动不动就跟人打情骂俏012---So, uh  Ahem. You flirt with guys all the time?
是啊  那又不代表什么  你不是也不代表什么意义吗012---Sure. It doesn't mean anything. Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you.
对啊  但是有一点很不一样  你比我辣多了012---But there's a big difference. Sorry, You are a lot hotter than I am.
这是真的012---True story.
钱德  你真的介意012---Ha, ha. Chandler, This actually bothers you?
对  我是介意  我想很多人都会介意012---Yes, it does bother me! And I think it'd bother a lot of people.
瑞秋  你和罗斯在一起那时012---When you were going out with Ross,
他跟别的女人打情骂俏  你会不会介意012---did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
不会  他跟别的女人上床  我才会介意012---Uh, no. No, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
真是多谢了012---And thank you for that.
但其实我没啥好担心的  罗斯从来就不太会打情骂俏012---But I never had anything to worry about.Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
什么  什么012---What ? What ? Ha, ha.
你在说什么  对你不就有效012---What are you talking about? It worked with you.
你说的真是对极了012---Oh! Y'know what? you're right.
我们认识  你对我打情骂俏  九年后你终于追到我了012---Oh! We met, you flirted and then, bam, nine years later, you had me.

或许现在才轮到你上012---Maybe your scene's coming up.
不太可能  看到那个装尸体的袋子没012---Not likely. Because you see that body bag right there?
有啊  里头装的是我012---Yeah. I'm in it.
太糟糕了  你要怎么办012---This is terrible, what are you going to do?
不知道012---I don't know.
我的老祖母活着  就是为了看我演戏012---This little, old lady lives for my career.
上回《我们的日子》不要我  她差点难过到死掉012---When they dumped me off Days of Our Lives, she almost died.
那样很不妙012---That's not good.
你没在笑  别用那种表情  笑啊  大家继续笑012---You're not smiling. Not that face! Smile, everybody smile! Ha, ha.
乔伊  你怎么不实话实说   那又不能怪你012---Joey，Why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
如果我们继续这样说话  会不会吓到她012---If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?

可是我已经还你了啊012---But I already gave them back to you.
不  没有啊012---No, you didn't.
好  我已经没还给你  我就是这样说的啊012---All right, I already didn't gave them back to you. That's what I said.
瑞秋  另一个耳环在哪里012---Ahem. Rachel，Where's that other earring?

好了  时间紧迫  你要我现在就跟你解释012---Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
嘿  菲比  那个素食彼萨  你吃得还习惯吗012---Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya?
你和那些蔬菜  还真是有两下子  是吧012---You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
你干嘛怪里怪气的012---Why are you being weird?
你喜不喜欢012---Do you like it?
不喜欢  否则我就会问 〝你干嘛装可爱〞了012---No. That would be, "Why are you being cute?"
好吧  我在练习打情骂俏012---Okay. I'm working on my flirting.
原来如此  我没看出来012---Oh! I did not get that.
摩妮卡  你喜欢看 《法网游龙》吗012---So, uh, Monica,do you like the Law & Order?
喜欢  很好看012---Yeah, it's good. Oh.
我今天发现到了新的你012---See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today,
好比你爱看《法网游龙》012---like you like the Law & Order 
还有你到处跟人打情骂俏012---and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
好  我来问个清楚  你可以打情骂俏  我却不行012---Okay, let me get this straight. It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?
真高兴我们把话说清楚了012---Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up.
抱歉  但你听我说  男女有些事是不一样的012---Look, I'm sorry, but some things are different for men and women.
继续   教我一些男女的差别012---Go on, teach me about men and women.
虽然我已经教过你很多了  不过012---Okay. I've already taught you so much already, but whatever.
你跟男人打情骂俏的时候012---See when you flirt with a guy
你觉得只是打情骂俏  没啥大不了的012---you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal."
但对方会觉得  他终于找到人上床了012---But the guy thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me."
不可能  这是真的012---No way! It's true.
真可悲  这也是真的012---Well, that's pathetic. Again, true.
男人都这样吗   醒着的男人都适用012---This goes for all guys? All guys that are awake.
等我们上床睡觉后012---Then we go to sleep.
世界另一边的男人起床  继续做一模一样的事012---All guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
好  又进广告了  我还是没跟她说012---All right. It's another commercial and I still haven't told her.
乔伊  这是像最后一段广告  你只剩十分钟012---Joey, This is like the last commercial. Look, You've got 10 minutes left.
我知道  你要我怎么办012---I know! What am I gonna do? Oh!
不许你落跑  留她在这里012---No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here.
对  好啦012---Yeah, all right. Oh!
乔伊012---Joey?
乔伊  马上回来012---Uh, Joey's gonna be right back.
马上回来012---Right back?
我们顺便来聊聊你吧012---Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. 
你年纪大  个子小012---So, you're old and small.
嘿  找到没012---Hey. Did you find it?
耳环是没有  但我在沙发底下  找到我的太阳眼镜012---The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch!
我从去年夏天找到现在012---I've been looking for these since last summer.
那是我借你的太阳眼镜012---Those are my sunglasses. You borrowed them from me.
好  别激动  还你就是了012---Okay. Calm down. Here they are.
菲比012---Phoebe.
我们要怎么办   我不知道012---What do we do? I don't know. I don't know!
我们只好老实跟摩妮卡说了012---We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.
老天  她一定会杀了我012---Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.
我可以跟她说是我弄掉的012---I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
那就太好了012---Oh, that'd be great.
摩妮卡  我有话要跟你说012---Mon, could I talk to you?
好  什么事012---Yeah. What is it? Um
我弄丢了你一只耳环  对不起  我真的很抱歉012---I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.
好吧  都弄丢了还能怎样012---All right, well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it, you lost it.
我保证会赔你一副新的  我真的很愧疚012---I'll replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
没关系  你又不是故意的  不是012---That's fine. You didn't do it on purpose. No.
瞧你难过的  来012---Look at you. Come here.
好点了没  有啊  你最棒了012---You feel better? Ha, ha. Yeah. You're the best.
好  等一等012---Okay, wait a minute.
等一等  我不能这样012---Wait a minute, I can't do this.
听着  其实不是菲比弄丢的012---Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.
她把你的耳环借我  是我弄丢的  我真的很抱歉012---She lent me the earrings. I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
我也觉得好愧疚012---I feel terrible too.
所以我才不借给你东西012---That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!
先是我的首饰  不是首饰  就是我的蓝色毛衣012---Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater!
不是蓝色毛衣  就是我的太阳眼镜012---And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses.
你的太阳眼镜  对012---Your sunglasses? Yes.
对啊012---Oh, right.
彼萨外送  我的012---Pizza. Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!
好  要开始了012---Okay, here goes.
准备见识见识一流的打情骂俏012---Prepare yourselves for some class-A flirting.
等等012---Okay, hold on.
我准备好了012---Okay.
你犯不着这样012---Honey, you have nothing to prove.
如果你真的喜欢这个女孩  我也不觉得打情骂俏是好方法012---If you really like this girl, I don't think flirting is the right way
等着看就知道  好吧012---You'll see.Okay.
她叫什么名字012---Oh, what's her name?
凯特琳012---Caitlin!

所以012---So
你们做彼萨  是用烧木头的炉子吗012---Do you make the pizzas in one of those, uh, wood-burning ovens?
不是  其实是瓦斯炉012---No, actually, I think they're gas.
瓦斯炉012---Gas? Wow, ha, ha.
真带劲012---Intense.
如果连盖勒家的人都这样打情骂俏的话012---If this is the way all the Gellers flirt,
我们就没有问题了012---we don't have a problem.
嘿  你知道瓦斯的味道吗012---Hey, uh You know that smell gas has?
知道012---Yeah.
那是加进去的  什么012---They put that in. What?
瓦斯其实是无色无味012---The gas is odorless.
加上味道  是为了让人在瓦斯漏气时能闻得出来012---But they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
好吧012---Well, okay.
很多气体都有味道012---A lot of other gas smells.
救命喔012---Oh, the humanity.
甲烷有味道012---Methane smells
不好意思  我真的得走了012---You know what? Um, actually, I really should go.
我还没付钱呢012---Oh, but I haven't paid you yet.
没关系  你们点了那么多  这一个算我请客012---Y'know what? That's okay. You guys have ordered so many that this one's on me.
我是不是跟她说到瓦斯的事012---Was I talking to her about gas?
那根本就是主题012---More so than anything else.
我觉得很有意思012---I-I-I found it interesting.
我很遗憾 不用012---I'm sorry. Look, no-no, Hey, hey. 
别担心012---Don't worry about it.
九年之后  她和我就能在一起了012---In nine years, she and I will be right there! Ha, ha.
好  我去清掉这些彼萨盒012---Okay. Well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
罗斯  怎么了012---Ross? Yeah?

其实  是我朋友罗斯012---But, actually, um, my friend Ross
他只要打情骂俏就会紧张012---he just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
天啊  他是在打情骂俏   没错012---Oh, my God! That was flirting?  Yeah.
我知道你的感觉012---I know, I know.
不过一旦过了那个阶段012---but uh just, I'm telling you,  once, once you get past that part,
那个让你想要去死的阶段012---where it just feels like you wanna die
你会发现  其实他是个大好人012---he's-he's really a good person.
开口闭口都是瓦斯的那个人012---The guy with the gas? Yeah.
给你说  他真的很体贴也风趣012---I'm-I'm telling you， he's really sweet and really funny
还有一副好心肠012---and he's just, oh, got a good heart.
而且我觉得  他很喜欢你  真的吗012---And besides, I think he really likes you. Really?
我们七个人  却叫了十个披萨  这还不够明显吗012---Well,y'know, we have seven people and 10 pizzas. What do you think?
我想说乔伊很会吃012---I just, I thought Joey was there.
你可以留到星期一  然后我会强制驱离012---You've got till Monday. Then I move to dismiss.
嘿  罗斯012---Hey, Ross?

虽然我搞不懂  但她要我转交她的电话给你012---I don't get it but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
她自己给你的   是啊012---And she just gave you this? Yeah!
瑞秋  谢了  但我不需要你帮忙012---Rach, thanks. But I don't need you doing me any favors.
我没帮忙啊  是她觉得你很可爱012--- I-I-I didn't! I didn't. She thought you were cute.
这点我倒是相信012---Well, that I can believe.

万一罗斯听到了  回电给她  他们又会合了怎么办012---what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together?
你希望那样吗012---Is that what you want?
看到罗斯跟那个控制欲超强  神经兮兮的疯子艾蜜莉复合012---Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily?
那个不让罗斯见你的艾蜜莉012---The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
不行  万万不可012---No. Oh, no, no.God, no.
绝对不能和她复合012---He should not get back with her.
你知  我知  就连罗斯都知道012---I know that, you know that. Even Ross knows that.
但我们还是没有权力  擅自洗掉给罗斯的留言012---But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
我可是他的妹妹012---I'm his sister. okay? 
我爱他  不想看他受到伤害012---and I love him. I don't want to see him get hurt.
得了  我这样还没有权控制012---Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him...
帮助他吗012---Help him?
我觉得需要帮忙的不是他012---I don't think he's the one who needs help.
艾蜜莉非常不稳定012---No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay?
她竟然想在结婚当天落跑012---I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.
好啦  但你看看  她让罗斯陷入了什么处境012---Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in!
你要罗斯怎么办012---What's he gonna do?
难道让罗斯在艾蜜莉结婚当天  跑去破坏婚礼012---Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?!
谁做得出那种事012---I mean, who would do that?!
好啦  不过这是两码子事012---Okay, fine. All right. but that's y'know, it's different! 
虽然有很多人都是重复的012---Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
艾蜜莉显然想用变态的笑话  来恶整罗斯012---Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
够了  你疯了012---Okay, you are crazy!
她听起来真的很沮丧012---I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!
你听听就知道012---I mean, listen!
您的留官已经删除012---Your messages have been erased.
不会吧012---Noooooooo!
好  我们很安全  对吧  不可能会有厄运降临012---Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
对  不过我倒想起来了  签一下这个012---No. But that reminds me. Sign this.
这是什么012---What is it?
没什么  只是断腿或脑袋开花  也不能告到市政府头上012---Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
快点喔  我要签012---Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
好  他来了012---Okay, Here he comes.
他在干嘛  搞什么鬼啊012---What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?
什么   怎么了012---What? What? What? What is it?
没事吧  发生什么事012---Is everything okay? What's going on?
他看到我们了  别动  不要看他012---Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
没事的  只是车子熄火了012---Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.
看看  你想用身体掩护朋友012---Hey, look at that. You tried to save your buddy.
看到没有  他冒死拯救朋友012---You see that? You see what he did?
你没事吧012---You okay, man?
乔伊  谢了012---Uh-huh. Thanks, Joey.
那我呢012---Uh... Hello?
嗨012---Hi.
我们应该走了012---All right, I guess we should go.
不  等等012---No, wait. wait.
喔  对了012---Oh, yeah. Right.
不是啦  摩妮卡012---No. Monica.
摩妮卡  我们得补救这个012---Monica, we have to fix this.
我们无能为力啊  你已经把留言删掉了012---There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
我可以老实跟他说啊012---Yeah well unless we tell him.
如果你想要这么明理的话  我也争不过你012---Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you!
好啦  你要说就说  我不想介入012---All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
或许又是艾蜜莉打来的  她想说一样的话012---Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
嘿  罗斯  是你啊  我只是要你记得这种感觉012---Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling.
活着是一种幸运012---You are lucky to be alive.
所以每一天都要活得精彩012---So live every day to the fullest.
珍爱自己  好吗012---Love yourself, okay?
好吧  也别忘了买邮票  再见012---Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
哇  只要把这留言放给艾蜜莉听  所有的问题就都解决了012---Wow! Play that message for Emily, and this problem goes away.
可不是吗012---Right?
谁要来见见英雄012---Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
约翰葛林来了012---John Glenn is here?
不  是乔伊012---No. Joey.
菲比  今晚真是太不可思议了012---Pheebs, We had the most incredible night. Okay,
我们在警车里   慢着012---so, we're in the car... Wait. Hold on.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
好  继续说012---Okay, go ahead.
好  我们在警车里  012---Okay, okay, So we're in the car, Right?
突然"砰"一声  有人开枪012---And bang! A shot was fired.
乔伊完全不顾自己的安危  扑到我身上保护我012---And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
天啊  乔伊012---My God, Joey!
那是汽车熄火放屁的声音012---It was a car backfire.
对  但是当时他并不知道  对  我不知道012---Yeah, But he didn't know that.Yeah, I didn't know that.
那很有可能是子弹012---And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
乔伊  有没有想过要当警察   警界很需要你这种人012---Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
听到巨响就吓得跳起来012---Who jumps at loud noises.
我今晚有可能丧命的012---Wow. I could have died tonight.
对  如果那部放屁的车  把你碾过去的话012---Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you.
我先回家去了  省得罗斯大谈人生新发现012---I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
我的人生的确有了新发现012---I do have a newfound respect for life.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你要吃晚餐吗012---So you wanna get some dinner?
好啊  当然012---Yeah, sure.
你知道吗  若现在听到枪声  我一定会扑倒你身上012---Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
是吗  那我们或许应该  去穷山恶极的社区散步012---Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
好啊012---Okay.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
罗斯  你别再闹了012---Cut it out Ross!
我不想在同一天里  先是救你然后又痛扁你一顿012---I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
兄弟012---Dude.
你刚才怎么先闪了012---How come you took off?
我只是去散步  在客厅里绕来绕去012---Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever¡­
有什么不对吗012---Is something wrong?
没有  我只是累了  走路走累了012---No. No, I'm just tired.Y'know, from-from the walk.
好吧  你扑上去救罗斯012---Okay. You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
罗斯012---Ross.
原来是这么一回事012---That's what this is about.
天啊  你恨罗斯012---Oh, my God. You hate Ross.
我没有恨罗斯  你当然有012---I don't hate Ross. Of course you do.
我救了他  你生我的气  这样全都说得通了012---I saved him. You're mad at me. It all adds up.
你想铲除罗斯  铲除什么012---You want Ross out of the picture. What picture?
不知道  但是你说的话很吓人012---I don't know. But I don't like what I'm hearing.
我很高兴你在汽车放屁事件中  救了罗斯一命012---Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire,
但那如果真的是子弹怎么办  你竟然救他不救我012---but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
原来你是在气这个  你以为我觉得罗斯比你重要012---Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you.
不是这样的   我知道你能照顾自己012---No, I knew you could take care of yourself.
罗斯需要别人帮忙  他不像你我见过大场面012---You know? I mean, Ross needs help. He's not "street" like us.
话说到头  你宁愿先去救罗斯  也不来救我012---When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me.
这才是重点012---That's the bottom line.
不完全是这样012---Well, no, not exactly! 
其实我那不是要救罗斯012---All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.
好吗012---Okay?
我的三明治在罗斯旁边012---My sandwich was next to Ross.
真的012---All right?
我是要救我的三明治012---I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
怕它被枪打到012---From a bullet?
我知道这么说  像是没啥道理012---I know it doesn't make much sense.
岂止没啥道理012---"Much" sense?
钱德  那是本能反应  我就扑过去了012---Look Chandler, it was instinct. Okay? I just went for it!
所以你冒死  去救三明治012---So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
我知道这听起来很夸张012---I know it sounds crazy...
但是  钱德  这可是世界上最棒的三明治012---...but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world.
所以你并不觉得罗斯比我重要012---So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
才不  我绝对不会那样012---No. I would never do that.
你就像是我的亲兄弟012---You're like my brother.
真的  对  为了证明你对我的意义012---Really?  Yeah. In fact, to prove how much you mean to me...
给你012---Here.
谢了  轻点啊  这不是热狗012---Thanks. No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
是不是很好吃012---How good is that?
看吧012---See?
慢着  你在干嘛012---Oh-whoa-hey, dude, What are you doing?
你不是要证明我对你的意义012---I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
是啊  用一口来证明012---Yeah. With a bite!
你也帮帮忙012---Gee-e-e-eez!
嗨012---Hi.
瑞秋  你在这里干嘛012---Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
别动不动就往我们公寓跑  我这只是小巫见大巫而已012---Hey, you know what? You are in our apartment all the time.Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
没关系啦  重点是你来了012---It doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
你是我朋友  而你来到了这里012---You're my friend and you're here.
好  我有一点点害怕  罗斯  你是怎么了012---Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
今晚发生了最不寻常的事012---The most amazing thing happened tonight.
我还以为自己要去见阎王了012---I thought my number was up.
我真正面临到了濒死的经历012---I had an actual near-death experience.
什么  什么  怎么回事012---What?! What? What happened?!
好  我们不是跟盖瑞坐警车兜风吗012---Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? 
有人朝着我开枪012---and somebody took a shot at me.
真的吗012---Really?
不是  是车子放屁012---No. A car backfired.
但是  我当时以为是有人对我开枪012---But I thought somebody was taking a shot at me.
瑞秋  我劫后余生012---And, Rach...I survived.
我的人生拥有了全新视野012---And I was filled with this great respect for life.
我要真切体验每一刻012---Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment.
我要把握每一个机会012---I want to seize every opportunity.
现在的一切都变得好清晰012---I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
全都是因为汽车放屁012---Because a car backfired?
好吧  你来这里干嘛012---Okay. Why are you here?
我不知道这件事符不符合  你所谓的〝把握每一个机会〞012---Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing...
不过艾蜜莉今天打电话给你012---...but Emily called you today.
你跟她说了话  没有  她在你电话里留言012---You talked to her? No, She left a message.
不过留言被删掉了012---But it kind of got erased.
我是说  你的答录机有问题012---I mean,  There's just ... something wrong with your machine.
那她说了什么012---Well, okay, what-what did she say?
说什么对结婚的事有点反悔012---Well,something about having second thoughts about the wedding.
说你们分手是个错误012---And did you guys make a mistake breaking up?
她要你回电012---And she wants you to call her.
现在  我跟你说这件事很对吧012---Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
是啊  当然是这样012---Yeah. Yes. Of course.
好  谢谢你012---Okay, thank you. Thank you.
我要去跟摩妮卡说  我这样做是对的012---Because...I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.
因为你知道吗  她不希望  那不重要012---Because y'know what?  she didn't want...Not important.
重点是  我是对的  你自己决定012---Point is, I was right. Your decision.
好  我是对的  你自己决定要不要回电012---Okay? I was right. Your decision.
对012---Right.
我猜我应该回电给艾蜜莉012---I guess I should call Emily.
不对  你的决定不对012---No, that's not the right decision.
罗斯  你清醒一点012---That's not right. Ross, come on.
那个女人把你给整惨了012---I mean, that woman made you miserable!
罗斯  你真的想要再来一次012---Okay, Ross? Do you really want to get back into that?
如果她是在昨天打来的  我压根不会想回电012---Okay, look. Yesterday...I wouldn't have even considered calling her back.
但在我面对濒死经历的同一天  我的前妻正好打电话来012---But my ex-wife calls on the same day...I have a near-death experience?
这一定有所含意吧012---I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
罗斯  那不是濒死经历  就连经验都谈不上012---That was not a near-death experience. That was barely an experience.
当时你并不在场012---You weren't there.
或许这就是我应该把握的事012--- Okay, Maybe this is something that I'm supposed to seize, you know?
好吧  你知道吗012---Okay. You know what?
或许这无关把握或是不把握012---Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
或许这是关于逃避012---Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
就拿今天来说  你逃过了012---Okay? Look at today.I mean, you escaped...
死亡012---...death.
或许这是你逃避的机会  不去和艾蜜莉复合012---y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily.
这还蛮有道理的012---That does make sense.
因为我要把握住这个机会012---Because I do want to seize some opportunity...
但是我真的不想她见面或联络012---...but I really don't want to see or talk to her.
这不就结了012---Well, there you go.
或许今天只是〝千钧一发〞日012---Yeah, maybe today's just close-call day.
嘿  瑞秋  谢了012---Hey, thanks, Rach.
亲爱的  甭客气012---Oh, honey. No problem.
等等   留言灯在闪呢012---Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking.
或许留言没被删掉012---Maybe you didn't erase it.
罗斯  是你啊012---Hey, Ross, it's you...
这是旧的留言012---Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message,
没什么好听的  没错012---Nobody needs to hear that. No.
摩妮卡有来过吗  有啊012---Hey, um, was Monica here? Yeah.
要她把我的钱还来012---I want my money back.
是要用来买邮票的吧012---Yeah, uh You probably need that for stamps, right?
菲比  盖瑞有真的中枪过吗012---Hey, Pheebs? Has Gary ever been shot at for real?
有  一次012---Yes, once.
小小的一次012---Yeah, a little. 
算是他自己打的  这故事没什么好讲的012---He kind of did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
不知道我置身战火会怎样012---I wonder how I'd react under fire.y'know?
不是汽车放屁  是枪林弹雨012---And not backfire...but-but heavy fire, 
好比我在战场上之类的012---like I was in a war or something.
我去打仗一定很厉害012---Man, I would be great in a war.
一定会是很棒的军事领袖012---I mean, I really, I think I'd make a fantastic military leader.
跟你们这些人比起来  我一定会最先当上将军012---I mean, I know I'd make general before any of you guys.
在你被自己的部下枪杀前还是之后啊012---Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
我知道乔伊会在哪里012---I know where Joey would be.
他一定会在散兵坑里保护大家012---He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
对  如果那个散兵坑  是用三明治围起来的话012---Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
没错  英雄三明治012---Yeah, hero sandwiches.
你们知道我主张和平  我对什么战争都没兴趣012---Well you all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm not interested in war in any way.
不过等到革命的那一天来临  我一定要把你们消灭光光012---But y'know what? when the revolution comes, I'll have to destroy you all.
乔伊  你例外012---Not you, Joey.
我要点咖啡外带  洋娃娃  你也要吗012---Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
不用了  谢谢012---I'm fine. Thanks.
我不能叫你洋娃娃吧012---Yeah, see, I can't pull of "baby doll," can I?
对  从那次甜甜嘴事件  我们已经学到教训了012---No, I think we learned that from the "sugar lips" incident.
我去点茶来喝012---I'm gonna get some tea. Okay.
小亲亲  你好吗012---How you doing, pumpkin?
行不通012---Nope.
你们俩看起来越来越好了呢012---So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
我知道  真的很好  其实我正想要菲比搬来我家012---I know. Really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
天啊  你觉得呢012---Oh, my God. What do you think?
我觉得这真是太棒了  你什么时候要问她012---I think that it's so great. When are you gonna ask her?
今晚  你先别透露啊012---Tonight. But don't say anything, okay?
我发誓不说  人格担保012---I swear. I promise. I promise.
天啊  我超兴奋的012---My God, I'm so excited.
我跟你说  记得不要送她花012---All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay?
因为花谢了  她会哭  还会帮花办葬礼之类的012---Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
亲爱的  下班后再见  好  再见012---I'll see you after work, sweetie. Okay. Bye.
我们应该去看什么电影012---So, what movie should we see?
盖瑞要请你搬过去跟他住012---Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him.
什么  真的吗  他刚才在吧台上跟我说的012---What? Really? He just told me at the counter.
他要我保证不会说出去  但我实在是憋不住了012---He made me promise not to tell but I couldn't hold it in any longer.
我不敢相信  对  因为太快了  太快012---I can't believe this. Right? Because it's fast. Because it's so fast. It's fast.
别激动  是菲比  又不是你012---Relax. It's Phoebe, not you. Oh.
菲比  很厉害  有一套012---Good for you, Pheebs. Way to go.
不过真的是很快  对吧  才不是呢012---No, but it is fast, isn't it? No.
我是很喜欢他  没错  但我还没有准备好要同居012---I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready.
那你打算怎么办  不知道  兵来将挡012---So, what are you gonna do? I don't know. I'll just handle it.
干脆找你去疏通他012---I'll ask you to talk to him.
我   为何是我012---Me? Why me?
因为给予承诺  你最怕了012---Because you are so afraid of commitment.
你去跟他说说  让他也跟你一样怕012---You talk to him. Make him scared like you,
让他成为一个  男人012---make him a man.
我会去试试   但我不确定会多有用012---I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do...
因为比起以前  我现在已经很不害怕承诺了012---...because I'm less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
真是太甜蜜了012---That is so sweet.
还是很怕  但我会处理  没问题012---Still terrified. I'll take care of it no problem.
老友记  第五季  第21集  掷球游戏012---Friends  S05E21  The One With The Ball
罗斯   斯塔顿岛真的是岛吗012---Hey, Ross, is, uh, Staten Island really an island?
是啊  所以才叫斯塔顿〝岛〞012---Uh-huh. That's why they call it Staten "Island."
我还以为那跟长岛一样012---Oh, I thought it was like Long Island.
长岛也是岛012---Also an island.
几点了  2点17分012---Hey, what time is it? Two seventeen.
你知道吗  我们丢这个球012---Wow, you realize we've been throwing this ball
连续一小时都没有漏接落地012---without dropping it for an hour?
你说真的012---Are you serious?
对  我半小时前就发现了  我怕坏了好事才没说012---Yeah, I realized it a half-hour ago, but I didn't wanna say anything because I didn't wanna jinx it.
哇  我们还真会丢接球呢012---Wow, we are pretty good at this.
我们完全忘了吃午饭012---Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.
这是我第一次忘记吃饭012---I think that's the first time I've ever missed a meal.
对  我的裤子都有点松了012---Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
嗨  两位  摩妮卡在吗012---Hey, you guys. Uh, is Monica here?
不在  不在012---No. No.
听着  我带了东西回来  我不确定她会喜欢012---All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it,
听起有点奇怪012---And it's gonna seem crazy...
那个东西我从小就想要了012---...but this is something I've wanted since I was a little girl.
你带史恩卡希迪来012---You bought Shaun Cassidy.
不是  我也希望是012---No. I wish.
你们准备好了没   好了012---Okay, you ready? Yeah.
那好012---OK
请看012---Check it out.
那是啥啊  什么鬼东西012---Oh, my God. What is it? What the hell is that?
这是猫啊012---It's a cat.
这才不是猫012---That is not a cat.
这就是猫啊012---Yes, it is.
他的皮怎么翻出来了012---Why is it inside out?
帮帮忙012---Excuse me,
这可是展示级的  纯种狮身人面猫012---but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat.
你花了多少钱买的012---How much did you pay for that?
有点奢侈  但我谈到了很好的价钱012---Well, it was a little extravagant, but I got a pretty good deal.
是吗  多少钱012---Yeah, how much?
一千美元012---A thousand bucks.
买一只猫012---On a cat?
那才不是猫012---It's not a cat.
你们这两个玩球的  给我听好了012---All right. Listen, ball boys.
我小时候祖母就养了这种猫  他们最讨人喜欢了012---My grandmother had one of these when I was little. and it was the sweetest thing.
超可爱的  躺在我的膝盖上  整天满足地喵喵叫012---I mean, it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and just purr all day long...
我还会拿鞋带在地上拖  让他追着跑012---...and I would drag a shoe string on the ground and it would chase it.
不要钱的猫也会那样啊012---Free cats do that too, you know.
那才不是猫012---It's not a cat.
反正我买得很兴奋  我才不管你们怎么想012---Look, guys, I'm really excited about this, okay? I don't care what you think.
我要去帮威丝克森太太   张罗出一个小猫砂盒012---I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.
不然我要叫他〝毛毛〞吗012---Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?
你要去吃点东西吗012---Hey, do you wanna get something to eat
还是要看我们能来回丢多久012---or, uh..do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
继续丢球  是啊012---Uh, the ball thing. Yeah?
罗斯  若我们连丢两小时不落地  那样是不是很棒012---Hey, Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go for like two straight hours without dropping it?
当然啦012---Uh, yeah, it would.
来吧  好012---Let's do it. Okay.
怎么了012---Uh-oh. What?
我要尿尿  但瑞秋在厕所里012---I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom.
没想到这样也行012---Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it.
是啊012---I know.
你别换手喔012---Don't switch hands, okay?
小姐们  你们在这里干嘛012---Hey, ladies. What are you in here for?
钱德  你来这里干嘛012---Hey, Chandler, what are you doing here?
盖瑞  我是来报案的  是吗012---Gary, I am here to report a crime. Yeah?
我们俩不常聚在一起  是一种罪012---It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
你有什么事012---Ha, ha. What's up?
听说你在考虑要菲比跟你同居012---Uh, well, I heard that you were thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you...
我心想我们或许应该聊聊  男人跟我的对话012---...and I thought maybe we should have a talk, you know, man to... well, me.
好啊  没问题012---Sure, okay.
你在发什么神经012---Um, are you crazy?
你疯了  若你和菲比同居  你们两个就会住在一起了012---Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be, you know, living together.
对  我考虑过了  我知道这会让我快乐012---Yeah, I considered that. I just know it'd make me happy.
你是说害怕吧  不  我是说快乐012---Heh. You mean scared. No, I mean happy.
害怕  快乐012---Scared happy.
钱德  你在干嘛012---Chandler, what are you doing?
我在让你张开眼睛啊  你看不出来吗012---I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see,
若你和菲比同居  她就永远都会在012---if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there.
你回家会看到她  你上床也会看到她012---You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there.
你起床呢  对  她还是在012---You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.
我知道  我都等不及了012---I know. I can't wait.
你父母的婚姻很幸福  对吧012---Were your parents happy or something?
钱德  我看这件事的角度是  我很幸运能找到我的真爱012---Listen, Chandler, the way I see it. I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love.
我想要尽量多跟她在一起012---I just wanna be around her as much as I can.
怪了  这件事从你嘴里说出来  感觉就没那么恐怖了012---Wow, you know, when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
所以你懂我的意思吧   对  我想我懂012---So you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I think I do.
这样吧  跟她同居012---You know what? You move in with her.
马上  就去跟她同居012---You move in right with her right now.
或许我也应该和摩妮卡同居012---Maybe I should move in with Monica.
不成  你们不能操之过急012---No, it's too soon for you guys.
是啊  你说的对012---Yeah, you're right about that.
他们找到中生代乳齿象化石012---…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic mastodon...
却在嘴部发现到  类似古生代两栖类的构造012---...they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.
怎么会牛头不对马嘴012---How did it get there?
或许这个游戏应该安静一点012---Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
嗨  嗨012---Hey, guys. Hey.
乔伊  我昨晚把手表放在柜子上012---Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.
本来还在这里  到哪儿去了012--- It was right here, Where is it?
我不知道  别闹了  我上班快迟到了012---I don't know. Well, come on, I'm late for work.
你怎么知道  你又没戴表012---How do you know? You don't have a watch.
你们能不能停一下再丢球  先帮我找表012---Guys, could you stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it?
不知道  没办法喔012---Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it.
怎样啦012---What?
怎样都好  千万别把球掉地上012---Whatever you do, do not drop that ball
我们保持球不落地已经012---Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
2小时27分钟012---Two hours, 27 minutes.
真的啊012---Really?
我今天没办法去上班  我人不太舒服012---I'm not gonna be able to make it in to work today. Um, I don't feel very good.
漂亮012---Yes!
我刚才突然觉得自己好多了  但其实没有012---Wow, uh, for a second there, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.
瑞秋  嗨012---Hey, Rach. Hey.
快来看  球不落地接近三小时012---Check it out. Almost three hours without dropping it.
恭喜了  真是浪费时间012---Wow, congratulations. That's quite a waste of time.
瑞秋  怎么了012---Rach. Yeah.
你身上都是抓痕  怎么了012---You have scratches all over you. What happened?
是我的猫  什么012---Well, it's my cat. What?
对了  我养了只猫  我不想养猫了012---Oh, yeah, I got a cat. I don't want a cat.
别担心  那不是猫  没错012---Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. Yeah.
这只猫跟我祖母养过的猫  完全不一样012---You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.
既不讨人喜欢  也不可爱012---It's not sweet. It's not cute.
我在地上拉着线逗他玩012---I even dragged a string on the ground...
他竟然发飙  把我抓得乱七八糟012---...and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.
我知道这听来很疯狂  但我发誓012---And I swear... I know this sounds crazy,
这只猫每次嘘我的时候  我知道他都在说〝瑞秋〞012---but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel."
花一千美元买一只猫  比刚才那些话更疯狂012---Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.
你欠我三百美元不还  还拿一千美元去买猫012---You paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me 300?
我本来打算让你跟他玩的012---Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
嗨012---Hey.
你跟盖瑞聊过同居的事没012---Hmm, Did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
聊过了  我觉得你应该答应012---Yes, I did, and I think you should do it.
什么012---What?
他很棒  他也很爱你  你非常幸运012---He's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot. You are a very lucky lady.
你真没用012---You are useless.
害怕承诺是你唯一会做的事012---Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do...
你竟然连那件事都做不好  天啊012---The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
抱歉012---Sorry.
换做我都愿意和他同居012---If he asked me, I'd move in with him.
窝囊废  你滚吧012---get out of here, good-for-nothing.
嘿  钱德  嘿  盖瑞012---Hey, Chandler. Hey, Gar.
亲爱的012---Hey, sweetie.
能不能先聊下  好啊012---Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. .
好012---Okay
你今天很美012---You look very pretty today.
谢谢  好吧012---Thanks. Okay.
是这样的  好012---Here's the thing. Yeah.
我很想让这段关系更进一步012---You know, I really want this relationship to move forward.
因为不进则退012---Because if you're not moving forward, you know, you're just moving backwards.
不是那样的  真的  如果不进  就是静止不动012---Now, that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're staying still.
静止不动是很好的  你看012---And staying still is good. Watch this.
菲比  是012---Phoebe? Yeah?
我要你搬来一起住012---I want you to move in with me.
那真是太甜蜜了012---That is so sweet.
但你不觉得稍微太快了点吗012---But don't you think that it's a little it's too soon?
我们彼此  还有很多地方并不太了解012---I mean, there's so much we don't know about each other.
好吧  我懂了012---Oh, okay. I get it.
我只是  不希望我们操之过急  你懂吧012---I just—I don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for, you know.
我不想搞砸我们现在的一切012---I really don't want to mess up what we have.
我担心同居会铸成大错012---I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
是啊012---Yeah.
所以我的答案是  我答应012---Which is why my answer is yes.
真的吗012---Really? Uh-huh.
你好高兴012---Uh-huh! You're so happy.
摩妮卡  别用那么大力气012---Monica, stop throwing it so hard.
我们是同一队012---We're on the same team.
四个小时  你们就这样丢了四小时012---Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
宝贝  没错012---That's right, baby.
好  让我加入  不  不行012---All right. Let me in. No, no. Don't do it.
什么012---What?
他是漏球大王012---He's a dropper.
对  没错012---Oh, yeah. That's right.
我才不是漏球大王012---I'm not a dropper.
这其实是三个人的游戏012---It's really a three-person game, you know?
还不就是你丢我接012---It's throwing and catching.
好吧012---All right.
喔  好难啊012---Oh, oh, it's so hard.
别紧张  那不是猫啊012---Don't worry, guys. It's not a cat.
我的  天啊012---Oh, my... Oh, good God.
我放弃了  我不知道要怎么处理这玩意儿012---I give up, you guys. I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing.
送他进烤箱也没用012---Baking it didn't help, huh?
送回你买的地方呢012---Why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
我试过了  他们不收012---I tried. They won't take her back.
或许是因为他是反基督的爪牙012---Maybe that's because she's a minion of the Antichrist.
瑞秋  店家为什么不收012---Rach, why won't they take it back?
他们说要收回可以  但只退我店里的购物券012---Well, they said they would, but would only give me store credit.
我用它来买什么呢   一千只普通的猫不成012---What am I gonna do, get a thousand regular cats?
不然你先留着  等到你找到处理的方法012---If you want, you can keep it until you find out what to do with it.
不行  那不是重点012---No, Mon, that's not the point.
我花费一千美元  却搞得全身都是抓痕012---I'm out a thousand dollars.I'm all scratched up
还跟长得像手的蠢猫困在一起012---and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand.
天啊  那只猫害我流眼泪了012---Oh, my God. The cat's made my eyes water.
别给我丢球012---Don't throw it to me.
我的视力受损了012---My vision's been compromised.
天啊  好了012---Oh, God. Okay. Okay.
现在好了  真是惊险012---It's okay. Man, that was close.
是啊  你的反应也太大了点012---Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
我们有个好消息  我们要同居了  是不是很棒012---We have great news. We're moving in together. Isn't it great?
恭喜  是啊  我好兴奋012---Congratulations. That's great.I know, I'm so excited.
我也是012---So am I.
你才没有我兴奋  不可能  我是最兴奋的012---Well, you're not more excited than I am. No way. I'm the most excited. Ha.
好  晚点在局里见012---Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
好  晚点见  别忘了同居的事012---Okay, yeah, I'll see you later. Don't forget about the moving-in.
你要搬去跟他住  怎么了012---So you're moving in with him? What happened?
我不忍心拒绝他  看他伤心成那样012---I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
或许不会有事的012---But maybe it'll be all right.
我真的很喜欢他  同居八成也是迟早的事012---I do really like him a lot. and probably do it eventually anyway.
想想也可以省下不少邮票钱012---And plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
怎么着  你常写信给他012---Why, do you write him a lot?
不是  只是我听说同居的人  会分担邮票的费用  不是吗012---No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
是啊  没错012---Yeah, yeah. That's right.
抱歉  耐热手套吓了我一跳012---Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
嘿  亲爱的012---Hey, honey.
你找到公寓没有  布鲁克林高地有吗012---Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
没有  没找到012---No, nothing.
真的  是啊012---Oh, really? Yeah.
问都没有  没有012---Nothing at all? No.
只要有公寓招租  我们马上搬进去012---As soon as something opens up, we'll move right in.
不过要有附泳池的  我需要泳池012---Unless it doesn't have a pool. I need a pool.
菲比  可以跟你聊一下吗012---Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Uh-huh.
请坐  好012---Take a seat. Okay.
你没事吧  还好吧012---You okay? You feel all right?
我很好啊  因为我们要同居了012---Yeah, I feel great because we're moving in together.
报上布鲁克林高地的租屋广告  你都看过了012---So you, uh.You checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
《邮报》你有查过吗012---You-you checked the Post?
有查啊  啥都没有012---Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.
我能喝点水吗   等下012---Can I get some water? In a minute.
你查过今天的《邮报》吗012---You checked today's Post?
对  我是看今天的012---Um, yeah, today's.
这是今天的《邮报》012---Hmm. Because, uh, this is today's Post.
我找到了这些租屋广告012---And, uh, these are the listings I found.
布鲁克林高地  两房012---Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
布鲁克林高地  一房012---Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.
布鲁克林高地区  布鲁克林高地区  布鲁克林高地区012---Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights.
这些是要租的吗012---Oh, are these for rent?
我以为他们是在炫耀自己的房子有多棒012---I thought people were just bragging.
我来告诉你  我的想法012---Let me tell you what I think might be going on here.
不要看桌子  看着我012---No, no, don't look at the table. Look at me.
好吧  一个男生要求一个女生同居012---Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with him.
女生本来说好  现在反悔了012---And I think someone said yes, but now she's having doubts...
因为女生觉得这样太快了012---...because things are moving too fast for someone.
你觉得是不是这样012---Does that sound at all possible to you?
对  好  我就是那个女生012---Yes, yes. Yes, fine, I am someone.
你要我说老实话  对  我是不确定012---You want me to say it? I have doubts.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
菲比  什么事012---Phoebe. Yeah?
菲比  你有这种感觉也没关系012---Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way.
这真的是很快  我们彼此有许多地方不了解012---I mean, it is soon, and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
我只是觉得  我知道的你  我都很喜欢012---I just figured everything I know about you, I really like.
我还不知道的你  就等同居后再慢慢了解012---The things I don't know, I get to learn in a place with both our names on the mailbox.
那样好甜蜜啊012---That's so sweet.
亲爱的012---Sweetheart,
如果你觉得这样太快了  就不行的话012---but none of that matters if it's too soon for you.
我们也不用赶着现在就同居  我只要你快乐012---It's fine. We don't have to move in together. I just want you to be happy.
跟你同居会让我快乐的012---Living with you would make me happy.
菲比  你不用那样说012---Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
不  我很想跟你住在一起  我要跟你同居012---No, I really wanna live with you. I wanna move in with you.
你确定012---Are you sure?
对  百分之百确定012---Yes. Definitely, yes.
我们一起住在公寓同居吧012---Let's live in an apartment that we both live in.
太好了012---Oh, that's great.
等等012---Oh, wait, one sec. One sec.
镜子后面的人012---Hey, you. Behind the glass.
你看个什么劲啊012---Who are you looking at?
我每次进来这种房间  都想说这句话012---I've always wanted to say that every time I was in one of these rooms...
虽然我从没进来过012---...which was never.
展示猫   高级的展示猫012---Show cat. Quality show cat.
展示猫012---Show cat. Oh, my God.
天啊  你的宝宝怎么了012---What's wrong with your baby?
这不是宝宝  这是猫012---That's not a baby. That's a cat.
长得还真吓人012---Ew, it's creepy looking. .
不  他其实很讨人喜欢的  不信你看012---Oh, no. no, it's actually very sweet. It's very sweet. Look.
你要不要012---Yeah. Do you want it?
不了  我恨死猫了012---Ha, ha. No, I hate cats.
那你干嘛跟我扯半天  滚吧  继续走你的路012---Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here, all right? Move on.
帮帮忙012---Jeez
这只猫真不寻常012---Wow, what an unusual cat.
是的  谢谢你  真的是这样  你要吗012---Yes, thank you. Exactly. You want it?
有可能  我考虑要养猫  我正好要去流浪动物之家012---Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat. I was just gonna go to the shelter, but...
好吧  就他了012---Okay. Why not?
太好了  总共是两千美元012---Oh, terrific. That'll be $2,000.
什么   好吧  一千012---Ha. What? Okay, a thousand.
我以为你是要我认养你的猫012---I thought you wanted me to adopt your cat?
是啊  不过这不只是猫  更是像是一项投资012---Well, I do, but you're gonna have to look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
好吧  我要的只是猫012---Okay, yeah. I just wanted a cat.
好吧012---Okay, okay, okay.
你显然是杀价高手012---Obviously, you know how to haggle...
所以我就不唬弄你了012---...so I'm not gonna try and take you on, okay?
算你八百  我也不报警了  因为你这根本是抢劫012---So $800, and I don't call the copswhich I should because you are robbing me blind.
把钱留下  猫带走  溜之大吉吧012---Blind. Just take the cat, leave the money and run away. Just run away.
可恶012---Damn it. Ugh.
死猫  你起码也笑一下嘛012---Can't you at least smile or something?
有没有人听到  谁听到了012---Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
我饿死了012---I'm starving.
你们振作一点  就快达成连续十小时了012---Come on, guys. Suck it up. We're closing in on 10 hours.
这是比毅力的时刻012---It's gut-check time.
怎么变成是你当老大  这游戏是我们发明的012---I don't know who made you the boss. We invented this game.
帮帮忙  这游戏是因为我  才有现在的局面012---Please. I made this game what it is.
不再好玩的局面012---Not fun anymore?
我还是很饿012---I'm still hungry.
好吧  我家还有一点比萨  你们可以用一手吃吧012---All right, there's some pizza at my place. We can eat with one hand, right?
要不要  我要012---Are you with me? I am.
好  我们走012---All right, let's go. Come on.
摩妮卡大队  走啦012---Let's go, Team Monica.
好啦  队名等一下再讨论012---All right, we can work out the name later.
瑞秋  你的猫在我碗里干嘛012---Rachel, what is your cat doing in one of my bowls?
不是啦  我在解冻鸡肉012---It's not. I'm defrosting a chicken.
我把威丝克森太太卖掉了012---Oh, I sold, uh, Mrs. Whiskerson.
谢天谢地012---Oh, thank God.
你的钱拿回来没012---Did you get your money back?
有  一千五百美元012---Yeah, $1500.
哇  你还有赚啊012---Wow, you made a profit?
我是来拿红丝绒枕头的012---I just came for the red velvet pillow.
在这里  瑞秋  谢了012---Oh yeah, There you go. Thanks, Rachel.
别忘了  你随时可以来看他012---And, uh, don't forget, you can come visit her any time you want.
好  我会记得的012---Oh, good. Great. I'll keep that in mind.
这是啥  某种蛇吗012---Ahem, hey. So what is this? some kind of snake or something?
我真喜欢和你一起醒来  我也是012---I really like waking up with you. I like waking up with you too.
今天早上真美012---Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

好  我孩子气012---Okay, I'm the baby.
嘿  不要啊012---Hey. Stop it
嗨  钱德  你怎么会在这里012---Hey. Chandler! What are you doing here?
乔伊在华盛顿大桥上 把我赶下车012---Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
为什么012---Why?
不知道  他突然发疯  我们在玩快问快答的游戏012---I don't know. He went crazy. Y'know, We were playing that game where you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
没有我在场监督  绝对不能玩那个游戏012---Oh, that game should not be played without my supervision.
我不知道他干嘛气成那样012---Well, I don't know what made him mad.
我只是说他这次不会翻身012---All I said was that, uh, I didn't think this was gonna be his big break...
说这部电影帮不了他012---...that this movie wasn't gonna do anything for him...
说这部电影很像是幌子012---...and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie.
好啦  他该把我推下桥才对012---Okay, he should've pushed me off the bridge.
你袋子里有什么012---What's in the bag?
我猜想你们大家也会对我不爽012---Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me...
所以我在路边捡了些礼物012---...so I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.
谁要一条腿的泰迪熊  我要012---Who wants the teddy bear with one leg? I do.
来了012---Okay.
差远了  好啦  你帮我  我没办法012---Not even close. Okay, then y'know what? I need help! I can't do this!
来  我帮你012---Okay! All right! Let's do it!
坐下 好012---All right. Sit down.
头往后仰  好012---All right, put your head back. All right. Yes. Okay.
把眼睛张开  好  张开了012---Now, open your eyes. Okay, they are.
我举了几只手指头  四只012---How many fingers am I holding up? Four.
天啊  我心里想的也是四只012---Oh, my God, I was thinking four.
真的  是啊012---Really? Yes.
这样吧   我们先来预演次  好012---All right, y'know what? why don't we start with a practice one, okay?
不滴眼药水  太好了012---No drops. Great.
数到三   一  二  三012---On three. One, two, three.
你害的我沙发枕都湿了012---Now my pillow's all wet.
你自己说是预演的012---Well, well, you said it was practice!
那你干嘛动  因为我知道你在骗我012---Then why did you move? Because I knew you were lying.
好吧  过来  你要干嘛012---All right. Come here. Come on. What are you doing?
摩妮卡  天啊  住手012---Monica, Stop it! Oh, my God, stop it.
我要  转回来012---I am going… I'm going--Turn it over!
我要把眼药水  滴进你眼睛012---Aah!I am going to get Get these drops in your eye.
天啊  你的蛮力真大012---Oh, my God. You really are freakishly strong.
摩妮卡  住手012---Aah! Aah! Monica, stop it!
可恶  滴完了012---Damn, it's empty.
如果现在乔伊和钱德走进来  我们就发了012---Wow. y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune.
一定是钱德  乔伊或罗斯012---Ooh, that is definitely Chandler, Joey or Ross.
或是瑞秋012---Or Rachel.
喂012---Hello?
是乔伊012---It's Joey.
真高兴你打来  钱德都说了  他很难过012---I'm so glad you called. Chandler told me what happened. He's really upset.
等他知道他毛衣的下场  他一定会更难过012---Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests.
你把他的毛衣怎么了012---What did you do to his sweater vests?
这么说吧  在俄玄俄州  有一伙打扮亮丽的狗012---Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.
摩妮卡  菲比在吗  我有车子的事要问她012---Monica, listen, is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
她在  你等等012---Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
嗨  嗨  菲比012---Hey, dude. Hey, Pheebs.
你听我说  座位底下有个木盒滑出来  那是什么012---Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What is it?
那是我祖母012---Oh, that's my grandma.
乔伊  谢谢你  她玩得很愉快012---And thanks, Joey. She's having a really great time.
是乔伊吗  是乔伊吗  我要跟他说012---Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.
乔伊  钱德在这儿  不知道你012---Joey, Chandler's here. He was wondering if...
我想他零钱正好用完了012---Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
他连话都不想跟我说  这样我要怎么跟他道歉012---Y'know, He won't even talk to me. How am I gonna apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
或许你应该寄点东西给他012---Maybe you should send him something.
等他到了赌城  就知道你想表达歉意了012---So when he gets to Las Vegas, he'll know that you're sorry.
好主意  上哪儿找一堆成人A片呢012---That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn?
不行  不能用成人片道歉啦  真的012---Oh, no,  don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn! Really?
你应该寄一条烟过去  他可以用来换取保护012---You know what you should send him? A carton of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. 
错了  监狱里才是这样012---No. That's prison.
菲比  我知道要怎么找出原因了012---Okay, Pheebs. I know how we're gonna figure this out.
好  什么都不要想012---Okay. Clear your mind...
想到什么就直接回答012---...and answer the first thing that comes into your head.
好了吗012---Okay?
你比较喜欢植物还是动物  动物012---What do you like better flora or fauna Fauna. Fauna.
你想当赛门还是葛芬柯  葛芬柯012---Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle? Garfunkel.
你为何生我的气  因为你说我很无趣012---Why are you mad at me? You said I was boring. Oh.
我何时说过你无趣了012---When did I say you were boring?
天啊  我想起来了  我们下西洋棋那次012---Oh, my God, I remember now. We were playing chess.
菲比  我和你没下过西洋棋012---Phoebe, you and I have never played chess.
有啦  记得冰冻湖那次吗  我们玩西洋棋  你说我很无趣012---Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring,
然后你脱下面具  变成了卡麦蓉狄亚012---and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!.
好吧  这有可能是梦境012---Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
嘿  史丹利  嘿012---Hey. Stanley. Hey.
你的主角来了  咱们开工吧012---Your leading man is here. Let's get to work.
计划有些改变   我们停拍了012---Um, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
什么  为什么012---What? Why?
钱的原因吧  我们没钱012---It's a money thing. We don't have any.
你在开玩笑吧  不是012---Ha, ha. You're kidding, right? No.
什么012---What?
这或许只是暂时的012---It's probably just temporary.
我们希望能快点筹到资金  你先撑一下012---We're hoping to get more money soon, so if you could just, uh, hang out.
撑一下  要撑多久012---Hang out? How long?
不知道  一周  或许两个星期吧012---I don't know. A week. Maybe two.
资金会出现的  大家都爱投资拍片012---The money'll turn up. People always wanna invest in movies.
你该不会是有钱人吧  我不是012---Hey, you're not rich, are you? No.
问一下也无妨012---Worth a shot.
乔伊  让我知道你在哪儿落脚012---Well, Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
老兄  你是乔伊崔比亚尼吗  我是012---Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani? Yeah.
这是有人留给你的  谢了012---These got left for you. Thanks.
" 恭喜你翻身了"012---"Congratulations on your big break."
喂012---Hello?
摩妮卡  我是乔伊012---Monica, it's Joey.
乔伊  你当了大明星还记得我012---Hey, Joey.Aw, you remember me even though you're a big star.
得了吧   忘记你也要好几年012---Aw, come on. It'll be years before I forget you.
乔伊  拍片现场是什么样子012---Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?
你有自己的更衣室吗  有专属的私人座椅吗012---Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
有啊  一切都在进行当中012---Uh, yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.
你一定要跟钱德说  他完完全全看走眼了012---Listen, uh, make sure you tell Chandler he couldn't have been more wrong.
摩妮卡  我得挂了  我的寿司送来了012---Uh-oh, I gotta go, Monica. My, uh, sushi's here.
抱歉  多谢你们等我  没关系012---Sorry about that. Thanks for waiting. Okay.
大家笑一个  好了  多谢012---Everybody smile. Okay. Thanks a lot.
希望你们在凯萨住得愉快  祝福你们" 罗马" 精神012---Enjoy your stay at Caesar's. We hope it's toga-rific.
杀了我  杀了我吧012---Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now.
瑞秋  《电视指南》递给我好吗  好啊012---Hey, Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?  Yeah.

三  四个小时后再见012---We'll see you in about three or four hours.
喂012---Hello?
喂  乔伊  菲比  帮我个忙好吗012---Hey, Joey! Hey, Pheebs. Listen, uh Can you do me a favor?
我忘记提款卡的密码  你可以帮我去找吗012---I forgot the PIN to my ATM card. Can you get it for me?
好啊  在哪里  我刻在提款机的角落那里012---Sure. Where is it? Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine on the corner.
原来5639是你的密码012---Oh, so you're 5-6-3-9?
没错  菲比  谢了012---That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
你要跟钱德说话吗012---Do you wanna talk to Chandler?
是乔伊吗  让我跟他说012---Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.
不要  他不相信我的电影012---No. He didn't believe in my movie...
他大错特错  这次的电影是真的012---...which is a big mistake, because it is real. Real.
我这星期都试着跟他道歉  若他不让我在电话上说012---Y'know what? I've tried to apologize in all week. If I can't do it on the phone,
我就直接杀过去当面说012---I'll go down there and do it in person.
菲比  我听到了  请他听电话012---Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Uh, can you put him on?
好012---Yeah.
嘿  你别过来012---Hey. Don't come out here.
不行  我百分之百支持你  我要当面证明给你看012---No-no-no-no, I support you 100 percent and I wanna prove that to you in person.
收到  我原谅你  你别过来012---I got that. I forgive you. Don't come out here.
原谅我  你一星期都不接我电话012---Forgive me? You haven't taken my calls for a week.
钱德  我早都不介意了  咱们是一辈子的朋友012---Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever.

老友记  第五季  第23集  拉斯维加斯之旅（上集）012---Friends  S05E23  The One In Vegas
摩妮卡  抱歉我迟到了012---Monica? I'm sorry I'm late.
摩妮卡012---Monica?
菲比012---Phoebe?
真对不起012---I'm so sorry.
你到很久了吗   没关系啦012---Have you been here long? That's okay.
你怎么拖了那么久012---What the hell took you so long?
好  不许你跟钱德说012---Okay, you can't tell Chandler.
我遇见了理查012---That I ran into Richard.
哪个理查  那个理查012---Which Richard? The Richard.
理查西蒙斯  天啊012---Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!
不是啦  是我前男友理查012---No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
个子高高  有胡子那个012---You know, the tall guy, mustache.
好吧  这就说得过去了012---Okay, that actually makes more sense.
情况如何012---How was it?
好极了  我们先是闲聊012---It was, it was really nice. We started talking 
后来一起吃了个午饭012---and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
怪了  我有梦到你跟理查吃饭012---That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
真的  不过是跟理查西蒙斯啦012---Really? But again, Simmons.
你继续说  奇怪的是虽然他很棒012---Go on. The strange part was he was really nice...
也很帅  但是我对他完全没感觉了012---and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
那为什么不能跟钱德说012--- Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
因为他听了一定会发神经012---Because it would totally freak him out
明天就是我们的纪念日  我不想搞砸012---and tomorrow's our anniversary. I don't wanna spoil that.
不敢相信你们交往一年了012---Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
哇  我欠瑞秋20美元012---Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.
什么  那是完全不相干的赌局啦012---What? On a totally different bet.
嘿012---Hey!
一周年纪念日快到了012---It's almost our anniversary!
我知道012---I know.
你相信吗  一年前的今天  我还是只是烦人的朋友钱德012---Can you believe it? One year ago today, I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
现在你是我烦人的朋友钱德012---Aw, now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
我帮你买了礼物   纪念日明天才到012---Huh.  I got you a present! Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
我知道  但你今天就要开礼物  好吧012---I know, but you have to open it today. Okay.
我来啦012---Okay! There you go!
两张去赌城的机票012---It's two tickets to Vegas! Wow.
这周末的来回机票012---Yeah! For this weekend!
一定很完美  不但能去看乔伊  还能在飞机上开始过纪念日012---Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane.
就叫做 "飞机纪念日"吧012---We can call it our "Plane-a-versary."
一定要这样叫012---We have to?
不用啦012---No.
这是很棒没错  但乔伊说了不要我们过去012---Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
他只是怕麻烦我们而已012---Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble.
想想到时候我们突然出现  他一定超兴奋的012---Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! 
而且我们自己还有 "赌城纪念日"012---Plus, we get to have our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!
"内华达纪念日"012---"A-Nevadaversary!"
对  我们该开始和别人交往012---Yeah, I think we should see other people.
我们可以去吧   对012---We can go, right?
那就好  这是个好主意012---Yes. Okay! Great idea.
好啊  我也要去012---Okay, I'm gonna go too!
菲比  这是我俩的纪念日012---Y'know Pheebs, it's kind of our anniversary.
少来  休想再像上次伦敦那样把我甩掉012---Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
菲比  哪有甩掉   当时你怀了三胞胎012---Ditch you?  Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
那我不管  我非去不可012---Uh-huh. Great story. I'm going.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
注意  这周末大家一起去赌城  给乔伊一个惊喜012---Hey, you guys, Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
包括我012---Including me!
你们要去吗012---You wanna go?!
我应该可以请个几天假012---I can take a couple days off work.
你当然可以请几天假  因为这趟我也要去012---Of course you can take a couple days off, because this trip includes me!
等等  差点忘了  我明天要提报告  不能缺席012---Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
我也买了梵谷画展的票  我盼了一年才盼到012---I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit. I've been waiting like a year for this.
瑞秋  不如你我周六再飞去012---So Rach，you and I could fly out together Saturday.
听起来很可行  好  那我打电话去订票012---Sounds great. Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. Okay.
其实想起来也很不赖  我可以独自在公寓过一晚012---Yeah, Y'know，that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
对  你可以脱光光到处走012---Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
不是  我可以自己一个人 享受独处的时光012---No, so I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
脱光光的独处时光012---Naked alone time.
菲比  我想一个人独处  并不表示我就想脱光光到处走012---No! Phoebe Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
你自己一个人住  你也不会脱光光到处走啊012---You live alone, you don't walk around naked.
你以为我为什么老半天才去开门012---Uh-huh. Why does it takes me so long to answer the door?
这趟旅程到现在为止  比起伦敦那趟好还是坏012---So far, is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
菲比  到现在为止都差不多012---So far, it's pretty much the same, Pheebs.
好  那我给你们糖果之后呢012---Okay, What about after I give you these candies?
对  我想好一点了012---Yeah, I guess it's a little better now. Ha, ha.
好  赌城1分  伦敦O分012---Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas, 1. London, 0.
我马上回来012---I'll be back.
飞机纪念日快乐012---Happy Plane-a-versary.
我爱你012---Aww! I love you!
礼物能趁现在给你吗   好啊012---Can I give you your present now? Okay!
要命  不会吧012---Oh man! don't tell me I did this.
我最爱你假装没带礼物了012---I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!
那如果 "我是真的没带礼物  请你多多包涵呢"012---How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
没关系啦  别放在心上  等回去再给我就行了012---Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
纪念日发生这种事  真是再扫兴不过了012---Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
很好  你最后还是决定  要跟钱德说理查的事了012---Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
什么理查的事012---What-what Richard thing?
糟糕012---Oh, no.
什么理查的事   用西蒙斯混过去012---What "Richard thing"? Simmons. Go with Simmons.
好吧  我昨天遇到了理查012---Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday.
他问我要不要一起吃饭  我答应了012---and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.
我没跟你说是因为012---The only reason I didn't tell you because.
我知道你会生气  而我不想毁了周年纪念日012---I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
我不生气啊012---I'm not mad.
真的  是啊012---Really? Oh yeah! 
你遇到理查  一起吃饭012---Yeah,so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!
没啥大不了的012---No big deal.
太好了012---Great.
好  伦敦1分012---Okay, London, 1.
喔  怎么会这样012---Oh, look what happened.
瞧瞧我自己012---Huh, check me out.
我在自家的厨房012---I'm in my kitchen...
脱光光012---...naked.
拿起一颗柳丁012---I'm picking up an orange.
我脱光光012---I'm naked.
点起蜡烛012---lighting the candles.
脱光光  要小心012---naked, and carefully.
天啊  瑞秋真的脱光光了012---Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!
不能看  我在看书012---I can't look at that. I am looking at this.
好  鲜明的色彩  有力的笔触012---Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes.
除非她故意让我看  就另当别论了012---Unless she wants me to be looking at that.
她知道我在家012---She knows I'm home.
她知道我看得到她012---She knows I can see her.
她这是在玩什么把戏012---What kind of game is she playing?
也许今晚有人寂寞012---I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
盖勒博士  别胡思乱想   别自讨没趣了012---Oh, Dr. Geller.Stop it. You're being silly. Ha, ha.
真是这样吗012---Or am I?
讨厌012---Darn it!
嘿012---Hey.
我可以进去吗012---May I come in?
想要的话  就进来啊012---Uh, yeah, if you want to.
你要我进去吗012---Do you want me to?
当然了012---Yeah, sure?
彼此彼此012---So do I.
瑞秋  在一切还没开始之前012---Okay, Rach, before anything happens...
有几个原则我想先说清楚012---...I wanna lay down a couple of ground rules.
这只适用于今晚012---This is just about tonight.
今晚过后  你是你  我是我012---I won't go through with this if it'll raise the question of "us."
好吗  我希望这一切012---Okay? I just want this to be...
只是各取所需012---...about what it is.
罗斯  什么各取所需012---And, um...what is that, Ross?
出自于兽欲的性爱012---The physical act of love.
什么  你疯了不成012---What, are you crazy?
所以你刚才脱光光  不是在勾引我012---Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your nakedness?
天啊  你有看到012---Oh, God. You saw me?
你脱光光不是在勾引我012---You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness?
当然不是  你当真以为我想跟你上床012---Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?
才不是呢012---No.
不是012---No!
不  不  不是012---No, no, no, no.
你们等等啊012---Hey, you guys, wait!
等等我  这地方比伦敦好多了吧012---You guys. This place is so much better than London. Okay?
有个打扮成埃及艳后的女士  给了我这张折价票012---This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon,
不用一块美元  就能吃到牛排龙虾晚餐012---Ninety-nine cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh.
菲比  你又不吃肉012---Phoebe, You don't eat animals.
不用一美元  我连你都吃012---For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.
我完全可以耗在这里  我要的东西应有尽有012---Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want.
就连乔伊都在  你们看012---Including Joey! Look!

你的保险套真不赖012---Love your condoms, my man.
你们怎么会在这里  不是要你们别来了嘛012---What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
你干嘛打扮成神鬼战士012---Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
因为我正在拍戏  我扮演神鬼战士012---Uh, because I'm shooting a scene right now.Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator.
你们等等012---Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.
可以卡一下吗  我朋友来了  我要休息一下012---Can we cut? My friends are here. I'm gonna take a break.
你是在跟谁说话012---Who are you talking to?
导演啊  就是她012---The director.Uh, her.
好啦  我不是在拍神鬼战士  我在这里工作012---All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
为什么  发生了什么事012---Why? What happened?
那部电影因为没钱而停拍012---The movie shutdown because they ran out of money,
我在这里工作  等电影重新开拍  如果真有这一天的话012---so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
我真的很遗憾012---I'm so sorry. Such a drag.
对不起   没跟你们说  抱歉012---Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
没关系  互相隐瞒显然成了新的规矩012---No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
我就知道你听了会有疙瘩012---I knew you weren't okay with that.
你是神鬼战士012---So you're a gladiator!
他们怎么了012---Yeah, what-what's going on?
摩妮卡跟理查吃了中饭012---Monica had lunch with Richard.
理查道森012---Dawson?
不是啦  要不然一定超酷的012---No...But that would've been so cool!
是那个男朋友理查012---Her boyfriend Richard.
那根本不碍事  你怎么到现在还不相信我012---It meant nothing. Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
你瞒着我跟大胡子帅哥吃午餐  要我怎么相信你012---When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
你说的对  对不起  我早该跟你说的012---You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
谢谢  这样才对嘛012---Thanks. Aww, there we go.

功亏一篑012---Ooh, so close.
下不为例  你不能再跟他见面012---There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
我不能跟他见面  你不能对我发号施令012---I cannot see him? You can't tell me what to do.
很有趣   刚才不就是了012---That's so funny, because I think I just did!
你这种态度  我眼不见为净  我无所谓012---Oh y'know what? If you act like this, I don't even want to be around you. Fine with me!
好  纪念日快乐012---Fine! Happy Anniversary!
你们别这样嘛  这显然是个大误会012---Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on, come on.This is obviously a misunderstanding.
才不是误会  你在说什么012---No, it's not. What're you talking about?
别看我  我只是在这里工作012---Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
罗斯  我有点热  要脱毛衣012---Okay, um, Ross? I'm a little warm, so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater. Now,

对  真是太爆笑了012---Yep, that's hilarious.
抱歉  我不闹了012---I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
昨晚对你其实也很尴尬012---You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
也不尽然  我只是没有那么容易尴尬012---No, not really. I mean I just don't embarrass that easily.
什么  你根本尴尬得要死012---What? You totally get embarrassed.
才没有  罗斯  这是因为我比你更有安全感012---No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
是吗  是啊012---Is that so? Yeah.
小姐  不管你有多想012---Hey, lady! I don't care how much you want it, okay?
我绝不会和你去厕所做爱012---I am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom!
在古罗马时代  这不只是顶帽子而已012---Hey, You know, in Roman times, this was more than just a hat.
是吗  当然了012---Really? Yeah, sure, sure.
这可以用来刷地板012---They would scrub the floors with it!
抹去鞋子上的泥巴012---They'd use it to get the mud off their shoe.
有时候  马腹会弄脏  把这个戮进去就能012---And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty.So they would stick it right...
乔伊  真不敢相信  我的周年纪念日是这样过的012---Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
但我带你去个好地方012---I'll take you someplace nice.
今天有个人赏我一百美元小费012---Look! A guy tipped me $100 bucks today. Whoa!
他玩21点  才一小时就赢了五千美元012---Yeah-yeah, He was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $5000.
你相信吗  五千美元啊012---Can you believe that? $5,000!
若我赢了五千美元  我就去加入健身房012---Y'know, If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.
把我的上半身练壮  再用棍子插理查的屁眼012---y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick.
等等   我何不效仿那个人012---Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did?
把这一百元变成五千012---I'll take this $100, and turn it into $5000
到时再连三翻  就有钱让电影重新开拍了012---...And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
祝你好运了012---Good luck.
钱德  我不需要好运012---Chandler! I don't need luck.

摩妮卡  你和钱德的关系有了小小挂折012---Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler.
有啥大不了的  不过是钱德罢了012---Big deal. It's only Chandler.
我真的很遗憾012---I am so sorry.
我们吵架的理由太蠢了  我根本不想再跟理查见面012---This is crazy! it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
那就去挽回啊  去找钱德  他八成就待在你房间里012---So go fix it. Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room.
跟他说对不起  说你爱他012---Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
