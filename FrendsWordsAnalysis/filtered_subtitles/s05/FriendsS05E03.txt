哪一位是父亲012---And now, Which of you is the father?

我一定会很怀念你那样吓别人的方式012---I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
菲比012---Okay, uh Pheebs,
快看这里  这是要给宝宝看的012---Look! This is for the babies to look at someday.

真想赶快见到你们  请不要弄痛我012---Can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me.
你们怎么那么慢012---What took you so long?
两辆车是一起出发的012---Your cab left when ours did.
我们回去拿我的外套012---We went back because I forgot my jacket.
你没穿外套啊012---You-you're not wearing a jacket.
真是的  我又忘了012---Oh, man! I did it again!
得有人通知法兰克和爱丽丝012---Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice.
我妈也想  乔伊  你干什么012---And then My mom might... Joey, What are you doing?

老友记  第五季  第03集  三胞胎012---Friends  S05E03  The One Hundredth
菲比  我们问过护士了  你的医生之所以迟到012---Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse. The reason your doctor is late...
是因为她不来了012---...is because, uh, she's not coming.
什么  实际上是她洗澡的时候摔破了头012---What? Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
天哪  那个蠢女人012---Oh, my God. She's so stupid!
菲比  不会有事的012---Pheebs-Pheebs it's going to be okay.
你说得倒轻松  你的阴道又没有3个宝宝要出来012---That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out of your vagina.
听着  护士说这个医生很好012---Listen. y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
对  他是妇产科主任012---Yeah, He's head of the department.
好吧  老天爷救救我012---All right. Ooh. Oh, dear God, save me.
第一次阵痛来了012---I'm having my first contraction.
还好嘛  好012---Oh, it's not bad. Okay.
生命的奇迹开始了  哎呦  我012---And so the miracle of birth begins. And I...
你没事吧012---You okay?
有个地方好痛012---Something hurts.
是感同身受   好感人喔012---Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Oh, that's so sweet.
我不知道我有那么在意012---Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
你好  你好012---Hello. Hi.
菲比  我是哈洛医生  我负责替你接生012---Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad. I'll be delivering your babies.
有我在你放心  我是老手了012---I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time.
我马上回来帮你做检查012---I'll be back in a minute to do your internal,
你先放轻松   目前一切都很好012---in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great.
还有  我爱方奇(电视剧Happy Days里的人物)012---And also, I love Fonzie.
他刚才说他爱方奇吗012---Did he just say he loves Fonzie?
听起来是012---That's what it sounded like.
好012---All right.
嘿012---Hey!
我来晚了吗  还没有人出来吧012---Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
没有  还没开始呢   爱丽丝呢012---No-no-no! we haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
在德拉威  不过她正在赶来  目前先由我充当教练012---Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach.
放心  她有教我心理助产什么的012---But don't worry, She told me about the LaMazda stuff.
就是在月底前生产012---Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month..
就能获得2％的补助012---...they give you 2% financing.
对012---Yeah.
摩妮卡  你一定会以我为荣012---Monica, you're going to be very proud of me.
我帮我们约到两个俏护士012---I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
喔  是吗012---Oh, my.
是男看护012---They're male nurses.
在我想像中不是012---Heh, heh. Not in my head.
不管怎样  他们约我们周六晚上出去  如何012---Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night. What do you say?
这个012---Um...
我看算了  什么012---I don't think so. What?
什么叫算了012---What are you talking about?
是你劝我忘记罗斯向前看的012---You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
我向前看了  你得陪我012---I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on,
给我一个好的理由  你为什么不去012---give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
不如你说一个理由012---Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason ...
我再告诉你是对是错012---...and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
什么  没那么简单吧012---What? Harder than it sounds, isn't it?
总之你也要去  我还答应他们下班012---Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off ...
一起到咖啡厅吃点儿果冻012---...that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
没错  人永远吃得下果冻012---Yep. There's always room for Jello.
你为什么能说得那么色012---Joey, how do you make that dirty?
很简单  我什么都能说得很色012---It's easy. I can do it with anything. Watch uh,
奶奶的鸡肉沙拉012---Grandma's chicken salad...
罗斯012---Ross!
拍这里012---Get a shot of this.
这是你们出生当天的头条012---Hey, babies, these are the headlines when you were born.
女宝宝把头转开  男宝宝012---Okay, now girl baby, turn away. And boy babies...
看看012---...check it out.
这就是你出生当月的裸女012---This is what naked women looked like the month you were born.
好的  尽情欣赏吧012---All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff
好  阵痛又来了012---Oh, okay, I'm having another one!
我有点希望已经生了012---Ooh, I was kind of hoping that was it.
摩妮卡和瑞秋呢012---Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
可能跟约她们的护士在一起012---A couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
是吗  男看护012---Really? Male nurses?
对  我也很失望012---Yeah, I was bummed too.
她们要去约会012---So they're going on dates?
什么时候  星期六吧012---When? I think Saturday.
他怎么了  他感同身受012---What's with him? Um, sympathy pains.
我本来挺感动的  可是现在我觉得他在抢我的风头012---I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's trying to steal my thunder.
好012---Okay.
来看看你怎么样了012---Let's see what we got here.
你知道吗  方奇跟三胞胎约过会012---Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.
你一直提到的这位方奇012---This-this Fonzie person you keep referring to...
他是另一位医生吗012---...is that another doctor?
不是012---Oh no-no-no.
方奇是亚瑟方塞瑞利的昵称012---Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli.
也叫方子012---The Fonz.
好012---All right.
很快了012---Soon.
其实不会很怪吧012---It's not that weird, is it?
怪得不得了012---It's very weird.
我才不要听某人告诉我  我扩张了"一滴滴"012---I don't want some guy down there telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."
老实说  他不是在模仿方奇012---To be fair, He doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
干嘛替他辩解  去帮我另外找一个012---Why are you defending him? Just get me another doctor...
没有发疯  不是方奇的医生012---...One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
其实他不是012---Again, it's not that he…Aah! Aah!
你在这里012---Oh-hey-hey-hey! there you are.
有件事应该让你知道012---Um, listen there's something I think you should know.
是你要跟护士约会的事吗  我听乔伊说了012---Is this about you dating the nurse? Joey told me.
我一点也不在意  你和我又没什么012---and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing
我们只是玩玩012---Just goofing around.
其实我是想告诉你  我打算推掉012---Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it,
既然我们只是玩玩  那我就跟他出去好了012---but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
好  那我也要012---Fine. Maybe I will too.
喂  你们看我去礼品部012---Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the gift shop...
起来  快起来012---Oh. Get up! Get up! Get up!
菲比012---Okay, Pheebs?
这是欧伯曼医生012---This is Dr. Oberman.
他对方奇或《欢乐时光》 的所有人物...012---He has no strong feelings about Fonzie...
都没什么感觉012---...or any of the Happy Days gang.
你要升几年级012---Hi! you're going into what grade?
我刚升住院医师  常有人那样问我  我提前...012---I'm actually a first-year resident. but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early…
我也是012---Uh-huh. Me too.
罗斯  或许我应该强调  我是要已成年的医师012---Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
我绝对有能力012---Really, I'm fully qualified...
闭嘴012---Shh, Doogie. Shh.
到底有没有人了解我快生了012---Doesn't anybody understand that I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh?
你走  走啊  小毛头012---Go! Go little boy, go!
你真行  你把他弄哭了012---Oh, cool. You made him cry!
崔比亚尼先生  你有肾结石012---Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
有别的可能吗012---Uh, well, what else could it be?
就是肾结石012---It's kidney stones.
或是...012---Or...
肾结石012---Kidney stones.
差不多了012---All right, You're getting there.
这些宝宝很幸运012---Oh, and y'know, These babies are very, very lucky.
是吗  为什么012---They are? Why?
他们的生日日期是方子的一半012---They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
生日快乐012---Happy birthday.
我澄清一下012---Just to clarify.
我不是方奇012---I'm not Fonzie.
说真的  你能替你弟生孩子真的很棒012---Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you,I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
的确  对啊012---I know, it is. Yeah.
我可以告诉你个秘密吗  你说012---Can I tell you a little secret? Yeah.
我要自己留一个012---I want to keep one.
天哪   我会上新闻012---Oh, I'm going to be on the news.
菲比  别开玩笑了012---Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding.
你明知你不能这么做012---You know you can't keep one of these babies.
为什么  搞不好可以  你怎么知道012---Why not? Maybe I can. You don't know.
我当然知道  法兰克他们一定三个都要012---Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice will want to keep all their children.
不一定  你确定012---Maybe not. You know?
说实话  三个宝宝很费事的012---Seriously, three babies are a handful.
也许他们正在找机会送走一个012---maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them.
我不想因为没开口而失去机会012---Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity because I didn't ask.
菲比  这件事太扯了012---Phoebe, no. This is insane.
你就问问看嘛012---Just ask him.
什么  我去问012---What? Me?
我不能自己问012---I can't ask him!
你知道那样多不成体统吗012---Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?
总之你去找法兰克谈  好嘛012---All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank. Okay?
探探他的口风012---Just, y'know, feel him out!
不行  我怎么能叫法兰克  送你一个孩子012---No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids.
你说得对012---You're right.
就说是你要的012---Tell him it's for you.
好一点了吗  亲爱的012---Feeling better, sweetie?
一点点吧012---Maybe a little.
真希望你没看到我吐012---Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
我也希望012---Me too.
我刚刚听说  怎么回事012---Hey. I just heard. What's up?
肾结石012---Kidney stones.
通常我们会用冲击波震碎结石012---Ordinarily, Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break the stones up with shock waves.
但你的结石已经太靠近膀胱012---But they're too close to the bladder now.
我们要不要等你排尿排出来  或是从尿道往上伸进去012---Which means we can either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
不  不行  不能往上伸012---No, no, no. Nothing is going "up," okay?
绝对不考虑往上   尿道是什么012---"Up" is not an option. What's a urethra?
你疯了吗012---Are you crazy?
你问他了吗012---So did you ask him?
我还没有机会跟他独处012---No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
我的时间有限012---I'm kind of on a clock here.
方奇012---Oh, Fonzie.
我一直都很喜欢魔克012---You know who I always liked? Mork.
收回  收回012---Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
方奇过见魔克012---Fonzie met Mork.
魔克把方奇结冻012---Mork froze Fonzie.
对012---Yeah...
对012---Yes...
但是方奇本来就很酷"冷"012---...but Fonzie was already cool.
所以他不会有事  对吧012---So he wasn't hurt. Right?
也对012---Yeah, that's right.
你好吗012---How you doing?
很好  医生说随时都会生012---Okay. Doctor says any minute now.
爱丽丝马上就会到012---You know, Alice is going to be here so soon.
你能不能帮个忙  先hold住他们012---You couldn't just do me a favor and, like, hold them in?
抱歉  我正在处理你请我帮的最后一个忙012---Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
嘿  瑞秋  嗨012---Hey, Rachel. Hi!

这只是为了挣钱  好上完医学院012---I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
而且海湾战争时  感觉没那么娘娘腔012---And it didn't feel "girlie" during the Gulf War.
那当然012---Sure.
感谢你保家卫国012---Thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
何必等到星期六  你明天有空吗012---So, Why wait till Saturday? Are you free tomorrow?

"两个好朋友  非常在乎对方012---"Two friends who care a lot about each other...
在床上很"性"福012---...and have amazing sex...
