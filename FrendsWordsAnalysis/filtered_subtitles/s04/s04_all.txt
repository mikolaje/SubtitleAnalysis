特雷盖说  地下室的东西我们随便拿012---Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement.

我真是绝望透了012---How desperate am I?

我刚刚告诉我妈   帮她的晚会准备食物012---I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
为什么这样做   因为我需要钱012---How come? -Because I need the money
而且我那点仅存的自尊  不要也罢012---and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
别这样  这是一件好事012---Come on, I think this is a good thing.
老妈若不是觉得你厨艺精湛  才不会雇你呢012---I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
你犯不着替她说好话   她又听不见012---You don't have to stick up for her. She can't hear you.
你有水果汁吗012---Do you have any juice?
只有泡菜012---Just pickle.
瑞秋  昨天很有趣  我在街上碰见乔安娜了012---Hey, Rach, funny story. I, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
我的老板  乔安娜  很惨吧012---My boss, Joanna? That must have been awkward.
不  实际上  她只是问我是否想一起喝一杯012---Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
你没答应她吧012---You, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
没有  没有012---No! No!
嘿  瑞秋012---Hello, Rachel.
起初我没答应012---Well, not at first.
她在这里做什么012---What is she doing here?
上次你跟她约会以后  还说她是个反应迟钝的笨女人012---I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
我过早对她下结论了012---Well, I think I judged her too quickly,
现在我跟她可以做进一步的发展012---and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
上次我差点被开除  你必须跟她绝交  立刻012---Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
我又不是天天有艳遇012---Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me!
通常我都是独处的012---I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
钱德  答应我012---Chandler! Promise me.
跟她断交012---you will end this now.
好吧   我答应   谢谢012---Okay, I promise, I'll end it. Thank you.
希望你知道  我为了你牺牲很大012---I hope you know what I'm giving up for you
她可不光是你的老板而己  懂吗012---because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
抱歉  我只是了解他的意思012---Sorry. I knew what he meant.
大厨进展的如何了012---How's the hired help?
很顺利  法式咸派快好了012---Doing great. Quiches are coming along.
这是什么  蓝色指甲油012---What's this? Blue nail polish?
我觉得很好看012---Yeah, I thought it was cute.
你祖母死后  我们发现时  她的手就这样012---Ha. It's what your grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
我想问你一个问题012---Let me ask you a question.
为什么你要雇我012---Why did you hire me?
理查德一直说他晚会的派对餐点很棒012---Well Richard raved about the food at his party...
当然  那时你和他睡过012---of course you were sleeping with him.
而且我听说  在那个女同性恋的婚礼上012---Then I heard the food at that lesbian
你的菜也大受欢迎012---wedding was very nice.
我假定你没和那里的什么人睡过012---I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there.
所以  我认为你可能有两把刷子012---Though, at least that would be something.
天啊  你听到了吗012---Oh, my God! Did you hear that?
她雇我是因为  她认为我很优秀012---She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
我没听见012---I didn't hear that.
她不是可怜我012---Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity.
不是想在朋友面前刁难我012---it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends,
她是真的觉得我行012---she actually thinks I'm good.
喔   如果你是个同性恋就太酷了012---Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
下午好  你是一家之主吗012---Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
你有大百科全书吗012---Do you currently own a set of encyclopedias?
没有  你可以查查分类广告  卖什么的都有012---No, but try the classifieds. People sell everything in there.
实际上  我不是要买  我是要卖012---Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling.
我想问你一个问题012---Let me ask you one question.
朋友们聊天的时候012---Do your friends ever have a conversation...
你只能跟着点头   却搞不懂他们在说什么012---and you just nod along, even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
我告诉你  这是违反宪法的012---I'm telling you, it's totally unconstitutional.
没错  完全同意012---I hear you. Yeah it is. I totally agree.
我觉得他应该得诺贝尔奖012---I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
才怪012---No.
很像阿尔冈昆族小孩的桌子012---It was like the Algonquin kids table.
抱歉  对不起012---Excuse me. I'm sorry.
这两分半钟   你什么也没有说012---You haven't said anything for about two minutes.
你有兴趣吗012---Are you at all interested?
有  有… 进来012---Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah. Come on in.
怪了  什么012---That's weird. What?
你的指甲012---Your nails.
我知道  我从不戴假指甲的012---I know, I never wear fake ones.
我怕咬指甲被我妈抱怨012---I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
不  我的意思是  你现在只有九个指甲012---No, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
等一下012---Wait a minute.
刚才还是十个012---I had them when I put...
天啊  在咸派饼里012---Oh, my God! It's in the quiche!
天啊  别着急012---Oh, my God! Okay, don't panic.
我现在就去商店  帮你买一套新指甲012---I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails.
神不知鬼不觉  你看起来还是很美012---No one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great.
但是问题是  他们会吃到那只的012---Oh. Oh, it's because they're gonna eat... That's the problem.
亲爱的  不要咬你的指甲012---Honey, don't bite your nails.
好吧  别惊慌012---Okay, please don't freak out.
不过有个咸派里  有我的一片蓝指甲012---but, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups.
谁也不知道是哪一个杯子012---And there's no way to know which one.
找到指甲可以中大奖012---And whoever finds it wins the prize!
我没惊慌012---I'm not freaking out.
那你笑什么  没事  你爸输给我5美元012---Then why are you laughing? It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
什么  你打赌我会掉一个指甲吗012---What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
别傻了   我打赌我会用上这个012---Don't be silly. I just bet that I'd need these.
冰冻宽面条012---Frozen lasagnas? Mm.
你赌我会搞砸012---You bet that I'd screw up?
"你雇我是因为我很优秀"  都是假的...012---So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
不  不  不  那是真的012---No, that was all true.
准备备用食物  只是怕你又"很莫妮卡"012---This was just in case you "pulled a Monica."
你答应过外恩博格教授   不再这么说了012---You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
拜托  有点幽默感嘛012---Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour
你总是不懂得自嘲012---you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
没错012---That's right.Ha, ha.
我妈从没信任过我  好好笑012---My mom doesn't have any faith in me. Oh, that's hilarious.
我不觉得好笑012---I don't get it.
不   我信任你012---No. I have faith.
不   你只是有烤宽面条012---No. You have lasagnas!
报废的咸派烤好了012---The ruined quiches are ready.
怎么没有...分手的感觉012---It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
的确分手了  我好伤心012---No, we are. I'm sad.
好吧012---Okay!
说012---Yes.
不能等到明天吗  好吧012---Can't you wait until tomorrow? All right.

你做什么012---What are you doing?
我穿衣服  为什么012---I'm getting dressed. Why?
我光溜溜走出去  会有人朝我扔东西012---When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
等一下  给你看些东西012---Wait. I want to show you something.
什么012---What is it?

把手并拢012---Put your hands together.
你不是我的老板012---You're not the boss of me.
你是012---Yeah, you are.
好调皮012---Saucy!
2分钟后我就回来012---I'll be back in two minutes.
你就这样离开我012---You're going to leave me like this?
你就乖乖地坐在这里等我  感觉让人兴奋012---Knowing you're here waiting for me. I think that's kind of exciting.
好的  但如果你不能马上回来012---Okay. But if you don't come back soon...
我也不能怎么样012---there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
我给你带了蛋白杏仁饼干012---I brought you back a macaroon!
太好了  我会把它贴在屁股上012---Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
奇怪  她把门锁上了012---That's weird. She locked the door.
你知道为什么吗  里面有圣诞节奖金名单012---You know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there.
我早晨看见她在写012---I saw her working on it this morning.
好吧  你发誓不告诉别人012---Okay, swear you won't tell.
马克离开前给了我一把乔安娜办公室的钥匙012---but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office.
你想看清单吗  想012---You want to see the list? Yeah.
嗨012---Hi.

手拷的钥匙在门的后面012---The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door.
你可以乖乖012---Could you be a doll...

顺便说一下  你的长裤套装很可爱012---And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
你发誓你和她分手了012---You promised you would break up with her.
我是和她分手了  只不过她分得很狂野012---I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
你都没想过  这样会破坏我的事业吗012---And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
我想过啊012---It did enter my mind.
但是情况有变   打开手铐012---But then something happened that made it shoot right out.
钱德  你作茧自缚  你自己想办法012---You know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
别... 我开不了手拷012---No..I can't get myself right out of them!
你把我跟 "脱逃大师钱德" 搞混了012---You must have me confused with the "Amazing Chandler"!
快点  你必须帮我012---Come on, you have to unlock me,
她要好几个小时后才能回来  我很冷  而且012---she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and...

等一下  你打算怎么跟乔安娜交代012---Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
交代什么012---About what?
她看见你不在了  就知道是我放你走的012---When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out,
我会被炒鱿鱼的012---and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
我会编个故事   我很擅长说慌012---I'll make something up! I'm good at lying!
实际上我借过你的随身听012---I actually did borrow your Walkman!
我无法解释  她知道我有她办公室的钥匙012---No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office.
我得把你铐回去012---I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
噢  想都别想012---Oh, I don't think so.
这样好多了012---Well, this is much better.

把你该干的话做好  我们把那叫做"很莫妮卡"012---Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that "pulling a Monica."

"耶  他很莫妮卡"012---"Yeah, he pulled a Monica." You know?
消防队员救了一个孩子  人们就会说"耶  他很莫妮卡"012---Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."

反正你都会有麻烦  明白吗012---Look, you're in trouble either way! Okay?
她回来看见我被锁在这边012---If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair...
知道你进来过  还不如让我走012---she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
我帮你打扫一个月浴室   还是洗不干净012---What if I clean your bathroom for a month? It still wouldn't be clean.

我想到了012---I've got it!
你才没辙呢012---You don't have it.
我胜券在握012---I have so got it!
这件事会传出去  挡也挡不住012---There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it.
索菲知道  莫妮卡和菲比也知道012---Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
她们怎么会知道  我给她们打电话012---How do Monica and Phoebe know? I called them.
如果她们问我看见了什么012---And when they ask me what I saw...

里克和我一拍即合  我们正想更进一步012---Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out,
老板就走了进来  以为我是个妓女  开除了我012---and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
你被开除了  我的天012---You got fired? Oh, my gosh!

我无可救药  简直想掐死自己012---That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat...
每一天每一分每一秒都爱着她012---in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day...
我都在怨恨  为何是你先认识她012---I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
很不错012---That's pretty good.

你知道  下班回家会把夹克扔到椅子上012---You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
就象这样  在她家是扔到一堆垃圾上012---Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage.
那也不是夹克  是一堆垃圾012---And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage.

你能不能帮我一把012---Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
好  这样  你为什么不退掉这本书  让乔伊送她那支时钟笔012---All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen...
你送个更差的东西  比如…012---...and you get her something worse than that...
一支普通的笔012---...like a regular pen.
她真的会喜欢这个  你知道012---She's really going to love this, you know?

钱没付清之前  我们不会走的012---and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. ...
知道为什么吗  女士  我们只是临时承包  没别的地方可以去012---'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.

《天鹅绒兔宝宝》012---The Velveteen Rabbit?
我觉得跟你有关012---I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.

乔伊送我的时候说012---Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said,
"因为我知道你喜欢兔子  也喜欢起司"012---"This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese."
谢谢  我好喜欢012---Thanks. I love it.
你一定花了不少功夫  这很不好找012---And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
如果你没听到  我的意思是"还好啦"012---By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
你一定很喜欢乔伊  才会这么费心012---You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.

你能让我打扫一下么012---So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
不行吗012---No?
我刚才走进浴室  竟然看见凯西光着身体012---I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked
简直是种折磨012---It was like torture.
如果你曾当过战俘  才会惊讶的知道什么叫"折磨"012---Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
情况变得越来越糟012---It just keeps getting worse and worse!
你知道么  够糟了  我居然爱上我室友的女朋友了012---Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend
而且  我觉得她也知道012---which by the way,I think she knows.
每次我们共处一室  空气就很诡异紧张012---Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us.
更叫我疯狂的是  我觉得她也喜欢我012---And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
现在我又看到她的裸体012---And now I have seen her naked.
我是说  至少看见她穿衣服的时候012---I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on,
我能想像她的身体是被树皮什么的给盖住的012---...I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.
结果没有  她是光着身子的012---But there are no boles. She's smooth.
光着的012---Smooth!
啊哦012---Wow...
他刚才那样子坐着都走光了012---Could everyone totally see up his robe?

我跟她吃饭之前要先跟凯希吃012---I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
什么012---What? Yeah.
是的  是的  更夸张的是我刚刚一个人吃了一整个披萨012---Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
慢着  你要跟凯西约会012---Wait...  You're going out with Kathy.
对  你怎么变得颠三倒四的012---Yeah. Why are you getting so upset
我是颠三倒四012---Well, I'm upset...
全是因为你012---...for you.
我是说  没完没了和各色美貌女子上床  恐怕很难满足你012---I mean,having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
那又怎样  又不是只有我们才这么干012---What's the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
听着  乔伊012---Look, Joey.
凯西很明显无法满足你的感情需求012---Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
但是凯希…012---But Casey...
老实说  我只看到过她的后脑勺012---I mean granted I only saw the back of her head,
但是我感觉得到她聪明风趣012---But I got this sense that she's smart and funny...
而且很在乎你012---...and gets you.
你真能从后脑勺看出这么多东西012---You got all that from the back of her head?
好吧  听着  我想你真的应该安定下来了012---All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down.

小泰山东尼012---"Little, tiny Tarzan,
用鼻毛荡来荡去  悠闲的荡着秋千...012---swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..."
该死的  现在我不知道该怎么接下一段012---Darn it! Now,I don't know who to get to the next verse.

"很悠闲呀012---"greatest of ease...
BAH-bah-bha-bhannn012---BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."

对了  对了  是电子琴012---Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
高中只是玩玩  到大学时就完全地沉迷其中了012---Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college.
我是说  我那是真的找到属于我的声音012---I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
我把果汁喷出来了  但是值得012---Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我已完全忘记你的那种"声音"了  是啊012---I completely forgot about your sound. Yeah.

怎么了  我们在专属车道上抛锚了012---What happened? We broke down on the Parkway,
我得走回去找一些变速液012---so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid.
听着  请告诉凯西  抱歉  我会尽快赶回来的012---And listen，you please tell Kathy that I'am sorry I'll be there as soon as I can.
你怎么不自己说  因为我只有一刻钟  而且我想投币时间快要...012---Why can't you tell her? 'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to--

却发现变速器不见了012---the transmission wasn't there!
什么  可能是在前几个路口就掉了012---What? Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back.

我决定照做012---I'm gonna do that.
是不是打算和凯希012---You mean with Casey.
不  不  不  我想继续跟凯西交往下去  她很酷012---No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
或者凯希  不  不  凯西012---Or Casey. No-no, Kathy.
凯希也行012---Could be Casey.
不  不  凯西012---No-no, Kathy.
考虑一下凯希012---Consider Casey.
你知道我怎么想么  看来有人喜欢凯希了012---Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey.
要不要我撮合你们俩呢  你怎么想012---How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
那我的生活终于可以踏入正轨了012---That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你太棒了  你真的  真的很棒012---You were really great! You were really, really great!
谢谢  谢谢012---Oh, thanks, thanks.
摩妮卡说你以后都不再想演奏了012---So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore
因为我...和我的才华012---because me....and y'know my talent.
是真的吗012---Is that true?
哦  大概吧  是的  菲比012---Well, kind of, yeah. Pheebs...
是的  但我无法  我很想保持乐观无所谓的态度012---Yeah, I-I can't --I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it...
但是在你的才华面前  我自惭形秽012---...I just -- I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
但是…012---See, but...
菲比  这和我演奏的初衷完全相反了012---Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
你知道  我的音乐是要鼓舞人心的012---Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire,
如果这样反而挫伤了你012---If it bothers you this much...
那我以后  就不再演奏了012---...then I won't play anymore.
不  不  不  千万不要012---Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that!
如果离开你的音乐  我怎么能活得下去呢012---How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
嘿  钱德  看到新家具了  非常漂亮012---Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
乔伊有你这个男朋友真好012---Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
我吻了凯西012---I kissed Kathy.
什么  你是说真的012---What? Are you serious?
乔伊知道吗  不知道012---Does Joey know? No.
你们认为有没有可能  他能谅解吗012---Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
你显然还没有深入了解你的室友012---You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends.
这正是让我们都敬佩不已的012---Which we all appreciate.
不  最可悲的是  如果你在亲她之前告诉乔伊你的感受012---No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her,...
乔伊肯定会把她让给你的012---...knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
别  不要告诉我  不要告诉我  那是真的012---Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
我想可能  是真的  他爱你012---I think maybe, yeah. He loves you.
那你们怎么不告诉我012---Then why didn't you tell me to do that?
我跟菲比聊过012---Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
对  我觉得这是个好主意012---Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
我就知道  我还记得  我也记得你告诉过我012---I know, I remember that! I remember you did.
天哪  我该怎么办012---God!! What am I gonna do?!
钱德  你得告诉他012---Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
为什么  为什么非得告诉他012---Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
因为你必须这么做  是的  我知道012---Because you do. Yeah, I know.
我为此写首曲子  能不能让你好过点012---Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
要不要"茴香玛格丽特"鸡尾酒012---Sambuca Margarita?
那是什么东西012---It that a real thing?
哦   我们只剩茴香味力娇酒   所以就有“茴香玛格丽特”鸡尾酒了012---Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.
听着  乔伊012---Listen, Joe.
我必须  必须要跟你谈谈了012---I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
什么事012---What's up?
是凯西的事012---It's-it's about Kathy.
我喜欢她012---I like her.
事实上  我非常喜欢她012---I like her a lot, actually.
真的么012---You do? Yeah.
那你现在的时机正好012---Well, you're timing couldn't be better.
她现在不是我的女朋友了012---She's not my girlfriend anymore.
什么012---What?
哦  她跟我分手了012---Yeah, she broke up with me.
什么时候的事012---Oh uh, when?
就刚才  表演课后012---Just now, after acting class.
开始我以为她只是在表演某个场景  我还叫大家来看012---At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
哦  太可惜了  你还好吗012---Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
不太好  但我现在没事了  你喜欢她012---Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
对  但是我可以算了012---Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
不  不  我没事的012---No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
真的  对012---Yeah? Yeah.
你知道为什么  因为你先来告诉我012---You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
我就知道这么干没错012---Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
但是  你听着  恐怕你还得努把力012---But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you.
我跟她谈的时候  觉得她好像喜欢另一个人  所以..012---'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
你知道么  这正是我想跟你谈的事情012---See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
我想  我知道那个人是谁012---I-I think I know who the other guy is.
是谁012---Who?
是我012---It's me.
我就是那个别人012---I'm the other guy.
什么012---What?
是的  昨晚你回来迟了  凯西和我聊了起来012---Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, ...
事情演变到后来就…012---...and one thing to another and...
就什么  你跟她上床了012---And what? Did you sleep with her?
没有  没有  我只是吻了她012---No! No! No! I just kissed her.
什么   那更糟糕012---What? That's even worse.
怎么会更糟  我不知道  但那都不行012---How is that worse? I don't know! But it's the same!
听着  我很抱歉  但我没办法  我已经深深爱上了她012---Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
谁管你012---Who cares?
你背着我乱来  我绝不会那样对你012---You went behind my back? I'd never do that to you.
你说得对  我无话可说  我太过份了012---You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
过份  你过份过..过了这么多012---Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line,
甚至看不到线在哪012---that you-you can't even see the line!
你根本就没管那条线012---The line is a dot to you!
没错012---Yes.
没错  我也知道这很糟糕  你要相信我012---Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
所以你买了这么多家具012---Is that why you bought all this stuff!
你知道吗012---Well, y'know what
我不会再看你的电视012---I will not watch your TV.
我不听你的音响012---I won't listen to your stereo.
烤面包机里有一个面包我也不吃  知道为什么012---and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
因为…012---Probably because...
因为它被你的背叛弄脏了012---Because it's all tainted with your betrayal.
从现在起  房子对我来说就是空着的012---From now on this apartment is empty for me!
而且也不会跟你一起玩了012---And I'm not happy about you either.
跟你说一声012---And just so you know...
那个面包是为你烤的012---...I made that bread for you.
天哪  他江郎才尽了  灵气荡然无存了012---Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
什么012---What?
菲比  他的音乐本来就没有可取之处012---Phoebe, his music could not get any worse.
地下室的老鼠听了都去上吊了012---There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
谢谢  谢谢012---Thank you. Thanks.
是的  我才思枯竭了012---Yeah, I lost it.
我不会再演奏了  你愿意012---Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, Would you...
继续演奏下去么012---Can you finish my set?
接着上台  可以012---After that? Yeah!
我是说我愿意尽力012---No, I mean, if I can help.
好像我真的没灵感了似的012---Yeah, like I could lose it.
什么  我是有意弹得佷差012---What? I played bad on purpose guys.
是么  你这段时间一直是故意  弹得这么难听012---Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
呃  不  只是刚刚这最后一首012---Yeah. no, just that last song.
喂012---Hello?
嘿  是我  我知道你不愿意和我一起住了012---Hey, It's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me,
但我还是想在电话里给你道歉  我…012---I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone...All I...
喂012---Hello?
听着  我不该亲你的女朋友  但我…012---Look, I never should've kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
别再打来了012---Stop calling!
嘿  这里是92.3摇滚广播电台012---Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock...
来挑战我们每天的千元大奖吧012---...calling with our $1000 daily challenge.
漂亮012---All right.
请问你室友的名字是什么012---What is the name of...
那个对你非常抱歉  愿意做任何事情012---...your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...?
《老友记》  第四季  第08集  闭关思过012---Friends S04E08  The one with Chandler in a box
啊  火鸡012---Ugh, turkey.
啊  感恩  啊012---Ugh, giving thanks. Ugh.
看  各位  这就是感恩节的精神012---Look, everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving.
你和乔伊好点了吗012---So are things with you and Joey any better?
糟糕透了  昨晚我给他拨了8个小时的电话012---They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night,
想让他和我说说话012---just trying to get him to talk to me.
哇  8小时012---Oh, wow. Eight hours.
你一定用的着那种配在电话上的小耳机012---So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets, huh?
我们都会收到  你从办公室偷来的圣诞礼物吗012---Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
没你的份012---You shouldn't.
说到圣诞节012---Speaking of Christmas...
摩妮卡和我刚开业  没什么钱012---since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money...
今年可以来个秘密的圣诞  我们每人就买一个礼物012---this year maybe we could do Secret Santa and then we each only buy one gift.
这样还多了个神秘感  看谁送给谁012---And-and there's the added mystery of, you know, who gets who.
是谁抽到〝哪个人〞012---Who gets "whom."
我不知道为什么这么做012---I don't know why I do that.
我得睡一会  火鸡让我犯困了012---Oh, I'm gonna take a nap. Turkey makes me sleepy.
我们还没吃那012---We haven't eaten yet.
我知道  但你们一直在准备  那我就…012---I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, and I just...
你们谁打算抽到瑞秋吗  因为我想送她个礼物012---Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, Because I wanna trade for her.
我抽到她  谢天谢地幸好你要她012---I picked her. Oh, thank God, you want her.Ooh!
为什么你这么不想送她礼物012---Wow, why do you wanna get rid of her so badly?
因为她收到什么礼物都拿去换012---Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets,
根本没法送给她她想要的东西012---It's like impossible to get her something she likes.
来吧  咱俩换换012---Come on, let's trade.
不会的  哪有这回事  她很喜欢我送她的那个背包的012---That's not true. That's not true. I got her that backpack and she loved it.
记得有只大狗叼走的时候  她哭的多伤心…012---I remember how much she was crying the day that big dog ran off with it…
根本没有什么大狗012---There was no big dog.
不管这个了  我已经给她买了个皮包  还在上面印上了R.G…012---All right this sucks, because I already got her this briefcase and I had "R.G." put on it.
是她的姓名缩写012---Her initials. Oh.
也许你可以送给别人  像罗斯盖勒  一样的缩写012---Maybe you can give it to somebody else. Oh. Like Ross Geller.
但那是个女用公事包012---Oh, you know what, though? It's a girlie briefcase.
那又怎样  他在博物馆上班012---Who cares? He works in a museum.
嘿  几点了  球赛要开始了012---Hey, what time is it? The big game's about to start.
罗斯和乔伊又不在  没必要这样  愿意的话就看游行呗012---You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here. watch the parade if you want.
谢了012---Thanks.
这个冷冻室出什么毛病了  嗷  嗷012---What is wrong with this freezer? Ow! Ow!
怎么了  天啊  冰渣进我眼睛了012---God, what happened? Oh, my God, ice just got in my eye.
有人还想在这儿睡觉012---People are trying to sleep in here.
摩妮卡的眼睛进冰渣了  很疼012---Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.
睁开  让我看看  不行  太疼了012---Open it up. Let me see. Oh, I can't. It really kills.
或许应该冰敷012---Well, maybe you should put some ice on it.
好像很严重  也许该送你去看医生012---Ooh, it looks bad. Honey, Maybe we should take you to a doctor.
不行  我的眼科医生是理查012---No, my eye doctor is Richard.
没有男朋友我不能去见他的012---I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend.
他对病人的确够挑剔的012---He's really picky about his patients.
你非去不可  他诊所电话号码是多少012---Okay, you've gotta go. What's his office number?
我哪会记得012---Oh, like I remember his office number.
试试快捷键7012---Speed dial 7.
嗨  我是代表摩妮卡盖勒的眼睛在说话012---Hi, yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and...
理查柏克今天在上班吗012---Is Richard Burke in today?
他出城了   她愿意见其他随叫随到的医生么012---He's out of town. but does she wanna see the on-call doctor?
愿意  愿意  她非常兴奋012---Yes. Yes. She's very excited about that.
太酷了012---This is so cool.
摩妮卡回来之前  我是主厨  所有决定都由我来做012---Till Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
嘿  嘿  我想她跟你说了  让你按照食谱来012---Hey, hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly.
滚出我的厨房012---Okay, get out of my kitchen.
好  我想我跟乔伊之间有进展了012---All right, okay. I think I'm making some progress with Joey.
我进房的时候  他直接回他的卧室012---When I went into the apartment, he went straight into his bedroom...
他只摔了一下门012---...but he only slammed the door once!
不过摔门的时候  对我比了中指012---I mean, yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
好吧  我得打电话问问我妈左撇子做菜的问题012---All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left-handed cooking question.
听着  我抽到送摩妮卡礼物012---So listen, I picked Monica for Secret Santa...
但我光明节送过她了012---...but I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.
你想和我换换012---I was wondering if you wanna switch.
知道么  我是想要送给你012---Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
真的  有意思  打算送我什么012---Really?! Wow! That's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
不晓得  R.G  办公室里用的女式用品012---I don't know, R.G. I was thinking something girlie for your office.
也许菲比愿意跟我换012---Yeah. Well, maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
最好不要  那你会抽到瑞秋  她什么礼物都会拿去换012---Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that,Then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel, and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
不可能  我送她很多东西她都留着的012---Oh, that's not true. I got her lots of stuff she never took back.
比如012---Like?
比如像我去年送的金项链012---Like that gold necklace I got her last year.
你最后一次看到她带着是什么时候012---When was the last time you saw her wear it?
她整个圣诞都带着  然后…012---Well, she wore it all Christmas day and then, uh...
大狗012---Big dog?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
把钱德内疚买的东西全部退回去012---Sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
全部  包括电视  不  电视要搬进我房里012---Everything? Even the TV? No, I'm put that in my room.
听着  乔伊  我知道他做错了012---Listen, Joey. I know what he did was wrong.
但你就不能听他解释吗012---But don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
你和瑞秋在一起时012---Back when you and Rachel were together...
要是钱德吻了她  你会听他解释吗012---...if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
说得好012---That's a good point.
那你要惩罚他多久012---So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
五年012---Five years.
你在判他刑012---You've sentenced him?
嘿  若要人不知  除非己莫为012---Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
但是乔伊  他可是你最好的朋友  不  那是以前012---But, Joey, the guy's your best friend. No, was my best friend.
你干嘛拼命替他说情012---Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard.
少了他  我"最要好的朋友"就空出来了012---With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
谁  我吗  对012---Who, me? Yeah.
当然  真荣幸012---Wow. I'm honored.
那么作为你最好的朋友  我该做的第一件事就是012---And you know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
我得让你去跟钱德说话012---I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
好啦012---All right.
除非你是我最好的朋友…012---Oh, but if you weren't my best friend...
天哪  真的那么严重012---Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?
我进了门  他根本不理我012---I walk in the room, and he won't even talk to me.
他只是用意大利语在那儿嘟囔012---He just mumbles something in Italian.
我知道他只会那些骂人的词儿012---And I know he only knows the bad words.
阿甘  有没有看到钱德012---Hey, Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
我以为你才是钱德012---I thought you were Chandler.
你们其中一个在那边012---But, um, one of you is over there.
嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joe.
请稍等一下  好吗012---I'll be right with you, okay?
谢谢你012---Thanks
天哪  这个代诊医生真帅012---Oh, my God. How cute is the on-call doctor?
够帅啊  帅到我想拿笔插我的眼睛012---Oh. So cute that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
柏克医生在等你012---Dr. Burke will see you now.
不  不   柏克医生不在  出城去了012---Oh, no, no, no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke's out of town.
现在我要看的是另一个医生012---The on-call doctor will see me now.
理查柏克医生不在012---Dr. Richard Burke is out of town.
他儿子提摩西柏克医生帮你看012---Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
准备好了吗012---Ready?
对不起  刚才…012---Hey, I'm sorry. That...
你要去哪里  我爸妈家012---Where you going? My folks'.
什么时候回来012---Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
不知道012---I don't know.
待一段时间  顺便再去找个新房子住012---I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
什么012---What?
原先我以为我们可以谈开来  然后和好012---Yeah, you know, at first I thought we could talk about this, work it out.
但一看到你俩在一起  我就……012---but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I…
那你想让我说什么  说我不去见她了吗012---Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say I'll stop seeing her?
跟她无关  好吗012---Look, It's not about her. Okay?
一看到你俩  就让我想起你的所作所为012---But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did.
我不跟一个不懂朋友道义的人  住在一起012---And I don't wanna live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.
我告辞了  我懂朋友道义012---So I'll see you. Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend.
我只是  只是搞砸了  对  没错012---I just-I just screwed up! Yeah, you did.
所以我要搬走012---And that's why I'm leaving.
听着  你不为我留下来  至少要为它们留下来012---All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them.
它们这一年很不顺  还有那次抢劫012---Okay? They have had a very difficult year, what with the robbery and all.
那个家伙在抢我们东西的时候012---When that guy was robbing us...
我在柜子里被关了六小时012---...and I was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours...
你知道我当时在干嘛吗012---do you know what I was doing in there all that time?
我是在想  我多么的对不起你012---I was thinking about how I let you down.
对012---Wow. Yeah.
早知道你会见色忘友  我根本不会那样做012---Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much!
再见012---See you around.
等一下   再给我个机会012---Just wait one second. There has to be something that I can do.Something!
要是还有那个柜子012---If we still had that entertainment unit...
我宁愿在里面待上6个小时  检讨我是怎样的对不起你012---...I would get in there for six hours and think about how I let you down.
怎么了012---What?
这儿有个箱子012---We got a box.
我记得上次见到你012---I remember the last time I saw you.
是我离家去学校的那天早上012---It was the morning I left for college.
你站在乳品皇后店外面012---And You were just standing outside the Dairy Queen.
可能是在等它开门012---Heh. Just probably waiting for it to open.
我得说  你现在好漂亮012---I gotta tell you, you look great now.
你也很帅  你真是个与众不同的病人012---You look great too. You're an excellent patient.
伤痕明显么012---So how does it look?
角膜上还有点伤  你得带个眼罩保护两三天012---You've got a little scratch on your cornea. You're gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
像海盗那样012---Like a pirate?
大致是那样012---If that helps you.
你跟你爸一起工作多久了012---Ahem. So how long have you been working with your dad?
别这样  咱俩总有一个要提起他012---Come on, one of us had to mention him.
两个月前搬回来的012---I moved back here a couple months ago.
晚上有个家庭聚餐吧012---Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
不是吧012---No way.
我本来打算在女朋友家过感恩节的012---I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
但我们分手了012---Oh. But we broke up.
她对恋爱本身态度并不严肃012---She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
所以你把她从甲板上弄下去了  是吧  水手012---Oh. So you made her walk the plank, aye, matey?
你还没带上眼罩呢012---You're not wearing the patch yet.
我知道012---I know.
他要来我们这儿过感恩节  对啊  好变态啊012---He's coming here for Thanksgiving? I know. It's sick.
为什么变态  因为他是理查的儿子012---Why is it sick? Because it's Richard's son.
简直是把希腊悲剧故事邀请来了012---It's like inviting a Greek tragedy over for dinner.
菲比  你理解我  对吧012---Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand, don't you?
可以说是  但做为你好友就得说  不012---Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no.
对不起  但我认为你把事情弄乱了012---I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
什么事儿乱了  我跟理查的儿子约会012---What's twisted? Oh. Me going out with Richard's son.
好嗯012---Ewwwww!!
嗯 嗯 嗯012---Ew, ew, ew.
听起来是不怎么样012---Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
他在里面没事儿吧012---Is he okay in there?
他很好012---He's fine.
要是你跟理查的儿子真的成了012---Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, ...
你就能对你们的孩子说  你和他们的祖父上过床012---...you'll be able to tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather.
好  随你们怎么批评  不过012---Fine! Judge all you want to but,
和女同性恋结婚  临阵逃婚  迷上滑冰舞的同性恋012---married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer...
把女生的木腿丢进火里  住在箱子里012---...threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire, live in a box.
那么  这个箱子是什么用意012---So, now, ahem, what exactly is the point of the box?
钱德012---Chandler?
箱子的用意有三点012---The meaning of the box is three fold.
一是  让我有时间好好反思我的所作所为012---One, it gives me the time to think about what I did.
二是  说明我是多么在乎跟乔伊的友谊012---Two, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey.
三是012---And three
会痛012---it hurts.
嘿  喔012---Oh, hey, hey, uh... Hmm?
还记得我去年送你的项链吗012---you remember the necklace I gave you last year?
能给我看看么012---Can I see it?
为什么012---Why?
只是想看看而已012---I just wanna check something.
好012---Okay.
等着瞧吧012---Now we'll see.
没气了  没气了012---Air hole! Air hole!
在这里  我很喜欢  整天带着012---Here it is. I love it. I wear it all the time.
我送你的是金项链  这个是银的012---The necklace I got you was gold. this is silver.
也许它012---Huh. Well, maybe, it, uh
变色了012---it changed.
天哪  你真的把它给换了012---Oh, my God. You actually exchanged it.
换一个我喜欢又常用的东西012---Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
这样不好吗012---and that I can get a lot of use out of?
你换了什么012---What did you get?
存款012---Credit.
我来开  我来开  我来开012---I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
嗨  提姆  嗨012---Hi, Tim. Hi.
嗨  谢谢  来见见我的朋友012---Hi. Thank you. Come meet my friends.
这是菲比  幸会012---This is Phoebe. Hi, nice to meet you.
乔伊  你好012---And Joey. Hey.
乔伊  我哥哥罗斯012---Joey. My brother, Ross.
你好  还有瑞秋012---Hey. And Rachel.
你好012---Hi. Ahem.
那是钱德  你好012---That's Chandler. How do you do?
这是  他在012---What's...? Um, well, he's, um...
他在反省012---He's doing some thinking.
他得分了012---He's got it.
耶  耶012---Yes! Yeah!
怎么了  怎么了  你亲了我的女友012---What happened? What happened?! You kissed my girlfriend.
喔  我喜欢那些太阳镜012---Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
"真的喜欢"  还是喜欢它们012---"Like them" like them...
还是喜欢它们带来的存款012---...or "I'd like to get store credit for that amount" like them?
好了各位  火鸡上桌了012---All right, everybody. This turkey is ready.
在哪洗手  这里012---Where can I wash up? Here.
我带你去012---Let me show you.
毛巾在水池旁边  你能用那块高级香皂012---Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
谢谢012---Thank you.
高级香皂  我还以为是为教皇准备的012---Fancy soap? I thought we were saving that for the Pope.
他不错  是吧012---See? He's nice, right?
是的  不过莫妮卡  你是否想过发展下去  就能这么说了012---Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase,
"你父亲以前可不这么做"012---"That's not how your dad used to do it"?
哇  真丰盛  我坐哪儿012---Wow, everything looks great. Where should I sit?
我帮你留了个位子012---Saved you a seat.
变态-变态-变态-变态012---Sick-sick-sick-sick.
我来开门012---Oh, I'll get it.
被我骗了012---Gotcha.
这听起来不像是在为我反思012---That doesn't sound like thinking to me.
对不起  我可不认为你应该说话012---Sorry. Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there!
要反思那么多事情  应该没空说话和开玩笑的012---I think you got too much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes.
好  好  遵命012---Okay, okay, you got it.
罗斯  递给我红薯  好么012---Ross, could you pass me the yams? Sure.
你想换的话  乔伊那里还有土豆泥012---Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
够了  你到底怎么了012---Will you stop? What is the matter with you?
有客人喔012---Oh-ho-ho, We've got company.
我没什么事儿012---There's nothing the matter with me.
可我不缺乏情感012---See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
我有感受的012---See, I have feelings.
好  很好012---Okay, fine.
你们都哑巴了吧  我来缓解一下气氛012---You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys.
好  听着012---All right, look.
如果你把它当成笑话  那就算了  好吗012---If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?
这对我不是玩笑012---This means something to me.
你要是觉得无所谓  那你马上走012---And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there.
除非你是个愿意呆在箱子里的傻瓜012---Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.
你说的对  我错了  这事对我很重要012---You're right. I'm sorry. This means a lot to me.
我要让你重新成为我的朋友  我发誓  今晚不再说一个字了012---I want you to be my friend again. I swear I won't say another word tonight.
你真的会当回事  绝对会012---So you're gonna take this thing seriously? Absolutely.
又说话了012---That sounds like another word to me.
你真的会当一回事吗012---Are you gonna take this seriously?
很好012---Okay.
不要说我没有情感啊012---Don't say that I have no sentiment.
这是第一次  我们约会的电影票根012---This is a movie stub from our first date.
这是第一次  你为我做床上早点的蛋壳012---This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed.
这是从博物馆的拿  我们第一次…012---This is from the museum, the first time we...
在一起的时候012---...were together.
对  也许我是常把礼物换掉  但有意义的东西我会留012---Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter.
我不知道该说什么好  对不起012---I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.
不过012---Though
你不该把这个拿走012---you're not supposed to take these.
它有差不多百万年的历史012---It's like a million years old.
事实上  我们还派专人去找过的012---we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
老是会卡住012---Oh, this always happens.
让我来012---Here, let me, um...
谢谢012---Thank you.
你有非常漂亮的012---You-you have a very beautiful
眼睛012---eye.
所有的朋友都认为这事儿很怪012---Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
我原先也觉得会  还差点打电话取消  但事实上不会012---Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
我的意思是咱们现在  我与你父亲的过去  完全是两码子事情012---I know. I mean, it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
完全同意012---Oh, I totally agree.
我是说  我们只是两个012---we're just two people who find each other
互相吸引的人012---very attractive.
对吧012---Right?
怎么了  没事  没事012---What? Nothing, nothing.
真的  吻的不好012---No, no, really. Oh, was-was that not okay?
不  很好012---No, no, no, that was good.
那是个  呃  甜蜜的吻012---That was, uh... That was a good kiss.
天啊  这不会让你想起  别说了012---Oh, my God. It didn't remind you of my...? Oh, don't say it.
但是有  对吧  对012---No, but it did! Didn't it?! Yes!
欧  天哪012---Oh, man.
我知道012---I know.
我去开012---I got it.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
听着  我真的很抱歉   没关系012---Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am... It's okay.
没事儿  我气的是钱德012---That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at. so...
我还是很抱歉012---Well, I'm so sorry.
他在吗  在箱子里012---Is he here? In the box.
钱德012---Chandler?
他现在不能说话012---Oh, he can't talk right now.
为什么  怎么了012---Why not? What's going on?
他在向乔伊证明他是多么在乎他012---He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
所以窝在箱子里  乔伊有他的理由012---By being in a box? Joey had reasons.
有三个理由012---They were threefold.
啊  哦  好吧012---Oh. Well, uh...
你不能讲话  这样倒也好012---you not being able to talk may make this easier.
听我说…012---Listen, um
听我说012---Listen.
我不想介入两个最要好的朋友之间012---I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends.
我真不忍心看到会发生在你们身上的事情012---I just... I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys.
也不想是因为我  所以012---And I don't wanna be the cause of that.So
我想我们还是不要见面了012---I don't think we can see each other anymore.
我要去芝加哥找我妈012---I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago.
我会住一阵子012---I'm gonna stay there for a while.
这么做或许让人感到惊讶012---I think this could have been something really amazing.
但你知道  或许这么做最好012---But, you know, this is probably for the best.
你懂吗012---You know?
我会想念你的012---I'm gonna miss you.
再见了  钱德012---Goodbye, Chandler.
把箱子打开012---Open the box.
什么  他还能追上她012---What? He can still catch her.
出来  出来  出来012---Hey, come on. Get out of there. Get out of there.

谁抽到钱德了  我要换012---All right, who got Chandler? Because I need to trade.
他看到她了012---Oh, he sees her.
他在追她012---Aw, and he's catching up to her.
她看到他了012---Oh, she sees him.
他们拥抱了012---Oh, they're hugging. Aw.
他在拿她的钱包012---He's taking her purse.
不是他们  我去报警012---Uh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
喔  他们在那里  哪里012---Oh, there they are. Where?
好  快去开房吧012---All right, get a room.
好的  过来  别偷看012---Okay. Come on, no peeking.
我们闭上眼睛了  然后穿过大街  太好了012---Our eyes are closed, and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
好  可以睁开了012---Okay. Open up.
你要让我们看什么  因为我们看到的只有辆棒极了的货车012---What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchen van.
这是我们备办伙食用的012---Yeah, it's for our catering business.
我想我见过那女孩012---Oh. I think I know that girl.

虽然我对此并不十分信服012---Although, uh, I might need some convincing.

我认为您这里提到的文件归档系统非常棒012---I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
谢谢012---Thank you.
文件归档系统  就是你弄在文件夹上那些彩色标签012---Filing system? Oh, you mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
那倒是的确给档案柜增色不少012---It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
标签的作用不止于此012---Well, they, uh... they-they did more than that.
我看到你肩负了许多重要职责012---I notice that you've been entrusted with a lot of important responsibilities.
对  乔安娜确实对我有知遇之恩012---Yes. Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
瑞秋每天早上给我送百吉饼  做得也非常不错012---Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible at getting my morning bagel.
不可思议  她几乎每次都不会买错012---It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time.
我  我  我当然  还有其他更多的职责012---I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
没错  还有咖啡也是  瑞秋一次能拎两样东西012---Oh, yes, of course. There's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once.
相当优秀012---That's, uh, very good.
现在这个工作的很大一部分012---Now a uh, a big part of this job...
是建立同他人的关系  特别是和设计师012---...is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
对  我意识到… 这点瑞秋没问题012---Yes, Yes, I realize that... Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that.
唯一的问题就是怕她打得太火热  如果你们知道我说的012---Her only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
我最喜欢和设计师共事了012---I love working with designers.
共事或共枕  又有什么差别呢  瑞秋012---With them, under them, what's the difference, eh, Rach?
我第一篇美食评论上报了  哦  《切尔西报道》012---Hey. My first review is out. Oh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh,
以前我都拿它来盖在身上御寒012---Ah. These used to keep me so warm.
快看  我的评论在反面012---All right, look at my on the back page. Ooh. Oh!
好   "我还会再去光顾亚历山卓吗  当然  但我会点两份餐012---Okay. "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I would have to order two meals.
一份给我   一份给那个用枪指着我的头逼我再到这个餐厅的人"012---One for me, and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."
哇  你真把这家店批得一文不值012---Wow, you really laid into this place.
报社付我钱  又不是要我广结朋友012---Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
我得走了  我找到一个人  他可以修咱们外面的货车012---Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy who could fix up the van for catering.
要不要我跟你一块去  不用  没事012---Oh. Do you need me to go with you? No, no, it's okay.
但你确定我们不要那张水床了么012---But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
我们不是早就说好了  对啦012---Haven't we made this decision? Yeah.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
谁啊012---Who is it?
我是亚历山卓餐厅的老板012---It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
我想跟你谈谈你的那篇评论  哦  天啊  天啊012---I wanna talk to you about your review. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
你打电话给我012---Call me on the phone.
为什么  那样你可以随时挂掉电话012---Why? So you could hang up on me?
我不会让你上来的  你还是走吧012---But I'm never gonna let you up, so you may as well just go away.
给我个机会012---Just give me a chance to...
你要进去么  来吧012---Hey, Do you need to get in? Here you go.
菲比  不行啦  嗨  摩妮卡012---No, Phoebe! Oh, hey, Monica.
我要你收回你的评论  我们的食物绝非"难以下咽"012---I want a retraction. Our food is not "inedible swill."
我就吃不下去012---I couldn't eat it.
我那五个朋友也难以下咽  虽然他们中的一个连书都能吃012---I have five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
那么  至少我们的服务  也不是"宾至如衰"012---Well, our service is not "grossly incompetent."
你们的服务员把面包棒塞在裤子里012---The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants.
你还写  我们店里接受发现卡012---Well, you said that we accept the Discover Card
其实不行012---which we do not.
好啊  那句话我可以收回012---All right, that I'll retract.
但我坚持我的观点  我懂美食  但决不是你们那样012---But I stand by my review. I know food, and that wasn't it.
你们的意式沙拉  尝起来就像是番茄汁012---Your marinara sauce tastes like tomato juice.
你们应该加些伏特加酒与芹菜末012---You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
我以店里那果汁为荣  很美味012---Hey, I'm proud of that sauce. It's delicious.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你是开意大利餐厅的  竟然认为那样很美味012---You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?
你从哪来的012---Where are you even from?
黎巴嫩012---Lebanon.
把那些蕃茄递给我012---Hand me those tomatoes.
我来示范纯正的味道是怎样来的  给我012---I'm gonna show you what it should taste like. Come on.
你要弄多久啊  我还要去骂另一个美食评论家012---How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic I gotta go yell at.
乔安娜  我想跟你谈谈面试的事012---Ahem. Uh, Joanna, I wanna talk about that interview.
我觉得你的面试不错啊012---I thought it went very well.
不  它很差  我就是要跟你说这件事012---No, it didn't. That's what I wanna talk to you about.
现在  简单点说012---Now, just to brief you
我可能会哭出来012---I may cry.
并不是因为伤心和生气012---But they are not tears of sadness or of anger
而是因为我要你跟讨论这件事012---but just of me having this discussion with you.
瑞秋  请不要这样012---Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
这里又没人012---There's nobody here.
苏菲  你进来012---Sophie, get in here.
看吧  你让苏菲尴尬了012---You see? Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable.
我没有尴尬啊012---She's not making me uncomfortable.
恭喜  你总算有点作用了  出去012---Congratulations, You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
你是要我辞职吗012---Do you want me to quit?
什么  你怎么会这样想012---What? What would make you think that?
因为那些你在面试时说的话012---Well, all of those things you said in the interview.
如果里面有你的真心话  那我一定不是个好助理012---I mean If you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant.
不如这样吧012---You know what?
我收拾下办公桌012---I am just going to pack up my desk
今天下班后就走人012---and I will be gone by the end of the day.
我想没必要耗到今天下班了012---Well, I guess there's no use me sticking around till the end of the day.
你等等…012---Wait, wait, wait.
把那可怜的小松糕放回抽屉里012---You can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer.
如果你要听实话的话  我不想失去你这完美的助理012---If you must know the truth, I didn't wanna lose a perfectly good assistant.
什么012---What?
所以我才瞎掰出你轻浮和酗酒的事012---That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking.
我酗酒012---My drinking?
那我一定是在你离开后说的012---Oh. I must have said that after you left.
你到底说了什么012---Said what, exactly?
你时不时喜欢酗酒...012---That you enjoyed the occasional drink...
酒后乱性012---...ing binge.
天啊  够了  我得离开这012---Oh, my God. Oh. That is it. I'm leaving.
你太可怕了  不要  等等012---You are just a horrible person. No, wait, wait, wait.
如果你真的在意这个职位的话012---Now, if you're gonna get all sensitive about it.
我真不想失去你012---I don't want to lose you.
不如  我给你创造这么个职位怎样012---What if I create a position for you?
我让你在这部门里  担任采购助理012---I'll make you assistant buyer in this department.
再多说一点012---Say more things like that. Um...
你有自己独立的办公室  外带加薪  明天就生效012---You can have your own office and a raise, effective tomorrow.
我需要公费报销  没问题012---I'd need an expense account. Done.
还要有助理  苏菲  进来012---And an assistant. Sophie, get in here.
嘿  你们怎么在这里012---Hey, what are you guys doing here?
我以为你们和甘到夫狂欢了012---I thought you'd be partying with Gandoldorf.
是甘道夫  他不来了012---It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.
那你们一早都呆坐在这里  没有012---So you've been sitting here all morning? No.
我刚刚把帐算好了012---I balanced my checkbook.
对  我给所有的足球桌里的小人都起了名字012---Yeah, and I gave first names to all the foosball players.
不敢相信甘道夫竟然没来012---I can't believe he didn't come.
他不来又怎样  我们还是可以自己出去狂欢啊012---So what if he didn't come? We can still go out and party ourselves.
哦  不  有甘道夫在  我们一整晚都有的玩的012---Oh, no, you know, with Gandalf, we'd be out all night.
而且还能和一堆陌生人一起混  跟他们待在外面不回来012---Yeah, we'd meet total strangers and hang out with them.
我们也可以啊012---Well, we can do that.
他还有其他的绝招012---There was other stuff too.
我们都会啊  而且更好012---We'll do it all, and better.
瞧着吧  今晚过后  就换我们带甘道夫去狂欢  兄弟们012---Look, after tonight, Gandalf will wanna party with us, dude.
来吧012---Come on.
对  对012---Yeah. Yeah.
好像我们不会狂欢似的  好了么  我们走012---It's not like we don't know how to party. Yeah. All right. Let's go.
最后再到一次船上如何012---And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
好耶012---Yeah! All right!
哈012---Ah!

摩妮卡  问你个小问题  采购助理穿这套装如何012---Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
亚历山卓的老板上门来吼我012---Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me,
但我趁机做了些沙拉给他  结果他就雇我当他的首席大厨012---but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你毁了我在回家路上练了好久的好戏  但我真是替你高兴012---You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm so happy.
你相信吗  我终于可以回我心爱的厨房了012---Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen.
噢  你盼了那么久012---Oh, you've waited so long.
嘿  菲比  问你个小问题  好012---Hey. Hey, Pheebs. Quick question for you. yeah.
布鲁明岱尔的采购助理  穿上这套装如何012---How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?

你升职了  是的012---You got the job! Yes!

我想是时候从承包伙食行业退出来了012---well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from the catering.
但我们才做了一笔生意啊012---But we've only had one job.
我知道  但现在有第二笔了  就像雪球一样越滚越大012---I know, but now we have this second one, and it just feels like it's snowballing.

菲比  你等等012---Phoebe, wait a minute.
我升采购助理了012---I'm an assistant buyer!
我们先喝点咖啡  养足精神  再重新出发012---All right, we'll get a little coffee, get energized, then we'll head back out.
好吧  好012---Yeah, all right. Okay.
很好玩嘛  对不对  我们才不需要那个什么"魔法师"的012---So we're having fun, right? We don't need that wizard guy.
我们去了几家俱乐部  跟一些陌生人交谈012---We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers...

送比萨012---Pizza?
摩妮卡012---Monica.
我写了一堆你能运送的东西012---All right, I got a whole bunch of stuff in this area...
但我估计你不是很想作送货外卖的活012---...but I'm getting the feeling you don't wanna deliver.
当然不  那好吧012---No. Okay.
我猜你不想送…012---I'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver...

任命文件之类的东西012---...before it happened?
没有  完全没有012---No, nothing.
只盼当初  她晚个几秒钟过街就没事了012---Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb a few seconds later...
对  差个几秒钟  她就还能跟我们在一起012---Oh. Yes, yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us.
她没说到采购助理的事012---Nothing about an assistant buyer?
真的没有  不好意思  我得走了012---No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
早安012---Good morning.

我的座位靠门  她要换车的话012---and I sat near the door so she'd have to pass by me
就得从我边上过  她拿我没办法012---...if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
你迟到是因为和她神侃吗012---Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
不是  我赶紧回来了  因为她住在Poughkeepsie（纽约州东南部）012---No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
她看上去真的很不错  住在2个半小时的路程之外012---She seems really great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
都住在Poughkeepsie了  怎么还会很棒012---How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.

我的生日  然后又是"嗙"012---...then my birthday, then bang!
在你反应过来之前  又是圣诞节了012---before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again.
噢  我想有人陪012---Ohh, I want somebody!
我要个真正的"男人"012---You know, I want a man!
我是说  哪怕不是正式的交往  而只是"逢场作戏"一次也好012---I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship. y'know, just like a fling would be great.
真的  我还以为女孩子从来不想搞"一夜情"的呢012---Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
我告诉你  我很早以前就来过"一夜情"了012---Let me tell you, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
噢  那我知道圣诞节要送你什么了012---Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
我有几个同事挺不错的  要不要帮你介绍一下012---There are nice guys in my office. Want me to set you up?
好啊012---Yeah.
好啊  等等  我已经单身好久了  你以前为什么不提012---Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
我现在有女朋友了  很快乐012---Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy.
所以  我不再需要把快乐建筑在他人的痛苦之上了012---So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
好012---Okay.
我不要会计师012---No accountants.
也不要律师  我不喜欢工作无聊的男人012---And no one from "legal." I don't like boring jobs.
噢  罗斯工作不无聊吗  他是驯兽师么012---Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
怎么回事  莫妮012---What's wrong, Mon?
餐馆的所有人都恨我012---Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
本来我想我的人缘好起来了012---I thought I was making headway.
大家都冲着我微笑  下班后012---Everyone was smiling at me all day, and then I get off work
才发现他们在我帽子上写了这个012---and find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
也许他们想写的是 "婊子  快住嘴"012---Hey, maybe they meant to write, "Quiet, Bitch."
嘿  亲爱的  怎么了012---Hey, honey! What's the matter?
干嘛  火气这么大012---Fine! Just trying to be nice.
从幼儿园后  我就没被这么捉弄过了012---I haven't been picked on this much since kindergarten.
当时他们找了个国中生 来监视我012---And they brought in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
他们想尽办法赶我走012---I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit,
换做是别的工作  我早就不干了012---and if there were any other job, I would.
但是这是我一生都想从事的职业012---This is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
哦  等等  你是老大012---Well, wait a minute, you're the boss.
为什么不吼他们  或干脆炒了他们012---Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
我也很想这样  可是我做不到  我最不会处理这种冲突012---I would love to, but I can't. you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
嘿  你知道你该怎么办么012---Hey, You know what you can do?
我记得我曾读过一个导演的书  好像是奥森威尔斯 ("公民凯恩"的导演)012---I remember read about this director, I think it was Orson Wells,
他会在电影开拍前  雇一个人012---who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody,
然后当着大伙的面  解雇他012---just so he could fire them in front of everybody.
这样那些人就会明白  谁才是头儿012---Then they would all know who was boss.
嘿  莫妮卡  反正我没事  你干脆开除我算了012---Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
好主意  你知道怎么当服务生吗012---I's a good idea! do you know waiter?
反正你要开除我  管那么多干嘛012---Good enough to get fired.
好  我决定用你了012---All right. You're hired!
嘿012---Hey!
难怪我上个礼拜被开除  奥森威尔斯是不是也掌管汉堡包的生意012---Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
有012---Yes.
我说的是  德  你现在有没有人约会012---I say, Drew? Are you seeing anybody right now?
哦  我不是在帮我自己问012---Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me.
我  我  我不是同性恋  我不是想约你012---I’m… I mean… No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out.
我不是同志012---I'm not gay. Okey!
我从不认为你是同性恋012---I didn't think you were gay.
不过现在拿不准了012---I do now.
我朋友瑞秋  希望我帮她介绍个男人012---See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
我才刚刚跟前女友分手012---Ahh,I just got out of a big relationship.
我现在不想跟谁交往012---I'm not looking for any thing serious.
你知道么  哪怕是“逢场作戏”都行  没问题的012---Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
喔  喔  喔  是不是你曾带到圣诞晚会上的那个 "火辣瑞秋"吗012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this "Hot Rachel" that you took to the Christmas Party? Rachel?
没错  那就是她的全名012---Oh, By the way, that is her full name.
我有空   帮我介绍一下吧012---Wow! I'm free for her.
等等  我又没说我没空012---Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free.
嘿  钱德  我们在明天"游骑兵"队的比赛上谈谈这个事呢012---Hey, Chandler, I'll talk so at the Ranger game tomorrow?
打住  我刚得到一盒古巴雪茄012---Hold on. y'know I just got a box of Cubans.
也许我可以拿到你办公室去  5点钟怎么样012---maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
这个么  我平常不会待到这么晚  不过可以破个例012---that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
也许比赛前012---Maybe, before the game
我们可以去享受两瓶8年陈酿的巴素海顿波本012---we can enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
天晓得那是什么东东  但好吧012---Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!
嘿  你们几个  我为所有人写了个节日歌  你们想听么012---Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
好啊  好012---Yeah! Yes!
摩妮卡  光明节快乐012---Happy Hanukkah, Monica
乔伊  愿你圣诞节瑞雪纷飞012---May your Christmas be snowy, Joey
钱德  罗斯  新年快乐012---Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross
瑞秋  快来转陀螺012---Spin the dreidel, Rachel
菲比  真好听  太棒了012---Pheebs, that's great! Oh, yay!
但是瑞秋跟陀螺不押韵012---But you know, uh, Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
我知道  但是你的垃圾名字实在很难找到压韵的词012---I know, but it's so hard. Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
不会呀  跟瑞秋押韵的字多得很012---What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:
如贝果  信件  监狱  保释金  第四台…012---Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
五月柱…012---Maypole.
那些都不错  谢了012---All good. Thanks.
你有没有比较容易押韵的外号什么的012---Do you maybe have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
你爸以前  不是常叫你小南瓜吗012---Didn't your dad call you "Pumpkin"?
对  没错012---Oh, yeah.
Pumpkin  好吧  但他有没有叫过你布道夫012---Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you "Budolph"?
大家好  嘿012---Hello, children. Hey.
我帮你找了50个候选男人012---Have I got the 50 guys for you!
真的么  我不过把你的照片亮给他们看012---Really? Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and
他们就全都蜂拥而上012---guys were throwing themselves at me!
他们又是请我喝酒  又是送我东西012---They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff!
今晚看球赛  当然  座位在哪儿012---Knicks tonight? Sure! Where are the seats?
随你挑  我有20张票012---Wherever! I've got 20.
那么  他们中有没有适合我的012---So, will I like any of these guys?
你知道的  我想再多…012---You know, I'm going to, uh...
观察阵子  钱德012---...play the field a little bit more. Chandler...
他们甚至把401-k（养老基金）受益人都填成我啦012---Guys are signing over their 401 Ks to me.
你的同事都是机器人(不要养老金)啊012---You work with robots?
你说的对012---Yes.
其中有个叫派崔克的小伙  我想你应该会喜欢他012---Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him,
他人好  风趣  还是个游泳健将012---He's really nice, funny and a swimmer.
我爱死游泳健将的身材了012---I like swimmers' bodies.
而且他老爸还发明了  信用卡背面的识别磁条012---Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
我也爱死信用卡了012---Op, I like credit cards!
你看  这事我办得不错吧012---See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
他是做什么工作的  他在精炼食品部门工作012---Well, so what does he do? Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
你公司还做精炼食品  这可是家大公司  如果你  我012---You have a fine foods division? It's a big company,I don't—if you—I…
等等  又做精炼食品又做机器人012---Now, wait a second. You make food and robots?
不是啦  机器人是帮忙工作的012---No, the robots just work for them.
好了  我得上班去了012---All right, I'm going to work.
有人有意见吗012---Does anybody have a problem with that?
是的  小姐  我有意见012---Yeah, lady. I do!
我就是有意见012---I got a problem with that!
你有意见  就别怪我不客气了012---You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
你想怎样  开除我012---Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
你个蠢驴  我解雇你了012---You bet your ass I'll fire you!
回头见  谢谢012---See you later. Thank you.
噢  喔  我得走了  今晚有约会012---Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
是么  跟谁012---Oh yeah! With who?
还记得那个住在  波放浦夕的女孩吗  记得012---You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? Yeah.
不是她012---Not her.
我又认识了一个女孩012---Yeah, this is someone else,
现在左右为难012---and I-I can’t decide between the two of them.
波敔浦夕那个女孩  虽然得坐2小时火车才能看到她  但漂亮012---The one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty...
聪明又有趣012---...really smart and a lot of fun.
但另一个女孩  就住在上城区012---But this other girl, well，she lives right uptown.
她也很漂亮012---Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty,
可能也聪明012---I guess she's smart.
但是一点也不风趣012---She's not fun.
一点也不风趣  你为什么还要跟她约会012---she's no fun, why date her at all?
我想再给她一个机会  对吧  她住的这么近012---Well, I-I want to give her a chance. y'know? She lives so close.
而且上次约会的最后  另一次  她曾说了些...012---And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that...
如果是在开玩笑的话  那她就佷风趣012---if she was kidding, was very funny.
否则她不仅无聊  而且愚蠢  还有种族歧视012---On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun. She's stupid and kind of a racist.
嘿  嘿  伙计012---Hey. Hey. Hey, man!
第一天在餐厅工作  情况如何012---Hey! Ooh, How was your first day working at the restaurant?
可恶012---Damn!
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你的制服怎么了012---What happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
被他们烤了012---They baked it.
我再也受不了了012---I can't take this anymore.
今晚要开个会  然后解雇你  没问题012---I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.You got it. Oh, oh!
你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
你衣服上还有火星012---It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
谢谢  你应该已经拍灭了吧012---Thanks. I think you got it!
钱德  你对男人的品味一流012---Chandler, you have the best taste in men.
有其父必有其子012---Well, Like father, like son.
派崔克和我昨晚玩得好开心012---Patrick and I had such a great time last night!
说不定能发展出一段  认真的感情012---I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
是么  好像不是想要跟谁交往的呀  你只想“放荡”一下012---Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
噢  好像是这样012---Well, you know, possibly.
你没告诉他吧012---You didn't tell him that, though, right?
没有  我已经说了012---Ummmmmmmm, no.
你告诉他我只是想搞"一夜情"012---You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?
你怎么能告诉他012---You don't tell the guy that!
为什么不行  如果我知道那个火辣的女孩想要  我会兴奋得发抖…012---Why not?I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get
噢  我明白了012---I see.
你告诉他我想“一夜情”012---Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling
而我想跟他长期交往012---and me putting out on the first date
他一定会误会的012---oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
乔伊  把芝士递过来么012---Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
好的  我想你还是别叫我乔伊012---Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.
因为这没人认识我  所以我想帮自己取了个超炫的外号012---Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
嘿  龙哥012---Hey, Dragon!
这是你周一和周二2天赚的小费012---Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
天啊  有三百块耶012---There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
过节时客人总是特别大方012---Yeah, People get generous around the holidays.
穿紧身裤的效果更是很棒012---And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
请服务生集合一下  交代一下今晚的特价菜012---Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?
首先是用芒果佐味的智利黑鲈012---Okay, first there's Chilean sea bass with a mango relish on a bag
你们为什么没人用笔记一下012---Why is nobody writing these down?
因为我们能记住012---We can remember them.
因为你们这样就能象以前一样随口捏造假的特价菜  然后让我来弄012---Because you'll make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
哦  没错  也有这个原因012---Well, Sure, that too.
好吧  先把特价菜放到一边  是这样的…012---Okay, Forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing...
过去两周里  我试着想012---For the last two weeks I have, uh...
努力营造一个愉快的工作环境012---...tried hard to create a positive atmosphere.
听不到012---Can't hear you!
愉快的工作环境012---positive atmosphere!
但是现在我对此不抱希望了012---But I've had it up to here.
从现在开始  要么按我说得去做012---From now on, it is going to be my way
要么就滚蛋012---...or the highway. All right?
有人有意见吗012---Does anybody have a problem with that?
嘿  新来的012---Hey, new guy.
我说有人有意见吗012---I said, does anybody have a problem with that?
没有012---No, ma'am.
嘿  他有名字  他叫龙哥012---Hey! He has a name. It's Dragon.
想知道你的名字吗  看看你的帽子012---You want to know your name? Check your hat.
我们写在上面了  是吧012---We did the hat, right?
刚刚那是怎么回事  真的很抱歉012---What the hell just happened? I am so-so-so sorry.
我真的很想配合你012---I was going to do it.Really!
但我一手拿着327块012---But I was standing there with $327 in one hand...
另一手拿着238块 我在想...012---...and $238 in the other. And I was thinking...
我很久没拿到…012---"Wow! It's been a long time since I had…
327块加238块  这么多钱了012---...327 plus $238!
乔伊  我们说好的  我用你就是为了开除你012---Joey, We had a deal! That-that's why you're here. I've got to fire you!
但是我要付房租的012---And I got to pay rent!
这样吧  你别开除我012---how-how about this? You don't fire me,
我留在这里争取他们的信任012---instead I stay here, I gain their trust.
我说你的好话  他们就听得进去了012---and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
什么好话012---What nice things?
还没有  他们恨死你了 我想跟他们打成一片012---Well Nothing yet. they really hate you and I want to fit in.
钱德  摩妮卡  光明节快乐  圣诞012---Happy Hanukkah, Chandler and Monica, Merry, merry...
菲比  你知道吗012---Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
我不是犹太人  所以...012---I'm not Jewish so...
罗斯也没有用绒毛装饰他的圣诞树012---So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss,
他有没有跟你抱怨过  天啊012---but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
做恶梦啦012---Bad dream?
我根本没睡着012---I wasn't sleeping.
是吗  那菲比刚刚在唱什么歌012---Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
关于小猫什么的012---The one with the cat.
我得走了  又有约会012---I got to go. I've got another date.
那么  你选谁了012---So, did you pick one yet?
没有  现在反而城里的那个女孩开始讲笑话012---No, it turns out the one from uptown was making a joke.
但是我根本不懂她的笑话  而且没那么好笑012---But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn't that funny.
我还是两头跑  左右为难012---So I'm still torn.
你看  你根本不喜欢城里的那个女孩012---Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown
为了跟波敔浦夕妞约会  累得疲惫不堪012---and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie,
所以跟他们两个都分手  怎么样012---so I say you just end them both. Okay?
坐火车去波敔浦夕跟她分手012---You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her,
然后回来的路上跟城里的那个姑娘也分手012---and on your way back you break up with uptown.
到家时一切都解决了  搞定012---And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
对  你说得对  谢谢012---Y'know, You're right. Thank you.
我在布拉格也碰到过这种问题012---Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
布拉格  还有很多事你不知道呢012---Prague? So much you don't know.
钱德012---Chandler?
派崔克刚刚跟我分手了012---Patrick just, uh, ended things with me.
你有没有告诉他  我想认真谈段感情012---Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
我说了  当然说了012---I did! I absolutely did!
你个白痴012---You idiot!
我知道你说得对  但是  为什么012---I'm sure you're right. But why?
你不该告诉他我要谈段认真的感情  你不该告诉他的012---You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that!
你看  把他吓跑了012---Now you scared him away!
噢  伙计  我非常遗憾  我非常非常遗憾012---Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
应该禁止你跟别人说话012---Y'know, You should never be allowed to talk to people!
我知道  没错012---I know, I know!
噢  我又回到起点了012---Oh! See just I'm now right back where I started!
超难过012---Aww, this sucks!
孤孤单单的真难过012---Being alone sucks!
呃  你知道  你迟早会遇见意中人012---Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody!
你是个好对象012---You're a great catch!
你知道么  我跟同事形容你时  根本不需要美化你012---Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
真的吗  真的012---Really? Yeah.
你是从Magma Ku Laude毕业的  是吧012---You graduated magna cum laude, right?
不是012---No.
噢  不要紧012---Oh, it doesn't matter.
我有两张今晚球赛的门票  要不要跟我去看012---Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
看猛男穿短裤满场飞012---Cute guys in little shorts?
当然012---Sure.
但今晚是冰上曲棍球赛012---Actually, it's a hockey team.
你只能看到  "愤怒无齿的加拿大人"（曲棍球队名）012---so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
好像挺好玩的  谢谢你012---Well that sounds fun too. Thank you.
你有跟女人在一起过吗012---Have you ever been with a woman?
什么012---What?
钱德  你有毛病012---Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
不管什么时候问这个问题  都会被人骂012---So there is no good time to ask that question.
下一站是波放浦夕012---The station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
罗斯012---Ross?
罗斯012---Ross?
醒醒012---Wake up!
罗斯…012---Ross? Ross! Ross!
我还要些旗鱼012---I need more swordfish.
能帮我拿些旗鱼么  我不讲英文012---Can you get me more swordfish? I don't speak English.
你刚讲的就是英文012---You did a minute ago!
我只是不知道跟你说什么012---well, I don't know what to tell you.
好吧012---Fine.
好了  够了012---Okay! Very funny!
谁来开下门012---Somebody let me out please?!
快点  里面好冷012---Come on, I'm cold!
现在又被泼了一身的酱汁012---And covered in marinara sauce!
快点  放我出去012---Come on! Let me out!
找到把手啦  是么012---You found that handle, did you?
这一点也不好笑  谁说不好笑012---It's not funny. Well, that's not true.
我是个好人  也是个好厨师012---I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef.
我不该被弄得全身都是酱汁012---and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me!
如果你们想我辞职  只要012---If you want me to quit this bad then you all have...
盖勒主厨012---Hey. Chef Geller?

我有意见012---I got a problem with it!
你不同意   没错012---You do? You bet I do!
只是我当时没专心听  就是这样012---I just, uh, wasn't listening then, that's all.
你想鸡蛋里挑骨头  就别怪我不客气了012---Well if you want a problem, I'll give you a problem!
你想怎样  开除我吗012---What are you going to do? Fire me?
那还用说  滚出我的厨房012---You bet I'll fire you! Get out of my kitchen!
滚012---Get out!

在我跟主厨顶嘴之前012---Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids...
真该想想家中妻小012---...before I talked back to Chef Geller.

祝各位佳节快乐012---Happy holidays, everybody!
啊  天呀  真不敢相信  弟弟你已经结婚了012---Oh my God! I can’t believe my little brother is married!
你们俩为什么不告诉我你们准备结婚012---You guys, why didn’t you tell me you were eloping?
因为我们之前也没有想过结婚这事  那天我们去法院  我们正在吃午饭012---'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch…
等等  你们去法院做什么呀012---Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
我们去吃午饭呀012---We were having lunch.
然后  我们突然之间意识到012---Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like,
嘿   我们正在法院吃饭  吃完饭我们去登记结婚吧012---"Hey! Y'know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married! right!
哇  一年半以前我甚至都不知道自己有个弟弟  现在我还有弟媳了012---Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too.
真是太棒了012---Oh, it's so great.
好了  够了012---Okay. Okay.
别再亲了012---Stop it, don't. So,
我得送你们新婚礼物才行012---I'll get you a gift now.
你们需要什么吗012---Is there anything you need?
嗯  有啊012---Uh, yeah.
我们俩一直努力想要个孩子  嗯  几乎从我们订婚那天就开始了  我们非常着急012---We've been trying to get pregnant. uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we'd get a jump on things,
你也知道  我们都不年轻了012---y'know no one's getting any younger. Ha-ha-ha.
但情况是  嗯  她不能怀孕012---Because the thing is, um, we're not able to, you know, uh, conceive.
我们什么方法都试过了  也去看了不少医生012---And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
医生说了  我们有孩子的唯一的机会就是012---Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby ...
把我的精子和她的卵子  放在一个器皿里012---...is that if they take my sperm, her egg, and put it together in a dish...
再放进另一个女孩的子宫里012---...and put it into another girl.
因此我们在想  你可不可以成为那个女生  把它放进去012---So we were wondering if you could be that girl that we could put it into.
那真是一个美好的礼物012---That's a really nice gift.
我刚刚还以为是要放到酱油壶里呢012---I was thinking of a gravy boat.
老友记  第四季 第14集  菲比外借子宫012---The One With Phoebe’s Uterus
嘿  快来看看  快来看看  猜我找到什么工作了012---Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess what job I just got.
不知道  但是Donald Trump（赌场大亨）想让他的蓝色运动夹克变黑所以借你穿脏点.012---I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
什么012---What?
我是说要回  他想要回他的夹克012---Blue blazer back. He wants it back.
你刚才是说 "变黑"   他为什么想把他的蓝色夹克变黑呢012---You said "black." Why would he want his blue blazer black?
你知道我的意思012---Well, you know what I meant.
不是  你弄混了012---No,You messed it up.
你真蠢012---You're stupid.
乔伊  你找到什么工作了012---So what job did you get Joe?
博物馆里的解说员   罗斯帮我争取到的012---Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
要成为解说员  不得是恐龙或者是历史专家吗012---Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
不  其实不用  他们会把资料都给你012---No, not really. They give you all the information.
嗯  就跟背剧本一样012---it's uh, it's like memorizing a script.
"在您的左边  您看到的是暴龙  一种来自侏罗纪的肉食动物."012---"And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
不赖嘛012---Very nice.
嗯  其实暴龙是来自白垩纪012---Yeah, actually, Joey, it's the Cretaceous Period.
是  但我念得是侏罗纪012---Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
嗨012---Hey!
你们猜怎么了  法兰克和艾莉丝结婚了012---Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
啊  天啊012---Oh, my God!
还有  还有  他们要生小孩了012---And! And, they’re gonna have a baby!
还有  还有  他们还要用我的子宫来生012---And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
天啊  你没开玩笑吧012---My God! Are you serious?
是啊012---Yeah.
你在考虑和自己的弟弟上床012---You're thinking of having sex with your brother?
你好恶心  才不是012---Ewww! And "Oh no!"
他们只是要找我代孕012---It's—they just want me to be the surrogate.
用他们的精子和卵子  我只是烤炉  面包完全是他们的012---It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
那你答应了没012---What did you tell them?
他们说先让我考虑考虑  但是这有什么可考虑的呢012---Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about?
这是我能送出的最好的礼物012---I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
你将要帮他们怀孩子  还给他们一台索尼PS012---You'll carry their child, and get them a Sony PlayStation?
亲爱的  为他们这么做  的确是一件惊人的喜事012---Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them,
但是有些事你得再想想012---But there are things to think about.
是呀  你将要怀孕  是怀孕呀012---Yeah, you'd be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
我知道啊012---I know.
菲比  你的身体将接受一段可怕的经历012---Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
我是说  如晨吐  嗯  分娩012---I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour,
还全都是为了别人012---and it's all for somebody else!
是啊  你的要点是什么012---Yeah. What's your point?
我刚才说的就是啊012---Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
不知道我这辈子会不会那么做012---Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that.
我一直在想  如果我第一次怀孕  一定是为一个我爱的人012---Y'know I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love
而且我得照顾…012---and that baby would be a
那个孩子012---...a keeper.
我当初想做家具时  你们可是很支持我的012---Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
不是  菲比  如果你决定要这么做  我们当然会全力支持你的012---No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
我们只是要你考虑清楚012---We just want you to think it through.
对  亲爱的  也许你可以和生过孩子的人聊聊  例如你妈妈012---Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom.
我妈才没生过小孩呢  不过我的生母有012---My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did!
我喜欢你的小屁屁  可以让我带去上班吗012---I love this tushy! Can I take it to work with me?
哦  没问题  反正不是我的 是买裤子附赠的012---Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.
我嫉妒死了012---I am so jealous.
你们俩正在那个阶段  对吧012---You guys are really right…there aren’t you?
是啊012---Yes.
哪个阶段012---Right where?
热恋期  一天到晚的甜言蜜语012---In the beginning where it's all sex and talking...
不眠不休的性生活  还有012---...and sex and talking.and…
聊天的部分很棒012---Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
那上床呢012---And the sex?
好  我们还没上过床012---All right, we haven’t had sex yet.
对  那又能怎么样  你知道  这次恋爱对我来说很特殊012---Okay, What's the big deal? Y'know? This is special,
我想充分培养感情  再更上一层楼012---and I want our love to grow before we move on to the next level.
钱德  你那么做好体贴呀012---Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.
是很体贴012---That is really nice...
骗人012---...lying!
不可能是你说的那个原因  为什么012---No way is that the reason. Why?
只是因为你还不够成熟  去理解像这样的事情012---Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
不  罗斯说的对  我是在骗人012---No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
那真相是什么012---Then what is it?
因为Kathy的前任男友是乔伊012---Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
你担心自己…技不如人012---And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?
不  我担心自己床上功夫没他行012---No, I'm afraid I won't make love as well as him.
对  我刚刚在用比喻012---Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
对  我刚刚是直接说出来012---Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
没事啦  乔伊交过一卡车女友  这也不表示他床功一流012---So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
我们的房只隔着一面墙012---We share a wall.
因此  要么他在床上极强悍  要么就是她喜欢附和他012---So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
亲爱的  她和你将会不同的  有爱做基础的性会更棒012---Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different.The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
是吗  是啊012---Yeah? Yeah.
钱德  你大胆的向前012---Just go for it Chandler.
对  试试看就知道了012---Yeah, you should, really.
那好吧  我这就去和女朋友睡觉012---All right. all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend.
但我这么做  全是为了你们012---But I'm just doing it for you guys.
接下来这头乳齿象  是来自侏罗纪中后期012---Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
乳齿象不是来自上新世吗012---Isn't the mastodon from the Pliocene Epoch?
嘘嘘  这里是博物馆  不许讲话012---Shh.This is a museum, no talking.
这里的就是…012---Right down here we have...
大脚012---...a large foot.
这位是罗斯盖勒012---And over here we have Ross Geller.
大家挥手和罗斯打招呼  说 "嗨"012---Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.
罗斯是博物馆里最重要的科学家之一  快看看他  工作多努力012---Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.
好  继续参观012---Okay, moving right along.
走吧012---Come on.
门开着呢  进来吧012---It's open! Come in!
抱歉迟到了  没关系012---I'm sorry I'm late. That's okay.
我正好有时间给乳头上釉012---it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
哇  你为了见客还真是拼命012---Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
没有  我刚刚在做陶器012---No, I was working on my pottery.
哇  哦012---Oh! Oh!
我不知道你会做…罐子012---Oh! I didn't know that you did pot.
对  大部分是裸体的  它结合了我的两大嗜好  陶器和色情艺术012---Well, yeah, Mostly nudes. It combines my two passions: Pottery and erotica.
哦  就叫 "情色陶器" 吧012---Ooh, erotiery!
不错012---Hey! Okay!
谢谢你来看我  我只是012---Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just
我只是觉得生小孩这件事  还是当面聊比较好012---I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.Okay.
菲比  我真的认为你不应该那么做012---I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
为什么012---Why not?
因为  你最后还得送走孩子012---Well, because you'd be giving up a baby,
我不知道…012---And I really don't...
我不知道怎么说才能让你理解012---I don't know if there's anything I can say...
送走孩子会有多么痛苦012---...that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.
所以012---So...
不   我了解那种痛苦  不要伤害小狗012---No, no, I understand the pain. Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
不  不是啦  这小狗是你的了012---No, no. The puppy is yours.
我有小狗012---Oh, I get a puppy!
对  但你只能拥有三天012---Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
为什么012---Why?
我知道我没有权利像母亲一样管你  但是012---Y'know. I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now,
菲比  麻烦别看小狗  看着我  这事非常重要012---uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
好012---Okay.
我是说  我知道自己以前做了什么012---I mean, I know what I'm talking about.
我抛弃了2个孩子012---I gave up two babies.
而且我真的希望  当时身边能有个前辈告诉我012---and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me...
抛弃自己的孩子会有多痛苦012---...how terrible it is to give up babies.
我只是在想  那么做的后果将会是遗恨终生012---I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life.
你到时候送走这条小狗的痛苦012---So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy...
还不及送走孩子的百万分之一012---...it would be a million times harder to give up a child.
早知道  我真不应该先给你小狗012---I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
你介意坐在别处吗  我帮朋友罗斯留着这个座呢012---Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.
你是说盖勒博士012---You mean Dr. Geller?
博士  我不知道他还有一个绰号012---Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
他才不会坐在这里012---Oh, he won't sit here.
穿白袍的都会坐在那里012---Only the people in the white coats sit over there,
穿蓝色外套的就只能坐这里012---and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
为什么这样012---Well, how-how come?
这里就是这样012---That's just the way it is.
太荒唐啦012---That's crazy.
在完美的世界里  这或许是有些荒唐  一个不分研究员和解说员的世界012---Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world: A world without lab coats and blazers.
但你不是活在完美世界里   你是在这个博物馆012---But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now.
看到那戴眼镜的科学家没012---See that scientist in the classes,
他和我以前在小学时总是在一起玩  现如今却....012---he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now…
彼德  嗨  彼德012---Peter! Hey, Peter!
我是朗姐  我们是同届的啊012---It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?
亏我把布丁分你吃过012---I shared my pudding with you, man!
我还把点心棒送给你吃012---I gave you my snack pack!
看到没  他甚至假装没听到我说的话012---See? He pretend he don't even hear me!
我想大家都在假装没听到你说话012---I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you.
总之  我不了解你  我才不管什么制服和餐桌的分别的事012---Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, ...
不过罗斯是我最好的朋友之一012---...but Ross is one of my best friends,
而且我要是为他留了座位  我告诉你  他肯定会坐在这里012---and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it!
罗斯  罗斯012---Ross. Ross.
这里  我帮你留了个座位012---Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
不用  我坐这边很好  我一会去找你012---That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
这个位置有人坐了012---Op, this is saved.
礼品店的012---Gift shop.
今天在自助餐厅的事  我真的  真的非常抱歉012---Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
没什么  嘿   真的  你是迫不得已  对吧012---It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
不只是我而已  我是说科学家和解说员从来都不坐在一起012---But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
随便你啦012---Whatever.
到处都这样  摩妮卡  帮我说说话啊012---It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here.
在你工作那里  服务员也是和服务员一起吃饭  对吧012---Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
并且厨师和厨师一起吃  对吧012---And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
我自己在走廊里自己吃饭  因为人人都讨厌我012---I eat by myself in the alley, because everybody hates me.
罗斯  你听我说012---Look, Ross.
真的  真的没什么012---really it's-it's no big deal.
你知道你穿白袍  我穿蓝色制服012---Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer,
如果那代表着我们不能在单位成为朋友  那就这样吧012---If that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it.Y'know,
我理解012---hey I understand. Y'know?
嘿  当我在舞台上  你在观众席上  我也没和你说话  对吧012---Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right?
所以  你知道  没事012---So it's, you know, it's, uh, cool.
明天见012---I'll see you tomorrow.
对  当他在舞台上时是没有和我们说话  但他确实挥过手012---Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
嗨012---Hi.
菲比  为什么对着卡尔马登(电影演员)唱歌012---Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?
我想现在又到遛狗的时间了012---Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again.
走  我们去阳台  什么012---Come on, let's go to the balcony. What?
哦  是街道  快点  我们上街去012---Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street.
听着  我回来之前别去阳台012---Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
怎么样  你做了吗012---So did you do it?
是  是  我们做爱了012---Yes, yes, we had the sex.
糟糕  不好喔012---Uh-oh. It was bad?
还可以  但是她附和我的程度  不像附和乔伊那样强烈012---It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey.
感觉像是 "我了解  无所谓"012---She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
没关系  你们毕竟是第一次嘛  不可能一开始就和谐的012---Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
对啊  通常都是女人觉得还不够和谐  男人却很快就满足了012---Yeah. Not for girls, anyway. Guys agree like that.
看  你得帮帮我  行吗012---Look, you have to help me. Okay?
我是说…012---I mean...
我知道该做些什么  我也知道哪里总是让人感觉美妙012---I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice.
但我需要知道…012---But I need to know ...
要使得她从美妙到…012---...what makes it go from nice to...
"天呀  那家伙让她欲仙欲死"012---..."My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
我来告诉你  很多男人不知道的 "密笈"012---All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know.
瑞秋  麻烦把那本子给我012---Rach, give me that pad, please?
好吧012---All right.
来012---Now.
你不用画的那么具体  哇  身材惹火012---Look, You don't have to draw an actual... Whoa, she's hot!
好  每个人都知道的  基本的性敏感带012---Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.
第1个  第2个  第3个012---You got one, two, three...
第4个…012---...four...
第5个  第6个还有第7个012---...five, six and seven.
一共有7个012---There are seven?

看他们有多幸福012---Look how happy they are.
是我给他们带来快乐  所以…012---And I made that, so... Y'know
我知道送走自己生出来的孩子  一定会难上百万倍012---it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God,

但是菲比  不-不-不  我知道012---But Phoebe... No-no-no, I know,
我们是不同的人012---but you and I are different people though,
而且情况和你当年也完全不同012---and this is a totally different situation,

五个  那我生的时候012---Five? Okay, where am I giving birth
去医院还是要准备个大盒子012---in a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
植入五个胚胎  表示着床机率大概是25%012---Ha, ha. We do five because that gives you a 25-percent chance...that at least one will attach.
25%这么少012---That's it? Twenty-five percent?
也就是说有75%的可能根本就没有孩子012---That means that it's, like, 75-percent chance of no baby at all?
嘿  我想  要是放进200个胚胎012---Yeah, you know, I was thinking, what are the odds
那成功的机会是多少012---if, like, you stuff, like, 200 of them in there?

不过  事实上  我们只能有一次机会012---Well, see, the thing is, we kind of only have one shot.
做一次移植要花一万六千块012---Um, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.
为了这次  我们差不多花光了所有的积蓄012---So, um, we're kind of using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
天啊012---Whoa.
这让我和我的子宫  感觉压力好大012---That's... Okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.
那么  好吧012---So... Well, okay.
也许我能做些什么事  来提高怀孕的机率012---So maybe there's something that I can do, you know, just to make sure I get pregnant.
没有  很抱歉012---No, I'm sorry.

拿皮包扔它012---Throw your purses at it.
布鲁明戴尔裁减了我的部门012---Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
天哪  你失业了吗  没有  但我被塞到专人采购部012---Oh, my God. Are you out of a job? No, they stuck me in Personal Shopping...
比原来矮了一大截012---...which is just a huge step down.

跟一个大帅哥012---...with a real good-looking guy.
这就像有人把我的恶梦写成戏012---Yeah, it was like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare...
还要我花上32块钱去看012---...and then charged me $32 to see it.
这个点子有赚头012---That's a good idea for a business.
我受不了了  他们会在台上夜夜打得火热012---I'm totally screwed, okay? They're gonna be hot and heavy on-stage every night...
然后去参加剧组派对  会设法中伤我012---...and then they're gonna go to their cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.
像是 "你男朋友呢  他叫什么钱斯特吗"012---You know, he'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend? What's his name, Chester?"
她会说 "不  不  不  是钱德"  他就说“随便啦”012---And she'll go, "No, no, no. It's Chandler." He'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha."

工作总要逢场作戏  但不是都会弄假成真的012---Just because they work together doesn't mean they'll get together.
就像苏珊莎兰登和提姆罗宾斯也会那样做012---Just because it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...

他们在台上演床戏时  真的很火热吗012---When they were doing it on-stage, was it like really hot?
对啊012---Huh. Oh, yeah.
那就没问题了012---Well, okay, so then you're fine.
如果两个演员私底下在一起012---Look, the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage...
他们之间的火花就会消失012---...then all the sexual tension between them is gone.
只要台上很火热  你就不用担心012---Okay? So as long as it's hot on-stage, you got nothing to worry about.
台上没有了火热度  你就有麻烦了012---It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
真的吗012---Really?
你们看过我演的每出戏012---You guys have been to every play I've been in.
我有在台上擦出过火花吗012---Have I ever had chemistry on-stage?
没有  对吧012---No. No.
你晚上要陪我去看戏吗012---So, uh, man, are you gonna go see the play with me tonight?
我不知道  看你女朋友012---You know what? I don't know how comfortable I am...
跟别人亲热  我觉得很尴尬012---...going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
我知道  但是  不  我人在现场012---Yeah, I know... No, no, no, oh, I'm there.
嘿  嘿  摩妮卡012---Hey. Hey, Mon.

我很喜欢  你演得很棒012---I loved the play. Uh, yeah, you were great.
尼克也是012---And, uh, Nick, ditto.

好012---Okay.
很明显  我在跟他做爱012---Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
拜托  太明显了  你们之间没有任何火花012---Oh, come on. It was so obvious. There was no chemistry between you two.
好的  让我先搞清楚012---Okay, let me just get this straight.
你先指责我不忠  又侮辱我的演技012---You're accusing me of cheating on you, and you're insulting my performance?
当然啊  这也难怪我能看到012---You know, I can see how this could happen.
你们每天晚上都光着身体  爱抚  热吻012---You know, you're up there every night, naked, touching, kissing.
那是演戏啊  钱德  这是我的工作012---Acting. Chandler, this is my job.
这是剧中场景  我是在演戏  你怎么可以不相信我012---I'm playing a part in a play. How can you not trust me?
你应该明白  我们就是这样开始的012---Well, you can understand, given how we started.
你居然拿这个来攻击我012---I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
事实如此  你刚才也没否认012---Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this.
够了  等你长成熟了再来找我012---I'll tell you what, Chandler. Why don't you call me when you grow up?
好啊  那你可有得时间等了012---Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen any time soon.

没什么  约书亚对V字领有些看法  现场听才好玩012---Nothing, it's just something Joshua said about V-necks, but you had to be there.
杰森穿V字领  好看吗012---How does, uh, Jason look in a V-neck?
是约书亚  随便啦012---It's Joshua. Oh, whatever.

也有女生看的黄色杂志012---I've got porn for you too.
我不需要012---Yeah, I don't need it.
大家应该呆在这里012---People are supposed to want to hang out here.
为什么  亲爱的  有什么大不了的012---Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
我是女主人012---I'm the hostess.
不是那些臭男生  我一直都是女主人012---Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.
连小的时候  别的女生都会带着她们的新娃娃到我的舞会012---I mean, even when I was little, the girls brought their dollies to my tea party.
我能提供最好的氛围012---I served the best air.
那你干嘛让大家烦恼012---Why did you make a whole big thing...
叫大家去大的地方012---...out of everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
我想惩罚他们  因为抢走了我们的公寓012---'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them.
我惩罚完了  他们也吃到苦头了012---But I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
要惩罚他们  就该把他们关在外面012---If you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here.
那倒是012---Yeah, that's true.
我一定会让这里比对面好十倍012---All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
我们要捣毁对面吗012---Oh, are we gonna trash their place?
台阶012---Steps.
贱人012---Slut.
你们一定很乐于听到   凯西在跟那个人上床012---You'll all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy.

我当面问她  她并没有否认012---I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.
我不住这里012---I don't live here.
钱德  她怎么说的012---Chandler. Chandler, what did she say?
等等   你确定吗012---Wait a minute. Come here.are you sure?
我也许是醉了  但我听得懂她的话012---Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said.
所以我跑去朱理牛排012---So then I went over to Beefsteak Chewley's...

你和我总是012---See, you and I have always been like:
哎哟012---Oops.
嘿  需要帮忙吗  不用了012---Hey, do you need help with that? No, I got it.
我感觉好糟  从没这样空虚过012---Oh, I just feel bad. I never vacuum.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
今天我和约书亚在一起1小时了  他还没约我出去012---So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
真让人灰心  那你就约他嘛012---It's so frustrating. Why don't you ask him out?
没错  感觉会很刺激012---Oh, yeah. Totally. That's such a turn-on.
真的  看起来感觉不会很饥渴吗012---Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
那样才刺激012---Ooh, that's the turn-on.
他刚离婚  跟女人相处可能会紧张012---He just got a divorce, right? So he's probably really nervous around women.
你就先主动嘛  迈出你的第一步012---You know? Maybe you just need to make the first move.
我以前从没约过男生出去  你没约过男生出去012---I've never asked a guy out before. You've never asked a guy out?
没有  你呢012---No, have you?
上千次了吧012---Thousands of times. Ha, ha.
这也不是什么光荣的事  对吧012---That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?
我都不知道该怎么去做012---I don't even know how I would go about it.
我会从头到尾打量一个女人  然后说012---Oh, what I do is, uh, I look a woman up and down and I say:
嘿012---"Hey.
"你在做什么"012---How you doing?"
拜托012---Oh, please.
嘿012---Hey.
你要怎样做012---How you doing?
好  我也这样做012---You know what? I'm gonna do that.
现在就打电话约他  约他出来012---I'm gonna call him up and I'm gonna ask him out.
好  有什么难的   约就约012---Yeah. I can do that. Ask him out.
你好吗012---"How you doing?"
喂  约书亚012---Hi, Joshua?
瑞秋葛林  布鲁明戴尔的012---It's Rachel Green, from Bloomingdale's.
对了  我想问你是不是012---Yeah, um, I was just wondering if you, um...
是不是012---If you, um...
今天在店里掉了皮夹012---Left your wallet at the store today?
我们捡到一个皮夹  我们012---Oh, well, we found a wallet, and we...
那驾驶证  好主意012---The license? Oh, that is a good idea.
嗯   让我看看   驾照是一位012---Uh, well, let's see. This license belongs to a, uh...
叫菲比先生的012---Uh, belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.
对012---And, um, yeah.
抱歉打扰你了  明天见  拜拜012---So okay. So sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
你做过几千次了  我从没做过012---You've done that a thousand times? I've never done that.
天呐  我只是担心他不答应012---Oh, God, I just got so nervous that he was gonna say no.
你得让他无法拒绝  就像  尼克队的球票012---Well, you gotta give him something he can't say no too, like, uh, Knicks tickets.
约他去看尼克队的比赛  他一定会答应012---Invite the guy to a Knicks game. You're guaranteed he'll say yes.
你觉得有用  绝对的  不行  我去行吗012---Really? You think that will work? Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
什么声音012---What the heck is that?
她有打来吗012---Did she call?
没有  抱歉012---No. Sorry.
也许我应该打给她  不要012---Well, maybe I should call her. No.
忘了她吧  你不需要她的  不必这样啊012---Forget her, man. You don't need her. Don't need that.
没错  她的所作所为让人无法原谅012---He's right. What she did was unforgivable.
对啊  但你要知道  假如是我错了呢012---Well, yeah, but you know, what if I was wrong?
你怎么会错的012---How might you be wrong?
要是她没跟那个人上床呢012---Well, you know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
大哥  告诉我这是她跟你说的012---Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
她没有  是我看了她的戏感觉他们之间毫无火花012---She did not have to tell me. I saw the play and there was no heat.
罗斯  帮我说句话  你就根据这个012---Back me up here, Ross. That's all your basing this on?
这不是在帮我012---That's not backing me up.
你说过私底下如果有热情012---You said, you know, with the off-stage and the heat...
在台上表演就会没有012---...and the on-stage and the heat... Whoa, whoa.
那只是个理论  很多理论都行不通的012---That was just a theory. There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out.
孤枪侠  共产主义  几何学012---Lone gunman, communism, geometry.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
约书亚  你要不要去看篮球012---"Joshua, Would you like to go to a basketball game with..."

这样看起来还真配012---Oh, yeah. Yeah, this looks great.
你喜欢吗012---Um, so you like it?
对  很喜欢  实际上  我是想在家里穿的012---I do, I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
太好了  谢谢你的帮助012---Great. Well, thank you so much for all your help.
我想是的   那就这样012---Well, I guess, uh... I guess this is it. Yeah.
谢了012---Thanks.
或许我春天再过来  找你买泳衣012---Maybe I'll see you in the spring with the... For the bathing suits.

我真是世上最笨最笨的白痴了012---You know, I acted like the biggest idiot in the world.
我完全明白你为什么这么伤心012---And I can completely understand why you were so upset.
我希望你给我打电话012---I really wish you'd called me.
我知道  我也很后悔012---Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.
不过我觉得这是好事  对吧012---But, you know, I think this is a good thing. You know?
我们吵了第一次架  现在关系有进展了012---Because we've had our first fight, and now we can move on.

对012---Yeah.
那好012---Yeah. Well.

好  下次你会怎么说  "我有一张多余的门票"012---Okay, for next time, what do you say? "I have an extra ticket."
"一张多余的门票" 而不是 "两张"  "我有一张多余的门票"012---"An extra ticket." Not "two tickets." I have and extra ticket.
你第一次约男生出去  就被拒绝012---So the first time you asked a guy out he turned you down?
他并没有拒绝我   他参加比赛了012---He didn't turn me down. He's at the game, isn't he?
我约到他了  只是我没去012---I got the date. I'm just not on it.
都弄好了012---Okay, it's ready.
来吧  什么弄好了012---Come on. What's ready?

你在说什么  我在说她是个恶女人012---What are you saying? I'm saying that she is a devil woman.
你认识她这么个人012---You think you know a person...
才一转身  就跑回去跟尼克上床012---...then they turn around and they sleep with Nick.
尼克和他的大胸肌  还有他的大咪咪012---Nick and his rock-hard pecs and his giant man-nipples.

我不恨她  我爱她  都是我的错  真的012---Well, I don't hate her. I love her. This is all my fault, really.
不会吧  怎么会是你的错012---Oh. How? How is it your fault?
因为我该给她打电话的012---Because, ugh, I should have called.
要是吵完后我马上打给她  她就不会跟尼克出去约会了012---You know, if I'd just called her, she never would have gone out with Nick...
他们也就不会上床了012---...and they wouldn't have ended up in bed together.
是我亲手把她送给他了012---I threw her at his man-nipples.
宝贝  这不是你的错012---Honey, this is not your fault.
就算吵架  她也不该跟别人上床012---Just because you guys had a fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.
除非她以为你们分手了012---Well, if she thought they were on a break...

真不敢相信  凯西居然会这么对我  我真的把她当作自己今生唯一的伴侣012---Y'know,I can't believe Kathy did this to me. I really thought that she was the one.
算了  告诉你们012---Well, I'll tell you what.
从现在开始  我再也不会离开这张椅子了012---From now on, I am not getting out of this chair, ever.
从现在开始  这椅子就是我的唯一012---Okay? From now on, this chair is the one.
你们知道还有什么  我的运动裤012---You know what else is the one? My sweat pants.
别这样  老兄  把裤子脱下来好么012---Come on, man, just take the sweats off, okay?
快脱吧  我们来玩一玩012---Just take them off and we'll have some fun.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
钓到大鱼了吗  天呀  你们肯定不信012---Did you catch any big fish? Oh, my God, you guys have no idea.
哦  天呀  你好臭啊012---Oh, wow. Oh, my God, you stink.
搞什么呢012---Oh, are you kidding?
我待在湖上  整整三天没洗澡012---Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower.
而且  还掉进一个装鱼饵的桶里了012---Plus, I fell into that big tub of worms at the bait stand.
嗨  他怎么样了012---Hey, how's he doing?
他已经两天没离开过那张椅子了012---He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
嗨  兄弟  你还好吗012---Ahem. Hey, buddy, how's it going?
看见了么  好兄弟回家就没事了012---You see that? He just needed his pal to come home.
好了  我得去背台词了012---All right, uh, I gotta go memorize my lines.
明天一早  要和却尔登希斯顿演戏012---Me and Charlton Heston, bright and early tomorrow, baby.
好耶  好耶012---Yeah. Yeah.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿   摩妮卡012---Hey. Hey, Monica.
怎么了012---Uh-oh. What's the matter? Oh...
约书亚约我今晚去一家刚开业的高级夜总会012---Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
可我已经答应沃森先生012---But I already told Mr. Waltham...
带他的侄女去看什么破歌剧012---...that I would take his niece to the dumb old opera.
唉  怎么办呢012---So, what are you gonna do?
我也不知道  亲爱的  不行  帮帮我012---I don't know, sweetie. No. Help me.
我不行  我要上班  菲比012---I can't. I have to work. Phoebe?
我倒是很想  可我晚上有妊娠反应012---I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
除非  她想整晚上都过不安生012---Ooh, no, unless she wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
拜托  天哪  你们  我一定要去见约书亚012---Ugh. Gosh, you guys, come on. This is... I have to meet Joshua.
这是唯一的机会  让他看看有趣的瑞秋012---This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel.
也许 他会想 "要是瑞秋是我老婆该多好呀"012---You know, the "Wouldn't it be great if she were my wife?" Rachel.
算了  乔伊和钱德回来了吗012---Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
没有  钱德还在第一阶段  乔伊身上的味道你总该闻见了吧012---Oh, Chandler's still in phase one, and Joey's that thing you smell.
嗨012---Hi.
嗨012---Hi!
所以…012---So?
不要012---No.
拜托啦012---Oh, come on.
应该是她  等下  等下  罗斯  拜托啦012---I think she's here. No, wait, wait, wait. Ross, please?
你要我带一个不认识的女生  去看歌剧012---You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera...
好让你去夜总会  跟某个男人打情骂俏012---...so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy?
真难决定啊012---Hmm. Yeah, that is a toughie.
她在四处张望012---Oh, she's looking down the hall.
她在看我012---Oh! She looked right at me.
等等  这洞从外面看不进来  对吧012---Oh, wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you?
你好啊012---Hello.
你好012---Hello? Aah!
我马上出来  罗斯  拜托啦  帮帮忙吧012---Oh, I'll be right there. Okay, Ross, please. Come on.
我以为我们之间的事都过去了012---I thought we had moved on.
我以为我们可以彼此相互祝福了012---I thought we'd gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other.
难道只是我这样想么012---I mean was that just me?
好吧  我答应你  谢谢你  谢谢你  谢谢你012---All right, I'll do it. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
艾蜜莉  是012---Emily? Yes.
我是瑞秋葛林  谢天谢地012---I'm Rachel Green. Thank goodness.
计划有小小的变动  我晚上没空  所以…012---There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So…
是吗012---Really? Heh.
真是太巧了  不是么  我一定是没接到你的电话  虽然我整天都没出门012---Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
不  其实我  不  不  不  还算好啦012---Well, no, I... No, no, no, that's not rude.
我这一路上012---It's perfectly in keeping with a trip...
差点儿被你们热狗车撞倒012---...where I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts...
在约翰F肯尼迪机场  又被脱衣搜身012---...and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport.
显然  我长得就像012---Apparently, I look like someone...
屁股里塞满了可卡因012---...who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
我-我-我觉得你很漂亮啊012---I-I-I think you look great.
再见  很高兴认识你们012---Good night. It was very nice to meet you all.
我去追她012---I'll get her.
快去  好012---Please hurry. Okay.
他们讲话好好玩012---Don't you just love the way they talk?
怎么了  踢我了  孩子踢我了012---What? It kicked. I think the baby kicked.
天啊  上帝呀  噢012---Oh, my God. Ha, ha.
不对  是内裤的松紧带断了012---Oh, no, wait. Oh. That was the elastic in my underwear busted.
完了  我睡过头了012---Oh, my God. I overslept.
通告是半小时前就要到场的  我得赶快012---I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago. I gotta get out of here.
你不能这样出去吧  你好臭012---What? Joey, you can't go like that. You stink.
没办法啊  我还没洗澡就睡着了  现在没时间了012---Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time!
才十条街  用跑的还来得及012---They're 10 blocks away. If I run, I can make it.
那是  跑10个街区  你会更臭了012---Yeah, run 10 blocks. That'll help the smell.
慢一点  算了  快跑012---Hey. Whoa! Slow down. No, keep moving. Whoa.
昨晚怎么样啊  我没见到约书亚012---So how did it go with Joshua last night? Oh. Well, I didn't see Joshua.
但我揍了一个女生一拳012---But I did punch a girl in the face.
什么   为什么012---What? Why?
昨晚真的很倒楣   倾盆大雨012---The whole night was horrible. It was pouring rain.
到了现场  名单上没有瑞秋葛林  只有瑞秋葛皮012---and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
那你见到她了么012---Oh. So did you get to meet her?
没有  根本没这个人  但有个女生听到了012---No, there is no Rachel Greep. But then this other girl overheard us.
大声嚷嚷 "我就是瑞秋葛皮  我就是"  结果她就进去了012---And she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep, I'm Rachel Greep," and he let her in.
然后你就朝她脸上打了一拳  没有  她已经进去了012---So you hit her in the face? No, she was already in.
不过后面有个肥婆想偷我的伞012---But then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella...
被我一拳揍在脸上012---...so I clocked her.
我真不敢相信012---Ugh. I can't believe this.
我只是想在下班后  跟约书亚相处一下012---All I wanted was just a few hours outside of work to see Joshua...
好让他有机会爱上我012---...so that he could go ahead and start falling in love with me.
菲比012---Aw. Pheebs.
亲爱的  那是你的名字012---Honey, that's your name.
我以为那是我们之间的昵称012---That's short for Phoebe? I thought that's what we called each other.
你穿上裤子了  没错012---Hey, you're wearing pants. That's right.
男人们都到哪里去了  我准备好了 要买醉看脱衣舞012---Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.
才早上9点半  他们那里有自助早餐的012---It's 9:30 in the morning. They got a breakfast buffet.
喂  罗斯  让我跟他说012---Hello? Oh, hey, Ross. Ooh. Let me talk to him.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我能不能  等等  什么012---Can't I just...? Shh. Wait, what?
我的电话  她还嘘我  别吵啦012---It's my phone and she's shush... Shh. Please.
他说什么012---What's he saying?
他跟艾蜜莉在佛蒙特的一个旅馆012---He's with Emily at a bed and breakfast in Vermont.
什么  哦  天哪012---What? Oh, my God.
艾蜜莉是谁  不会吧012---What? Who the hell is Emily? Noooo!!
他们在佛蒙特  怎么会这样012---They're in Vermont? How did this happen?
嗷012---Ow.
他怎么会跟那个巫婆去佛蒙特012---How—How did he end up in Vermont with that awful witch?
也许她没有一直打他吧012---Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.
我们见到她时…012---When we first met her...
她湿透了  连脚都是湿的012---...she was soaking, her feet were wet.
谁能比她更可怜012---Who wouldn't be miserable?
是真的  我给她换了双鞋后  她完全变了个人012---I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
罗斯  快来  外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果012---Ross, come quickly. There's a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard.
我要挂了  外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果012---I gotta go! There's a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard!
他挂了  外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果012---He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
真想不通   她那么讨厌012---I don't get this. She was horrible.
我要去站在那边012---Okay, I'm gonna go stand over there.
你干嘛这么在乎  我才不在乎012---Why do you care so much, anyway? I don't care.
我只是有点儿心烦  我跟约书亚没任何进展012---You know what? I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.
但哪有人刚认识  就跑去佛蒙特鬼混的012---Know what? Still, you do not just meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont.
你和贝瑞一认识就飞到维尔去了012---Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
你能不能偶尔有一次  不要记得这些琐碎小事012---Ugh. You know, could you just for once not remember every little thing?
你知道他什么时候回来么012---So, you know, when's he getting back?
几天后吧  我就知道会这样012---A couple of days. Know what? I knew something like this was gonna happen.
你干什么012---What are you doing?
钱德  你不能让阶段倒流012---Chandler. You can't just go back a phase.
可以  你说的是时间  你不能让时光倒流012---Yes, you can. You're thinking about time. You can't go back in time.
你为什么不  不继续你的第二阶段呢012---Why don't you just...? Why don't you do your phase-two strip-club thing with us?
对呀  来吧  我们可以当男生  不  你们不行012---Yeah, come on, we can be guys. Heh. No, you can't.
怎么了  不就是扮男的嘛  也许我们本来就想当012---Come on, let us be guys. Maybe we wanna be guys.
你们才不会想当男的012---You don't wanna be guys.
男人浑身是毛  而且短命012---You'd be all hairy and you wouldn't live as long.
你  你012---You know, you...
你别再唧唧歪歪了  把运动裤脱了012---Would you just stop being such a wuss and get those off?
跟我们去看裸女跳舞012---And you come with us and watch naked girls dance around.
好012---Okay.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我是乔伊崔比亚尼  我来了 我来了012---Hey, Joey Tribbiani. I'm here, I'm here.
别急  来得及  进度有点落后012---Calm down, we got time. We're running a little late.
准备好了012---All set.
你看  却尔登希斯顿在嚼甘草012---Look at that. Charlton Heston eating a licorice whip.
他很爱嚼甘草  我从没见过他…012---Yeah, he loves them. I've never seen him with...
哇  这儿怎么了  什么东西这么臭012---Whoa. Yeah. What the hell is that? What smells so bad?
是你012---You. Oh.
难怪你会这么想  你知道实际上我怎么想的吗012---I could see why you would think that. But actually, you know who I think it is?
你么  不  是希斯顿012---You? No, no. It's Heston.
什么  就是他身上的臭012---What? The man reeks.
闻起来像是去钓了三天的鱼  现在还嚼甘草012---Smells like he went on a three-day fishing trip and then ate licorice. Ick.
不可能是他呀012---There's no way he smells.
只有他的休息室有浴室012---He's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
真的  浴室  嗯  是哪间012---Really? A shower, huh? And, uh, which room might that be?
门口有写 "希斯顿"的那间012---The one with "Heston" on it.
有意思012---Interesting.
我换了零钞  你要不要去放到她的小裤裤里啊012---Hey. I got some ones. You wanna put them in her panties?
不用了  谢谢  老妈012---No, thanks, Mom.
啊  哦  别  那个012---Oh. No. Um, hi. That, that.
抱歉  你得把烟掐掉  我怀孕了012---You have to put that out because I'm pregnant, so...
也许你和你的孩子应该去别家脱衣舞夜总会了012---Well, maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club.
呵-呵  这不是我的孩子  呵-呵-呵012---Heh, heh. It's not my baby. Heh, heh.
很好  很好012---Very good. Yes. That was so good.
太棒了  我喜欢  很火辣012---Really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
我查过留言  约书亚没打来过012---Well, I just checked our messages, and Joshua didn't call.
我还以为我没去他的夜总会  他会担心呢012---I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club.
更糟的是  罗斯还在佛蒙特风流快活012---Ugh. And you know what makes it worse? Ross is all happy in Vermont.
拜托  你在看脱衣舞啊012---Come on, look where you are.
麻烦给我们每人一杯鸡尾酒  别忘了  我还要个处男012---When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.Remember, virgin for me, please.
记得提醒我  问那个帅哥的名字012---Oh, and don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
拜托012---Oh, come on.
算了  我这就回家给凯西打电话012---You know what? I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
如果有用的话  不  我只是试试012---Well, if you think it'll help. No. That was a test.
再过几小时  我就会烂醉如泥  想打给凯西012---In a couple hours, I'm gonna get drunk and wanna call Kathy...
你们得阻止我呀012---...and you have to stop me.
然后我醉的一塌糊涂了  说不定还会给珍妮丝打电话012---Then I'm gonna be so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice.
你是该打  她好吗012---You should. How is she? Oh!
我想有人肯定会觉得表演还不够过瘾012---I think somebody needs another lap dance.
哈罗  谁在里面012---Hello? Who's in there?
你好吗012---How you doing?
你到底是谁012---Who in the hell are you?
我说寇克道格拉斯  你不会信吧012---Uh, guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kirk Douglas, huh?
把裤子穿上  我好踢你屁股012---Put some pants on, kid, so I can kick your butt.
不  等等  你有所不知012---No, no, no, wait. You don't understand.
我是个演员012---You see, I'm an actor.
乔伊崔比亚尼  今天跟你有一场戏012---Joey Tribbiani. I'm doing a scene with you today.
但是我很臭（演得很烂）012---And, well, I stink.
你有演这部片  对  对012---You're in this picture? Yeah, yeah.
我演不肯跟你合作的警察  因为你的倔脾气012---I'm one of the cops who won't work with you because you're a loose cannon.
总之  我很抱歉  但我真的很臭（演得很烂）012---Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I just... I stink.
乔伊  是吧  对012---Joey, right? Yeah.
每个演员或多或少…012---Every actor, one time or another... Ah.
都会觉得自己很臭012---Every actor thinks he stinks.
连劳伦斯奥立佛  有时也会这么想012---Even Laurence Olivier sometimes thought he stank.
劳勃瑞福甚至都不敢正眼瞧自个儿  不  不  不  你没明白我012---Bob Redford won't even watch himself. No, no, no, you don't understand.
听我说  是  好的012---Listen to me. No... Yeah.
我就不相信任何一个称职的演员012---I don't know one actor worth his salt...
在演艺生涯中都不曾说过 "天哪  我真的太臭了"012---...who one time in his career didn't say, "God, I stink."
我刚拍完一场戏  第一镜  我演得烂透了012---Hell, I just did a scene out there. First take, I stunk the place up.
重要的是你要记住012---But the important thing that you must remember...
不管你认为自己有多臭012---...no matter how badly you think you stink...
永远也别闯到我的更衣室来  用我的淋浴012---...you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower.
听明白了么012---Do you understand me?
是的  是的  我这就  慢着012---Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm very sorry. Wait a minute.
把裤子带走  是012---Take your pants. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
我们在脱衣舞夜总会表现得还好吧  是的  好得很012---So we did okay at the strip club, right? Oh, yeah. That was great.
谢谢你们  你们让最性感的服务生012---Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting...
都想辞职去教三年级了012---...to teach the third grade.
真不敢相信  他居然还没打来012---I can't believe it. He still hasn't called.
谁  约许  不  是约书亚012---Who, Josh? It's "Joshua."
他不喜欢约许  是我不喜欢012---What, he doesn't like "Josh"? No, I don't.
好吧  我要把运动裤换回来012---All right. Well, I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
不要啦  等一下  你说得对  你是对的012---Oh no! wait. You know what? You were right, you were right.
我们扮不好男人  你知道为什么吗012---We really weren't great at being guys. But do you know why?
因为我们是女人012---Because we're girls.
所以呢  你知道女生最擅长什么吗012---Yeah. Do you know what girls are good at?
跳脱衣舞012---Stripping.
不  是倾听  坐下来012---No, listening. Sit.
也许只要你说出来  或许就没事了012---You know, maybe it would really, really help if you would just talk.
是啊  说吧  你的心里在想什么012---Yeah, come on. What's going on in there?
当然了  你想哭也没关系012---And you know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
好了  我要请你们都离开012---Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
别这样嘛  钱德012---Come on, Chandler.
算了  我们试过了  第三阶段没希望了012---Look, forget it. We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.
那些脱衣女郎都野性十足012---Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot...
可我就是没法产生性幻想012---...and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
她们真的很漂亮  不是么012---They really were pretty, weren't they? Oh.
我最喜欢那个救火笼驾驶员  糖糖012---I really liked that fighter pilot one. Oh, Candy?
她火花四射  对啊012---Oh, she was so spunky. Yeah.
要是我想和女人在一起的话…012---You know, I think if I were gonna be with a woman...
我会选蜜雪充那型娇小的012---...it'd be with someone like Michelle.
她简直太  太姣美了012---She was... Oh, she was just so petite.
是么  我到没这么想  如果是我  我会选香姐012---See, I don't know. For me, it would have to be Chantal.
没错  香姐  香姐012---Oh, Chantal, yeah. Chantal.
对啊  哦  天哪…012---You know? Oh, my God. The... Oh.
她的皮肤好光滑呀012---She had the smoothest skin.
我塞钱给她时手擦过她的大腿… 第三阶段012---I mean, when I stuck that dollar bill in her G-string and grazed her thigh...Phase three!
我终于进入第三阶段了012---I just achieved phase three!
真的012---Really?
我现在满脑子想像你们跟她们在一起012---I am totally picturing you with all those women.
那不是第三阶段  不过  我也在场012---That's not phase three. Well, I'm there too.
我们都在一起像个团队吗  别说了  我快疯了012---Well, are we all together? Like in a group? Stop it, you're killing me.
我进入第四阶段了012---I think I just moved on to phase four.
那是什么  我什么关系都不想要了012---Oh, what is that? What is that? Where I don't want a relationship ever.
只想和那些脱衣女郎还有我的朋友们做爱012---I just wanna have sex with strippers and my friends.
来嘛  让我看看你的笑脸012---Come on. Let me see that smile.
我高兴不起来012---I don't wanna.
拜托啦012---Please?
我想去看脱衣舞嘛012---I wanted to go to the strip club.
我知道  你有的是机会  好吧012---I know, You're gonna have plenty of chances, okay?
外面有成千上万的女人等着我呢012---There are thousands of women out there who are just waiting to screw me over.
是的  好吧012---Yeah, all right.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你在佛蒙特玩得好吗012---Hey. Ooh, how was Vermont?
艾蜜莉真是难以置信012---Emily is incredible.
我是说好得无法形容012---I mean, there are no words to describe her.
整个周末就像一场梦012---The whole weekend was like a dream.
还有你  瑞秋  嘿   噢   嘿012---Oh. And you. Rach. Hey. Oh, hey.
你说得太对了  什么012---You were so right. What?
你说我们总算到了一个012---What you said about us finally being in a place...
可以彼此祝福的阶段012---...where we could really be happy for each other.
我是说  我012---Hmm. I mean, I...
我得承认  开始并没有这样想012---I admit, I wasn't quite there. Mm-hm.
因为一想到你和那个叫约许…012---You know, I mean, the thought of you and that Josh guy...
约书亚  约书亚  在夜总会里012---"Joshua." Joshua guy at that club...
跳舞狂欢012---...dancing, having a good time.
那种感觉有点儿012---the thought of it kinda
你懂吗  懂012---You know? Yeah.
但现在  我完全想通了012---But now, but now, I'm totally there.
我现在和你想法一样012---I'm finally where you are.
噢  谢天谢地012---Oh, thank goodness.
谢谢你把艾蜜莉介绍给我012---Yeah, and thank you for Emily.
没什么  很高兴我能帮上忙012---Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help, you know?
也为你高兴012---I'm happy for you.
我才替你开心012---Happy for you.
不  我才替你开心012---Oh, no, happy for you.
好吧  女士们  接下来是这样012---All right, ladies, here's what we're gonna do.
你帮我脱衣服012---You are gonna take off my clothes.
你们两个去拿精油012---You two go get the oils.
你就一直兴奋的大叫012---And you constantly scream at the top of your voice:
"吾王钱德万岁"  "吾王钱德万岁"012---"Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
我  我想跟她在一起  我喜欢她012---No, I wanna be with her. I like her.
没问题  大家随意  大家随意012---Oh, that's fine. Go with your instincts. Go with your instincts.
等等  我要做什么012---Wait, what am I doing again?
专心一点  我随时都会醒来012---Would you please pay attention? I could wake up at any moment.
嗨  我是约书亚  我来接瑞秋012---Hi, I'm Joshua. I'm here to pick up Rachel.
不  不  不  他不是约书亚012---No, no, no, that's not Joshua.
我又没见过他  管他的呢012---What do you want from me? I never met the guy.
不好意思  瑞秋  你得走了  我们还有很多事要忙012---So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay. The rest of us have a lot of work to do.
你干什么012---What are you doing?
好吧  听着  我得醒过来了012---All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
真不敢相信我居然跑来修指甲012---I'm can't believe I'm getting my nails done.
你还说很好玩的012---And you said it was gonna be fun.
是有点好玩012---Which it kind of is.
还有  你说会有别的男人来的  哪有啊012---Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
钱德  那边就有个男的  那是快递012---Chandler, there's a guy right over there. That's a mailman.
他也跑我们公司012---That's our mailman.
嗨  你好啊012---Hi, how are you?
钱德  放心  这样无损于你的男子气概012---Chandler, don't worry. This doesn't make you any less of a guy.
那样会012---That does.
我坐到什么012---What am I sitting on?
我可不敢去想这个女人是抓哪儿  搞断自己指甲的012---Heh. I'd hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
你知道从前谁也戴那种指甲吗  不知道012---Hey, you know who used to have nails like that? No.
我…的…天哪012---Oh, my God.
老友记  第四季  第15集  橄榄球012---Friends S04E05  The One With All The Rugby
乔伊  问个问题  它快让我疯掉了012---Joey, let me ask you a question. This has been driving me crazy.
这个开关是干嘛用的  哦  没用啊012---What does this light switch do? Oh, nothing.
没用的开关  你一点儿都不在意么012---Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
我知道啊  没用012---I know what it did. Nothing.
它存在就一定有功用012---They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something.
你怎么能不在意呢  就像这样012---How can you not care? Like this:
还有一个问题012---Well, here's another question for you.
你知道马桶上银色水龙头把手的功用吗012---Do you know what that little silver knob on the toilet does?
当然知道  冲水  很好012---Sure. It flushes it. Okay, good.
既然你知道  到我们那边来的时候  请你冲一下好吗012---Now, since you know, when you come over, would you mind actually using it?
哈罗  嘿012---Hello. Hey. Aah!
我的天啊  猜猜我们今天遇见谁了012---Oh, my God. Wow. Guess who we ran into today?
珍妮丝  太奇妙了012---Janice. Is this amazing?
你最近好吗  还行  我离婚了012---How have you been? Well, um, I'm divorced.
喔  真的吗012---Wow. Really?
真的  正在靠离婚赡养费过活012---Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
又是这套012---And there it is.
我只是过来打声招呼  嗨  大家好012---I just came up to say hi. Hi.
还有你  亲爱的  我们待会见  好012---You, sweetie, I'll see you later. Okay.
晚上见  好012---Mwah. I'll see you tonight.
再见  再见  再见012---Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
再见  再见  再见012---Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh.
我受不了这个女人012---I can't stand the woman.
什么  我还以为你爱死她了呢012---What? I thought you were crazy about her.
我知道  但是我们相爱之前她就有的那些很烦的小毛病012---I know, you know all those little annoying things she did before we fell in love?
比如她的声音  笑声还有她的性格012---like her voice and her laugh and her personality?
现在  全都回来了  你看012---Well, they're all back, you know.
而且还多了起码九种新的012---And she's picked up like nine new ones.
那你干嘛带她来  你虐待其他人012---So, what are you doing bringing her here? There's people here.
放心  我今晚会搞定012---Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
会才怪  你一直跟她纠缠不清012---You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
这次我不必跟她分手012---Well, I don't have to break up with her this time.
我们又没在一起   我会先发制人012---We're not involved. I'm gonna do a preemptive strike.
我会在开始前就结束掉012---I'm gonna end it with her before it starts.
我的屁股好冰012---My ass is, like, frozen.
塞进冷冻库二十分钟试试看012---Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.
不要不信012---I'm telling you.
你居然敢晚上自己走在路上012---I can't believe you really walk alone here at night.
我是说  纽约的传闻好多012---I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
其实没那么糟的012---No, it's really not that bad.
我一个人的时候也感觉很安全啊012---I mean, I, for one, feel perfectly safe.
救命啊   救命啊  救命啊012---Help! Help! Help!
罗斯  没事  他们是我在英国的朋友012---No, no, no, Ross. Ross, these are friends of mine from home.
连恩  戴文  这是罗斯012---Liam, Devon, this is Ross. Oh. Heh.
老兄  你们好012---Hi, mate. Hey.
你还好吧012---How are you, man? Ha, ha.
喔  哦  我装得不错吧  "救命啊  救命啊"012---Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? I was like, "Help! Help!"
最近怎么样啊012---So how are you?
刚到我就想给你们打电话来着012---I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived...
但是  一直就比较忙了012---...but, um, well, I've been rather busy.
你想想  那次U2演唱会之后我们就没见过了012---Do you realize we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
天哪  噢  是呀  就是012---Ah. Oh, my God, I think you're right.
实际上  应该说是演唱会第二天早上之后就再没见过面012---Well, actually, the last time you and I saw each other was the next morning.
噢  是  连恩012---Ha, ha. Oh, Liam.
噢  是  连恩012---Heh. Oh, Liam.
你们在玩足球吗012---So, what, were you guys playing soccer or something?
或者该叫它012---Or should I call it...
"踢"足球012---..."football"? Uh...
我们在打橄榄球012---We were playing rugby.
明天碰巧在公园里就有球赛  你愿意的话  欢迎参加012---In fact, we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
罗斯打橄榄球  我不敢想象012---Ha, ha. Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
呵  怎么012---Heh. What?
有什么可笑的012---What's so funny about that?
我是说  你是美国人012---Well, I mean, you're American to start with.
你们这里没有橄榄球012---You don't really have rugby here.
我们也是到了1776年  才自由独立012---Heh. Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776 either, so...
那好  说定了  明天2点公园见012---So good then. We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00!
干杯  干杯012---Cheers. Cheers.
天哪  亲爱的  我最喜欢唱歌了012---Oh, boy. I just love to sing.
是的  我知道你喜欢012---Yes, I know that you do.
其他人之所以抱怨012---but I think one of the reasons people were complaining...
他们付钱是来听男演员演唱“老人河”的012---...was because most of the people had paid to hear the actor sing "Old Man River."
哦  瞧瞧我们这对012---Oh, look at us.
谁又能想到  丘比特会光临14街的美甲店呢012---Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails?
好吧  我们得谈一谈012---Okay, we have to talk.
我刚结束一段很认真的恋情012---I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship.
我知道  而我刚结束一段婚姻012---I know. And I'm just getting out of a marriage.
这就叫做三生注定012---I mean, talk about meant to be.
没错  但我觉得进展的太快了012---Right. But I just think this is happening too soon.
什么  太快了  是太慢了012---Oh, too soon, too schmoon.
认命吧  这次我不会放过你的012---Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
我听见了012---I hear you. Ha, ha.
但是  很不幸的  我公司012---But unfortunately, my company...
要把我调到海外012---...is transferring me overseas.
不会吧012---Oh, no.
调去哪里012---Where to?
巴黎  不  不是巴黎012---To Paris? No. No, not Paris.
伦敦  不  不  罗马  维也纳  巴塞罗那012---To London? Oh. No, Rome? Vienna? Ooh, ooh. Barcelona?
好了  你能不能停一会儿别说了012---Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?
也门012---Yemen.
对  没错  我要被调去也门012---That's right. Yes. I'm being transferred to Yemen.
什么时候  我现在还不太清楚012---When? I don't know exactly.
那我只好一直陪伴着钱德宾012---Well, I will just have to soak up every ounce of Chandler Bing...
直到出发的那一刻来临012---...until that moment comes.
但我知道是明天的什么时候012---But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.
好了么  对012---Done? Yep.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
干什么012---What's up?
这个开关快把我逼疯了012---This switch thing has been driving me crazy.
所以我把它关掉  检查每个插座012---So I turned it off and checked every outlet.
有四个不能用  表示其中一个由它控制012---Now, four don't work, which means one of them has to be controlled by the switch.
所以我插上会发出声音的东西012---So I plugged in things in all four outlets that make noise.
也就是说  到时候一打开  顺着声音012---That way, when I turn it on, I just follow the noise...
去找就行了012---...and find out which one it is.
我一定会第一个放弃012---I bet I stopped listening before you did.
其实啊  你可以插电灯012---You know, you also could have used lamps...
然后顺着灯光的亮去找012---...and then followed the light.
是啊  可以呀  我要找声音  好吗012---Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay?
好吧  都准备好了吗012---All right, so everybody ready?
开始了012---Here we go.
有声音  我听到了  在哪里012---There's something. I hear something. Where is it?
是乔伊发出来的012---It's coming from Joey.
天哪  好诡异喔  把他关掉012---Oh, my God. That's so freaky. Turn him off.
在中央球场争球012---With the set scrum in center field.
嘿  嗨012---Oh, hey. Hi.
可以看新闻吗  可能在下雨012---Could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
哦  等一下  我在看体育频道的橄榄球赛012---No, just hold on a sec. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.
有什么大不了的   我也能打012---I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
算了吧  你连看比赛的胆量都没有012---Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
嗨   这不是罗斯么012---Hey there, Ross.
嘿012---Hey.
是珍妮丝012---Janice.
其实  你真的不必帮我收拾行李的012---You know, uh, you really didn't have to help me pack.
你说你出发之前都要打包012---Oh. When you said all you were gonna be doing...
除了帮你收拾行李012---...between now and the time you leave is packing...
我还有什么选择012---..you really didn't leave me much choice.Did you?
我以为会有很多东西  其实没多少012---Well, I thought I did, but I guess I did not.
嗨  怎么回事  收拾行李呀012---Hey. What's going on? Oh, I'm packing.
为明天去也门作准备012---You know, I'm packing because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
谢谢你告诉我啊012---Thanks for telling me.
我是假装要搬去叶门  好摆脱她012---I'm only pretend-moving to Yemen, okay? It's the only way I can get rid of her.
喔  好主意012---Oh. Good one.
也门  听起来还真像个国家012---And Yemen. That actually sounds like a real country.
钱德  进来012---Hey, Chandler, come on.
我教你怎么把内衣裤塞进鞋子012---I'm gonna show you how to roll your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.
这样可以省空间  我那样做是想垫高点012---It's a real space-saver. I do that because it makes me look taller.
钱德  来啊012---Hey, Chandler. Come on.
好012---Okay.
乔伊  咱俩换换吧  不要012---Joey, trade lives with me. Nope.
天哪  瞧瞧这个  罗斯  你居然说你要打橄榄球012---Man, look at this. Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.
这种运动好野蛮  我可以应付  行吗012---Look how brutal this is. Hey, I can handle it, all right?
算了吧  罗斯012---Oh, please, Ross.
你连跟我爸打羽毛球都会受伤012---You got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
那是因为你妈的狗一直  一直盯着我看012---That's because your mom's dog kept looking at me.
好吧  罗斯  看看  看这儿  这叫“并列争球”012---Okay, Ross, look, look, look. Right here, it's called a "scrum," okay?
一堆人挤作一团抢球  不就是个球么012---It's kind of like a huddle. And is a hum kind of like a scruddle?
罗斯  他们会宰了你012---Ross, they're gonna kill you.
你为什么非得玩这个012---Why are you doing this, anyway?
你们应该看看她以前交往的人012---Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with.
他长的活像颗大橄榄球012---I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
不会吧  那他也玩橄榄球么  太搞笑了012---You're kidding. And he plays rugby? That's so funny.
我懂你的意思了012---Oh, I see. You did that. All right.
总之  她觉得我打橄榄球很好笑  是瞎胡闹012---Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was, like, hilarious.
我就是要证明我有多勇猛012---So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am.
对不起  你说得对  你是很猛012---I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're right. You are a tough guy.
你是我认识最猛的古生物学家012---You're the toughest paleontologist I know.
好啦  别开玩笑了012---All right, come on.
罗斯会照顾好自己的  他又不是钱德012---Look, Ross can take care of himself. It's not like he's Chandler.
多谢夸奖012---Thanks.
好了  别替我担心012---Look, don't worry about me.
我会装得很有冲劲  离球越远越好012---I'll just look real energetic and stay away from the ball.
也会学那个人站在圈外012---I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.
哦  哦012---Ooh. Oh!
天啊012---Oh, jeez.
也许旁边正好有只狗在盯着他012---Oh. Well, maybe there was a dog looking at him.
罗斯  罗斯  罗斯012---Okay, Ross, Ross, Ross.
别靠近那个人  那个人和那个人012---You're gonna wanna stay away from that guy and that guy and that one.
天哪  他们都太壮了012---Dude, they're all huge.
又没比我壮多少012---They don't look any bigger than me.
你离你比较近012---That's because you're closer to you.
所以看你自己比较壮012---So you look bigger to you from where you are.
我去跟他们打个招呼012---I'm just gonna go and say hello to the lads.
好  好012---All right. Okay.
嗨012---Hi.
喔012---Oh.
还蛮可爱的012---I kind of liked it.
我知道了  我要变成"红脸罗斯"012---Okay, I know what I've gotta do. I've gotta go Red Ross.
不记得 "红脸罗斯"啊012---You know, Red Ross?
完全不明白你在讲什么012---Totally don't know what you're talking about.
那次我们去看《与狼共舞》012---That time that we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves...
有人插队  我不是就生气了012---...and that one guy cut in front of us, and I just lost it?
破口大骂  脸都涨红了012---Huh? Screamed at him, turned all red.
红脸罗斯012---Red Ross!
不记得了012---No.
等着瞧012---You'll see.
连恩   帮个忙012---Liam, do me a favor.
对罗斯手下留情  他是第一次玩这个012---Tell the lads to go easy on Ross. It's his first time.
完全看不出来呀012---You don't say?
谢了  好012---Thanks. Okay.
祝你好运  亲爱的012---Good luck, babe.
罗斯  罗斯  快来  到这儿来012---Ross. Ross, come on, get in here.
来啊  罗斯012---Ross, come on.
罗斯012---Ross.
罗斯  快进来争球012---Ross, come on, get in the bloody scrum.
罗斯  进去012---Ross, get in.
乔伊012---Joey!
说了你一定不信   约书亚今天来  你猜怎样012---Oh. You are not gonna believe it. Joshua came in today, and guess what happened?
他约你出去  没有012---He asked you out? No.
不过我给他看了一些扣链样本  顺便摸到了他的脉搏012---But I was showing him some cuff links, and I felt his pulse.
聪明012---Saucy.
这是什么  这栋楼的电路图012---What are these? Oh. Electrical plans for the building.
好吧  好吧  我应该要害怕吗012---Okay, okay, okay, should I be scared?
我知道那个开关肯定有用  我到城管处去拿了这个012---I know that switch has gotta do something. So I went to City Hall and I got these.
只花了25美元  排了3小时012---All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
哇  还好知道的人不多012---Wow. If only more people knew.
其实  你真的没必要送我到机场012---You know, you really didn't have to take me to the airport.
喔  别这样  每分每秒都很珍贵012---Oh, please. Every moment is precious.
况且  总得有人在另一辆出租车上帮你看行李吧012---Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with your luggage.
还有  你的朋友好像根本不在乎你要离开似的012---And your friends don't seem to care very much that you're leaving.
我们其实没那么要好012---Well, we're not really that close.
好的  我们  就此告别吧  再见了012---Okay. So I guess this is, uh, you know, goodbye, then.
不  不012---Oh, no, no.
还没到呢  我会一直陪到你上飞机为止012---It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
好  那就请你 "在此等候"012---Okay, well, I guess it's just "wait here," then.
我要一张去也门的假机票012---Hi. I need a fake ticket to Yemen.
一张去叶门的机票  不  不  不012---One ticket to Yemen? Oh, no, no, no.
我只需要一张假机票012---I just need a pretend ticket.
抱歉  先生  我不懂您的意思012---I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.
好吧  假如一个小孩要拿票玩  你会给他什么样的票012---What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
您还有带小孩么012---Are you traveling with a child?
没有012---No.
好吧  她以为我会给你一张信用卡012---Oh. y'know what, She's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card.
其实我拿的是借书证012---But what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
先生  去叶门的机票是2100美元  我们不收借书证012---Uh, sir, a ticket to Yemen is $2100, and we don't take library cards.
怎么了  有什么问题吗012---What's the matter? Is something wrong?
你得留下来吗012---Do you have to stay?
美国运通卡012---American Express?
罗斯012---Ross!
啊  哦012---Oh. Ah.
他们怎么这样  我明明叫他们手下留情的012---I can't believe they're doing that to him. I told them to go easy on him.
你不要介意  不过  你有时候说话口音太重012---No offense, but sometimes it's hard to understand you...
让人很难听懂012---...you know, with the accent, so...
才上半场结束  还有的他受呢012---That's just halftime. There's more of this. Oh.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿012---Hey.
你们看到了吗  我挺强的吧  好过瘾的球赛012---Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game.
没错  帮个忙  去帮我拿水012---Right. Do me a favor? Grab me a bottle of water?
好  谢了012---Yeah. Thanks.
我觉得我快死了  真的  真可怜012---I think I'm dying. I really do. Oh, poor baby.
告诉我儿子我爱他012---Tell my son that I love him.
太好了  我还要玩得更爽一些012---Oh, excellent. Okay, gotta have some more fun.
罗斯  你快被整死了012---Ross, they are killing you out there.
不会的  她说得对  你不能再打了012---That's not true. She's right. You have to stop.
什么 不  不  不行  我是红脸罗斯012---What? No. No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross.
算了吧  你再上场会变成屎面罗斯012---Dude, you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross.
那我不管  我绝不退场  我要打完全场012---I don't care. I am not quitting. I am gonna finish this game.
好  如果你一定要坚持打  至少得让我帮帮你012---All right. If you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
天啊  不  这不是女人玩的  那些人什么都抢012---God, no. That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
我不是要上场012---That's not what I was saying.
我只是知道怎样让别人受伤012---I just might know a few things that could help you inflict some pain.
我喜欢  真的吗  听清楚了012---I like that. Yeah? Listen closely.
听好  戴文的脚踝很弱012---Devon has got a weak ankle. Huh?
你轻轻一踢  他就不敢上前了012---One swift kick and he'll back off.
好  踢脚踝  记下了012---All right, bad ankle. Got it.
那个留落腮胡的大个子012---And that big bloke with the beard? Uh-huh.
屁股受过伤012---He's got a trick hip. Ha, ha.
还有  那边的大卫  我听说他没戴护膝012---Yeah. And David over there, I heard that he doesn't wear a cup.
真的吗  我清楚了  一个屁股受过伤  一个没有护膝  好012---Real...? I could use that. Trick hip, no cup. Okay, okay.
还有  连恩的膝盖有伤012---And Liam. Liam's got bad knees.
你看准了一踢上去  一撞就倒012---You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
但是连恩跟我同队012---But Liam's on my team.
我不管   你只管对付他们   好  对付他们012---I don't care. You just get him. Go get him.
好  我要回场上了012---Okay. I am going back in.
赤面罗斯012---Red Ross. Yeah.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
这些是什么012---What are these?
我画了一些画挂起来012---Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up.
好让客厅看起来更漂亮  不是么  你不觉得吗012---I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do, don't you think?
别撕  别撕  别撕012---Aah! No, no, don't, don't.
哦012---Oh!
我知道那里没有洞  我只是很喜欢那幅画012---I know that there's no hole there. I just really like that picture.
天哪   你看看012---Oh, my God. Look at this.
可是  开关后面有线   一定是连到某个地方012---But there is a wire back there. That switch is connected to something.
我不管   你脑子短路了吧012---I don't care. The wires have come loose in your head.
我只是觉得顺着电线找找  就能找出它的功用012---I thought if I could follow the wire, I could find out what it did.
找到了吗  没有012---And did you? No.
到了那层夹板后就断了012---It disappears back behind that baseboard.
我想了一下  觉得线肯定往楼下走了012---For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
结果没有012---But it didn't.
跟楼下邻居打声招呼吧  天啊012---Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis. Oh, my God.
你好  亲爱的  你好啊  Chatracus夫人012---Hello, darling. Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.
你确定不去看医生吗012---Are you sure you don't wanna go see a doctor?
不用了  这只会让我更沮丧012---Oh, no, that'll just bring me down.
太棒了  我很厉害  今天我太棒了012---This was great. I mean, I was great. This was a great day.
而且  我要请大家喝咖徘012---You know what? I'm buying everyone coffee.
帮我拿皮夹  在我的口袋里012---Someone just grab my wallet. It's in my pocket.
好  没叫你012---Yeah, sure. No, not you.
好012---Okay.
你的眼睛还有些肿  我去拿冰块012---Look, your eye's still popping out a little. I'm gonna go get some ice.
好  冰块  我太想要冰块了012---Okay. Ooh, ice, yeah. I'm so in the mood for ice.
你刚才好神勇012---You were amazing out there. Oh.
真的  对吧  天啊012---I kind of was, wasn't I? Oh, my God.
我让一个壮我两倍的人哭了012---I made a man twice my size cry.
上一次是四岁  我用石头洗我爸的保时捷012---I mean, I haven't done that since I was 4 and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
你真的打得很过瘾   对不对012---You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?
开玩笑  你想想看  我干掉三个大块头012---Please, are you kidding? I hurt three huge men.
还让一个人流鼻血012---I gave a guy a bloody nose.
这没什么好得意的  不过…012---I mean, I'm not proud of it...
我真的好得意012---...but I really am.
都是因为你012---And it's all because of you.
完美无瑕的你  我看你是得了脑震荡了012---Yeah. Wonderful, amazing you. I think you've got a concussion.
不  我是说真的  谢谢你012---No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
不客气012---You're welcome.
对不起  弄疼你了吧  痛也值得012---I'm sorry. Did that hurt you? It's worth the pain.
其实不值得  要不  还是算了吧012---You know what? You know what? It's not.
飞往也门的664号航班即将起飞012---This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
好吧  看来我该走了012---Well, I guess I gotta go.
我的宾淇淋012---Oh. My Bing-a-ling.
我会等你的012---I'll wait for you.
你知道你要去多久吗012---Do you even know how long you're gonna be gone?
这个么  可能得等到我们发现替代石油燃料的新能源了012---Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
好吧  我会每天给你写信的012---Oh. Well, I'll write you every day.
也门  也门路15号012---15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
好  再见012---Okay. Goodbye.
再见012---Goodbye.
钱德  不是我012---Chandler? No.
钱德012---Chandler.
珍妮丝  原来你在这  你在这  我得跟你做最后吻别012---Janice. There you are. There you are. I had to have one last kiss.
你说你看见  我一上机你就走的012---And also, also, you said you were gonna leave right after I got on the plane.
不  不  我想看着你起飞012---No. No. I wanna see you take off.
我想我真得去也门了012---Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen.
我要去也门了012---I'm going to Yemen.
到了也门  我可以住你家吗012---When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
算了吧  管理员不知道它的作用012---All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did.
一小时两百块的电工  也不晓得它的作用012---The $200-an-hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did.
我被狠狠电到过七次012---I've had seven pretty serious shocks.
我放弃了  谢天谢地012---I officially give up. Thank God.
看来乔伊说得对012---I guess Joey was right.
它的确没有用012---It does nothing.
看见了吧012---See?
我在控制它  我能控制电视012---I'm doing it. I am totally doing it.
超能力没了012---I lost it.
怎么了012---What is it?
没什么  我不知道要吃什么012---Nothing. I can't find anything that I want to eat.
吃什么都会让我恶心012---Everything makes me nauseous.
我告诉你  怀孕可不像吃蛋糕那么简单  哇啊  蛋糕012---I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake. Oh, cake.
不行012---No.
真可怜  天啊012---Aw, honey, I'm sorry. God.
什么香味  是浴室传出来的012---Ooh, what is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom.
你倒是多了些怪癖012---Wow, pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
是我  菲比012---Yeah. It's me. It's Phoebe.
听着  这里有我想吃的东西  什么012---Listen, there's something in here I want to eat. What?
什么味道这么香012---What smells so good?
是洗发香波吗  是石榴香味012---Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
不是012---No.
等下  等等012---Ugh. Oh, wait, wait.
是我的红肠三明治吗012---Is it my bologna sandwich?
对  对  没错012---Yes, yes, yes.
这孩子居然想吃红肠  可能他想让我吃肉012---I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna. The baby wants me to eat meat.
我不能吃肉  等等012---I can't eat meat. Uh, wait, wait.
也许是腌黄瓜012---Maybe it's the pickle.
老友记  第四季  第16集  假派对012---Friends S04E16  The One With The Fake Party
你在写什么012---What are you writing?
约书亚明天要来012---Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow...
因为我没胆儿约他出来012---...and since I don't have the guts to ask him out...
所以我打算卖他件衣服   然后把这纸条塞进口袋里012---...I'm gonna sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
是吗  是012---Oh, yeah? Oh.
"约书亚  有空打电话给我  你这样的男人…012---"Joshua, give me a call sometime. Guys like you...
…永不过时"012---...never go out of style."
你都扔了哪些话啊012---What did you throw away?
伙计们  嗨  你们干什么去了012---Hi, guys. Hey, what have you guys been up to?
我们去Cupert-Hewitt博物馆  看维多利亚时期门把展012---Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs at the Cooper-Hewitt museum.
没带-我012---Without me?
是我舅舅拖我们去的   结果很有意思012---My uncle dragged us there, but actually it turned out to be interesting.
是啊  那些门把很华丽012---Yeah. They were so ornate and beautiful.
我是说  你们看012---I mean, look at that.
我不知道英国的国情012---I don't know how museums work in England...
但这里  不能顺手牵羊012---...but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
这是礼品部的012---I, uh... I got it from the gift shop.
那里没什么防盗措施012---They have really lax security there.
开个玩笑012---It's a joke.
拜012---Bye.
我该走了  再见  我会想你们的  拜拜012---Right, I've got to be off. I'll see you. Bye-bye, then.
再见012---Bye.
看起来你们相处得很愉快嘛012---Wow. Hey, you guys seem to be having a good time.
对啊  她人很棒   而且很有趣012---Oh, yeah, she is amazing, and she's so much fun.
还有  你知道吗  跟她在一起时  我也相当有趣012---And you know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun.
我甚至报名学开直升机012---I even signed up for helicopter classes.
她过两天就走了  我其实不用这样012---She's leaving in two days. I don't have to do it.
过两天  你一定很失落吧  是啊012---Aw, two days? You must be bummed. Yeah.
她非回伦敦不可012---She's got to go back to London.
但你知道吗  我一开始就有心理准备012---But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start.
我们都知道我们彼此只有这两星期  仅此而已012---We both knew we had two weeks together and then that's it, you know?
我的每段恋情也都是这样012---Hey, that's what all my relationships are like.
对  但是罗斯他们是"双方"都知道  只有两星期而已012---Yes, but in Ross' case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
菲比  嗨012---Pheebs, hey.
宝宝  好啊  好啦  我知道012---Hello, hello. Yeah, I know. Yeah.
这孩子就喜欢肉012---So the baby is totally craving meat.
下午我想用素汉堡骗骗他012---This afternoon, I tried tricking it.
我做了个素汉堡  就是让他以为他吃到肉了012---I made it a soy burger so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.
然后  我又恶心了012---You know? And I got nauseous.
也许是因为素汉堡太难吃012---Well, maybe that's because soy burgers suck.
怀孕吃东西真难啊012---Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.
但你有一种孕妇的光彩012---Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant-lady glow.
真好听  你要是吐一个早上也会红光满面的012---Oh, that's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
这是你想要的风衣012---Okay. Uh, here's that trench coat you wanted.
太好了012---Oh, great. Great.
很舒服012---Wow, yeah, it's comfortable. Yeah.
这个可以用来装变态012---Man, you could really flash somebody in this thing.
不行  出了店门012---Ha, ha. They don't want you to put your hands in the pockets...
才能把手放进口袋里012---...until you are out of the store.
为什么012---Why not?
因为012---Well, because
有很多人012---we get a lot of
你知道  装变态毁了好多人012---You know, they ruin it for everybody.
我知道012---I know.
你知道  我昨晚穿那件喀什米尔毛衣去约会012---You know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
我离婚后第1次的约会012---Oh. It was the first date since the divorce.
恭喜  你爱她吗012---Well, congratulations. So do you love her?
她还不错  不过我也发现012---No, no, no. She's nice, but, you know, it made me realize...
我还没有心情约会  你明白012---...I'm just not ready to be dating, you know?
对012---Huh.
这样012---Well, uh...
真有意思012---That's, uh... That's interesting.
那是什么  就是个防盗磁条012---What was that? Oh, that's just an antitheft device.
那这是什么012---Then what's this?
那个你也需要  因为很明显  贼会把它撕掉012---Well, you need that too, because obviously a thief could just tear this up.
听着  今天晚上有个派对012---Listen, we have to have a party tonight.
其实是5分钟后开始  所以大家都要取消别的计划012---We have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
你说什么  是啊  怎么回事012---What? Yeah, what's going on?
我们要帮艾蜜莉搞个惊喜告别晚会012---We have to have a surprise bon-voyage party for Emily.
其实是为了约书亚012---But it's actually for Joshua.
他说他还没有心情约会012---Look, he said he's not ready to date.
所以我得邀请他参加派对  才能在工作之外见到他012---So I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside work.
现在我创造了个绝好的机会来勾引他012---And now I have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.
同样我也有机会见到约书亚  很想当面警告他012---Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him...
但是艾蜜莉和我不能参加  好吗012---...Emily and I aren't gonna be here, all right?
她会来说声再见012---She's gonna come by first to say goodbye.
我今晚还有个完整的计划  对不起  没戏唱了012---And then I've got a whole special evening planned. So sorry. No party.
有人吗  惊喜012---Hello? Surprise!
惊喜  惊喜012---Surprise!
从来没有人给我办过惊喜派对012---No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before.
这都是罗斯的主意012---Well, it was all Ross' idea.
你真好012---You're so sweet.
我真的很惊喜啊012---And I'm so surprised.
你真的没料到012---You really didn't know?
约书亚在那边  你怎么在这边012---Why are you over here if Joshua's all the way over there?
啊  因为我想玩玩欲擒故纵012---Uh, because I'm trying to play hard-to-get.
快  快点他看过来了  说句好笑的话012---Oh, quick. He's looking over here. Say something funny.
比如012---Like what? Ha-ha-ha.
什么事这么好笑012---What's so funny?
我说了个 "比如"012---I said, "Like what?"
真深奥012---Now that's a thinker.
你知道吗  玩欲擒故纵不好使啊012---Okay, you know what? This playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.
把樱桃给我  好…012---Uh, hand me those cherries. Okay.
好012---Okay.
嗨012---Hi. Hey.
要吃樱桃吗  不要  谢谢012---Care for a cherry? No, thanks.
你知道吗  我可以用舌头把樱桃梗打结012---You know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
你还好吗012---You okay?
没事吧012---You all right?
我们差不多得赶快走了012---So we should probably get going soon.
但是派对才刚刚开始啊012---Oh, but the party's only just getting started.
我们得在15分钟内   赶去"四季" 喝酒012---Yeah, but we have to be at The Four Seasons for drinks in, oh, 15 minutes.
然后再去广场饭店吃晚饭012---And then, uh, you know, then the Plaza for dinner.
那你为什么还在同一时间还办派对啊012---So why did you plan a party at the same time?
不  不  不是的012---No, no, no. Ha, ha.
其实  美国的惊喜派对时间都很短012---Actually, American surprise parties are very short.
一般都是 "惊喜"   然后就 "我好惊喜  再见"012---It's usually, "Surprise!" Then, "Oh, my God, I'm so surprised. Goodbye."
但是我觉得好好玩012---Ross, I'm having such a great time.
你妹说你以前会假扮成老太太012---Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dressed up like old ladies...
举办 "虚拟世界" 茶会012---...and host make-believe tea parties.
摩妮卡说的  是吧012---Monica said that, did she?
好赞  你接下来要放什么012---Oh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
放点蒜味肉肠  好棒012---A little salami. Ooh, yeah. Yeah.
那蒜味肉肠上面呢012---Then, um, what goes on top of the salami?
燻牛肉  太赞了012---Pastrami. Oh, yeah.
你真是天才012---You're a genius.
能帮我拉下拉链吗012---Can someone give me a hand with the zipper.
往上拉012---Up.
你换衣服  对  我需要我的幸运裙012---You changed? Yeah, I just needed my lucky dress.
幸运是指露更多乳沟  对我管用012---And "lucky" means "more cleavage"? Does for me.
你们看他啊  这么可爱012---Oh, God, look at him. He's so cute.
我真想过去  抓着他  然后亲他012---I just want to go over there and grab him and kiss him.
我怎么才能又亲他  又不让他知道我喜欢他012---How could I kiss him without letting him know that I like him?
我知道怎么能办到  脱胸罩012---Hey, I know how you can get him. Take off your bra.
什么012---What?
在 "浑身是劲" 里   是"闪舞"里012---There was a scene in Footloose... Flashdance.
对  那个水电女工  她是焊接工012---Yeah, yeah. Yeah, with that plumber girl? She was a welder.
你在电影里吗012---Were you, like, in the movie?
反正  她从衬衫里脱掉了胸罩012---Anyway, she takes off her bra under the shirt...
然后从袖子里拉了出来012---...and pulls it out the sleeve.
看着非常性感  还很有品位012---Very sexy. And classy.
不然如果你想亲他  可以用槲寄生树（圣诞节传统  在槲寄生树下接吻）012---Or if you wanna kiss him, um, you could use mistletoe.
现在不是圣诞节012---It's not Christmas.
转瓶子  他不是小孩子了012---Or spin the bottle. And he's not 11.
谢谢你们真用心  想的真周到012---Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
你们要走了012---You're leaving?
对  我们还有别的事  我想我也要走了012---Yes, we have something we have to get to. Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna take off too.
先别走  留下来  你们得留下012---No, you guys, you can't leave yet. You have to stay.
我们还准备了重头戏012---We've got the whole big thing planned.
什么重头戏012---What big thing?
像这样这么转瓶子012---So, Spin-The-Bottle works like this.
我转瓶子012---I spin the bottle.
指向阿甘  我就要亲阿甘012---Lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther.
就这样012---All right.
谁要先012---Who wants to go first?
我先012---I'll go.
欢迎来到美国012---Welcome to America.
好012---All right.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
连续两次  来个舌吻吧012---Oh, my gosh. Two in a row. You gotta use your tongues now.
再来012---All right.
这概率  太巧了012---What are the odds? What are the odds?
够了  我们012---Okay, that's enough, you know. Ha, ha.
让别人玩吧012---Let's let someone else play.
你不想玩  干嘛来参加派对啊012---Hey, if you didn't want to play, then why'd you come to the party?
好了  该我了012---Okay, my turn.
是你012---Oh! Look at that.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
天哪  宝宝踢我了012---Oh, my God. The baby just kicked.
没事  他踢了一次  还会踢第二次012---It's okay, it's okay. If it kicked once, it'll kick again.
好吧  大家要记住刚才坐的位置012---All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
有虫012---It was a bug.
不管我多想吃012---It doesn't matter how much I'm craving it.
你知道我为什么不吃肉  因为这是冷血谋杀012---You know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's cold-blooded murder.
好012---Okay.
我的三明治上有菲比012---There's a Phoebe on my sandwich.
菲比  你干什么012---Phoebe, what are you doing?
我忍不住012---I can't help it.
我要吃肉  孩子要吃肉012---I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
你知道和别人交往012---You know how when you're dating someone...
绝对不能欺骗她们  除非遇见特惹火的012---..and you don't want to cheat on them unless it's with someone really hot?
那当然  明白  这就对了012---Yeah, totally. All right, okay.
吃肉也一样012---Well, this is the same kind of deal.
如果你想犯错误012---If you're gonna do something wrong...
就要错得漂亮012---...do it right.
感觉好多了吗012---Feel better?
对  但要付出多大代价012---Yeah, but at what cost?
六个月   一天三顿肉012---Six more months, three meals a day?
我会吃掉几百万头牛012---I'm gonna eat like, you know, millions of cows.
要是我帮你扯平  肉方面012---Hey, what if I said I could even things out for you, meat-wise?
什么  我很会吃肉  对吧012---What? Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?
要是在孩子出生前012---Yeah. But suppose, until the baby's born...
我戒吃肉012---...I laid off it.
就不会多死动物   你是相当于在吃我的那份012---No extra animals would die. You'd just be eating my animals.
你居然愿意为我这么做012---Joey, I can't believe you'd do that for me.
当然愿意   我也可以吃素012---Absolutely. I could be a vegetarian.
啤酒里没有肉  对吧012---There's no meat in beer, right?
不要开胃菜  马上买单012---Okay, we can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers...
还赶得上预定时间012---...and ask for our check right away.
现在不能走  瑞秋要表演012---We can't go now. Looks like Rachel is going to put on a skit.
我的天哪  你疯了吗012---Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind?
不  不  我终于想通了012---No, no, no. I am finally thinking clearly.
我的幸运裙没发挥作用012---My lucky dress wasn't working out too well for me.
但这宝贝大学四年里  从没失手过012---But for four years, this baby never missed.
瑞秋  等等  我不能让你…012---Rachel, wait, I can't let...
其实  我也想看看会发生什么012---Actually, I kind of want to see what happens.

我这拉拉队长怎么样012---Okay. That's me as a cheerleader. Ta-da!
你没事吧  有颗牙齿松了012---You all right? I just loosened a tooth.
小意思  我有牙医012---It's no big deal. I have a dentist, you know?
我敷点冰块  失陪012---I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
我做得怎么样  怎么样  我认为你成功了012---What do I do now? What do I do now? I think you're done.
该脱胸罩了012---Okay, time to take off the bra.
刚才表演很精彩012---Uh, that was really great.
但我真得走了012---But I got to take off, actually.
脱胸罩012---Take the bra off.

今晚真的很开心的012---So this was really fun.
是啊  很开心012---Oh, yeah, it was real fun.
你知道  这胸罩012---You know, this bra...
真的很不舒服012---...is really bothering me.
这里曾经是我的睡房012---You know, this used to be my bedroom.
嗯012---Yeah.
有很多回忆  很多很多回忆012---A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.
要是墙壁能说话  你知道  它们会说什么吗012---If these walls could talk, you know what they'd say?
"想回忆往事吗"012---"Want to hear some memories?"
你需要帮忙吗012---Need a...? Need a little hand there?
不  不用  没问题  我应付的了012---Oh, no, no, no. No, I got this all under control.
可你看起来不像能应付的了012---You really don't seem like you do.
算了啦   真是012---God. Forget it! Oh, this is...
事情本来不该这样的012---This is not how this was supposed to happen.
那应该怎样啊012---What was supposed to happen?
我说的时候你能不看我吗012---Can you not look at me when I say this?
我以为只要能把你找来012---I thought that if I could get you here...
就可以勾引你012---...I could seduce you.
我上班不穿西装012---Uh, I don't wear suits to work...
却从你那买了六套012---...and I bought six of them from you.
抱歉啊   我以为你有需要012---Well, I'm sorry. I thought you needed them.
我意思是  我不停地来找你  是因为我想见你012---My point is, I kept coming back because I wanted to see you.
为什么  因为我喜欢你012---Why? Because I like you.
你喜欢我012---You like me?
是啊012---Yeah.
你漂亮  聪明又成熟012---I mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.
这些印象不都是来自今晚012---A lot of this isn't, you know, based on tonight.
但是你喜欢我012---But you like me?
天啊  这段日子以来  我们竟然互相喜欢012---Oh, my God. I can't believe this. All this time, I liked you and you liked me.
啊012---Oh!
但是  不要说 "但是"012---But... No don't say "but."
"但是" 都没好事  停在 "我们互相喜欢"就好012---"But" is never good. Let's leave it at "I like you and you like me."
好012---Okay, uh...
然而  那是好听的 "但是"012---However... No, that's a fancy "but."
我刚结束我的婚姻012---My marriage, like, just ended.
我还没心情跟别人交往012---And I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
但是…012---But...
对不起  我需要点时间012---I'm sorry. I just need a little time.
好啊012---Okay.
你在这里  我刚才在找你012---Oh, there you are. I was looking for you before.
约书亚走了  你和艾蜜莉也可以走了012---Joshua's gone, so you and Emily are free to go.
无所谓012---It's okay.
她还在里面享受这场假派对呢012---She's still in there enjoying her fake party.
现在我要做什么也来不及了012---And, uh, it's too late to do any of the stuff I had planned, so...
罗斯012---Ross.
抱歉  我毁了你美好的夜晚012---I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
是啊012---Ahem. Yeah.
如果这让你好受点  我出了个大丑012---Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool of myself.
你有没有高兴点012---Helps a little.
有地方让悲惨的衰仔坐一坐吗012---Is there a room on that step for a pathetic loser?
过来  坐吧012---Yeah, have a seat.
对不起012---I'm so sorry.
没关系012---It's okay.
反正只是一段两星期的恋情012---I mean, it was just a two-week thing anyway.
我只是不想以这样的方式结束  你知道012---I just didn't want it to end this way, you know.
也许你不想结束呢012---Or maybe you didn't want it to end?
什么意思012---What do you mean?
看起来你很喜欢她012---You seem to really like her.
没错  真的是012---Yeah, I really do.
但我能做什么呢012---Yeah, but what am I gonna do?
我们说好了只在一起两个星期012---We both agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.
你知道  双方没有责任012---You know? No commitment.
罗斯012---Ross?
那个女孩整晚都跟你的朋友聊天012---That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends...
吵着要听你的事012---...asking to hear stories about you...
还拿摩妮卡的相册来看012---...looking through Monica's photo albums.
我意思是  你不会为了两周的交往而做这些012---I mean, you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
你这么想012---You think?
是的  到她上飞机前你还有14个小时012---You've got, like, 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
你却坐在走廊上012---And you're sitting here in a hallway...
陪一个28岁  嘴肿起来的啦啦队长012---...with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
你说得对012---Hey, you're right. Yeah.
谢了012---Thanks.
哪本相簿012---What photo album was it?
不知道   是你和一群白化病孩子012---I don't know. It was you and a bunch of albino kids.
天啊  他们不是白化病012---Oh, my God. Those weren't albino kids.
那是电脑夏令营啦012---That was computer camp. Rach.
嗨   嗨012---Hey. Hey.

所有我刚才说的没心情的话012---All those things I said about not being ready...
都不是真的  不  都是真的012---They're not true? No, they're all true.
哦012---Oh.
但是…012---But...
哦012---Oh.
我喜欢这个 "但是"012---Oh, I love that "but."

赞012---Yeah.
你知道什么跟它最配  腌牛肉012---Hey, you know what goes good with that? Mm-hm. Corned beef.

我会先下手012---Not if I get there first.
天哪012---Oh, man.
谁啊  崔格在通洗澡间的下水道012---What is that? Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
这是什么鬼东西012---What in the name of hell?
可能他找到了你的夹脚拖鞋012---Maybe he found your flip-flop.
嘿  哇012---Hey. Whoa.
这是成人A片吗012---Is this porn?
我怎么弄的  我一定是按了哪个键了012---What did I do? I must have hit something on the remote.
我们有付钱吗012---Do we pay for this?
没有  我们连第四台有线的都没付012---No, we didn't even pay our cable bill.
也许这是他们的处罚方式012---Maybe this is how they punish us.
也许我们应该欠电话费  免费色情电话012---Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill. Free phone sex.
也许我们还应该欠煤气费012---Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.
哇  那女的真是一丝不挂012---Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
乔伊不知道按了什么键  它就冒出来了012---Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just came on.
我有一次也按到过  就是在搜索频道  然后啪出来了012---It happened to me once. I was flipping through the channels and, bam.
就像捡到钱一样爽   印有裸体人的钱012---It was like finding money. Finding money with naked people on it.
后来我错误地关掉了电视012---Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV.
就再也找不回来了012---I never got it back again.
我好伤心012---And I'm sad.

对  所以谁也不许碰遥控器  还有电视012---Yeah, so no one touches the remote, and no one touches the TV.
也不许碰电视周围的空气012---And no one touches the air around the TV.
就像有一个A片保护罩012---Imagine a protective porn bubble, if you will.
起码我也要静音  不要  不要012---I'm at least going to mute it. No, no, no.
A片还在  还好012---We still have porn. Yeah.

好了012---Okay.
我快不行了  实在不能再拖着按摩桌到处跑了012---I'm getting too pregnant for this... Lugging around a stupid massage table.
我得找个桌子小点的工作012---I have to find a job where I carry a smaller table.
或是不需要桌子的工作012---Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
你是说像医生吗012---You mean, like a doctor?
菲比  你挡到A片了啦  让开啊012---Pheebs, you're blocking the porn. Look out.
天啊012---Oh, my.

艾蜜莉去机场了012---So, uh, Emily just went to the airport.
你怎么不送她去012---Aw. Why didn't you take her?
她舅舅本来就打算送她012---Ehh, her uncle had planned on doing it.

你一定很难受  不过  隔壁有免费的A片看012---You must feel horrible. Hey, the guys have free porn.
不了012---No.
高兴点  你们会再见面的  对吗012---Hey, cheer up. You're gonna see her again, right?
是这样的  我就是不知道012---Well, that's the thing. I don't know.
每次我提起她就说012---I mean, whenever I brought it up with her, she said:
"这样就很棒啊  何必谈到未来012---"This is so fantastic. Why do we have to talk about the future?
就享受现在多好"   别学英国腔012---Let's enjoy..." Don't do the accent.
你得再见她一次012---You've got to see her again.
干嘛这么在意012---Why do you care?
因为012---Because.
你可以实现我的幻想012---You could get to live out my fantasy.
你对艾蜜莉有幻想012---You've had fantasies about Emily?
不是  就是  那个幻想嘛012---No. You know, the fantasy.
认识异国他乡的人012---Meet someone from a strange land...
疯狂坠入爱河  然后共度余生012---...fall madly in love and spend the rest of your lives together.
所以  你国中时012---Is that why, in junior high...
老是跟那个乌克兰的男生混012---...you were the only one who hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
对  还有他妈妈总是把酸奶油抹在所有吃的上012---Yeah, that, but plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything.
你爱她吗012---Do you love her?
我们说好只在一起两星期012---We said it was only gonna be two weeks, you know?
你爱她012---You love her.
什么才是爱012---What is love, really?
我就知道你爱她012---I knew you loved her.
你得去机场告诉她012---You need to go to the airport and tell her.
你会在她登机前追上她012---You're probably gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate.
你会叫她的名字  大声喊 "我爱你"012---You're gonna call out her name and yell, "I love you."
她会说  "我也爱你"012---She's gonna say, "I love you too."
然后你们会有最深情的一吻012---Then you guys are gonna have the most amazing kiss.
登机门前掌声如雷012---Everyone at the gate will applaud.
我是很会接吻的012---I am a good kisser.
然后你们钻进驾驶舱012---Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.
热血澎湃012---Things will start to heat up.
再后来一个空姐进来012---And then a stewardess comes in...
我看成人A片太多了012---I've been watching too much porn.
那是心跳吗  没错012---Is that the heartbeat? That's it.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
太酷了012---Oh, wow. This is so cool.
我们谈过多胞胎的可能吗012---Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
先搞定这一胎012---Why don't we just take care of this one?
我要是想再怀孕   我会留住你的名片012---And should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
不是  我听到了三个不同的心跳音012---No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
三个  你们还担心我一个都怀不上呢012---Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one.
医生经常犯错012---Doctors are wrong all the time. Well...
你确定有三个012---Well, so are you sure that there are three?
绝对的  天哪012---Definitely. Oh, my God.

再过几个月012---So in a few months...
就会有三个孩子在我肚子里转悠012---...I'm gonna have three full-grown babies just walking around inside me?
然后他们就像012---Oh, oh. And it's gonna be like one of those log rides...
连发炮一样冲出来012---...when they just come shooting out.
其实  生三个跟生一个一样012---Giving birth to three babies is not that different than giving birth to one.
你懂什么啊012---What do you know?
菲比  嗨012---Phoebe. Oh! Hi.
产检结果怎样012---So how'd it go at the doctor's?
是这样的012---Oh, well, okay. Hey.
你知道  你走在街上看见012---You know how, when you're, um, walking down the street...
看见三个人并排走012---...and you see three people in a row.
你会说  "真好"012---And you say "Oh, that's nice."
没错012---Yes. Okay.

你们高兴就好  我还怕你们会吓坏了012---Oh, God. I'm so glad you guys are happy. I was so afraid you we're gonna be freaked.
为什么要吓坏呢012---Oh. Why would we be freaked?
可能因为三个养起来更累也更花钱012---No, because maybe it's harder to raise them and the added expense. Ugh!
也对012---Oh. Right.
别停   继续高兴  继续高兴012---No, back to happy. Back to happy!
不  没问题的012---No, no, no. It's gonna be fine...

而且我很喜欢冷冻库012---And I love refrigerators. Yeah.
你不能放弃梦想012---You can't give up on your dream. Ugh.

不客气   她说什么012---You're totally welcome. What'd she say?
她说  "谢谢"012---She said, "Thank you."
我说  "我爱你"012---I said, "I love you."
她说  "谢谢"012---And she said, "Thank you."
不对啊  等一下  你说了你爱她012---Oh, wait. Did you say you love her?
你想让她怎么做012---Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?
我现在怎么办012---What do I do now?
欲擒故纵  疏远她012---You play hard-to-get.
她已经在伦敦了012---She already lives in London.
那你就去东京012---So you go to Tokyo.
好吧  算了  别想了012---All right, look, forget it.
别想了  你说你爱她   就已经完了012---Okay, forget it. You told her you love her. It's over.
没完  你才完了呢012---It is not over. You're over.
什么012---What?
你懂的012---You know.
好012---Okay.
说得好012---Good one.
还没完  因为她会给你打电话  告诉你她爱你012---It's not over because she's gonna call you and tell you she loves you.
而她先前不说原因是  她感觉太强烈了  她害怕012---The reason why she couldn't is because her feelings were so strong that it scared her.
你现在就回家  等她电话012---Now, you go home and you wait for her call.
她很可能会从飞机上打  快去  走啊012---She could be calling you from the plane. Come on, go.
要是她没打来  那就真的完了012---Okay, okay. But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over.
不  等等  除非  最后我打给她  问问她怎么样了012---No, wait, wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, you know, to see what's going on...
然后她说会再打给我  结果没打012---...and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't.
那就真的  结束了012---Then it's over.
够坚强012---Way to be strong, man.

我们已经看了2小时的进进出出了012---We spent the last two hours watching In and Out and In Again.
那  为什么不关掉了012---Well, so why don't you just turn it off?
那我们不就成了关掉免费A片的白痴了012---Because then we'd be the guys who turned off free porn.
太好了  你们都在012---Oh, good, you're here.
嗨012---Hey.
你手上拿的什么012---What you got there?

难道你不讨厌用普通切肉刀012---Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can...
去切易拉罐吗012---...with an ordinary steak knife?
我知道你们在想什么012---Now, I know what you're thinking.
"孕妇发狂砍杀四人"012---Pregnant woman slays four?
你没买下这些刀子吧012---They didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
没有  确定012---No. Are you sure?
没有012---No.
你不能光靠卖刀来赚够钱的012---You're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice by selling knives.
不  我知道012---No, no. I know that.

糟透了012---It was dreadful.
你对我美好的告白  我却那么回应  我觉得难受极了012---Uh, I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
不  不  没关系012---No, no, that's all right. Um...
我很高兴你能打来012---I'm just glad you called.
罗斯  我得告诉你这件事012---Ross, um, there's something that I've got to tell you.
我另外有一个人了012---There's someone else.
这句话在英国的意思  跟在美国一样吗012---Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
她不知道她想要谁012---She doesn't know which one of us she wants.
我还是那个叫 "柯林" 的家伙.012---Me or this "Colin" guy.
不应该是这样的  不应该有别人012---This isn't how it was supposed to go. I mean, there can't be another guy.
真是的012---Well...
当然得有别人012---Of course there's another guy.
这样更完美012---Heh. This is even more perfect.
现在你得证明你的爱012---Now you have to prove your love.
我什么也不证明  我不听你的了012---I'm not proving anything, okay? I'm done listening to you.
如果我没先听你的跑到机场去012---If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place...
我就不会用拳头猛砸在墙上012---...I wouldn't have put my fist through the wall.
你用拳头猛砸在墙上012---You put your fist through the wall?
不  我没打着  砸在门上了012---No, I missed and hit the door.
但砸的那扇门晃的可厉害了012---But it opened really hard.
你得去伦敦   什么012---You have to go to London. What?
你得去争取她012---Yep. You have to go fight for her.
对啊  当然  太有道理了012---Oh, yeah, sure. That makes sense.
你说你爱她而她却没回应012---Because you already told her you loved her, and she didn't say it back.
然后打来电话告诉你另有其人了012---Then she called you and told you there was another guy.
对  去伦敦吧   吓死她012---So yeah. Go to London. That will scare her.
当瑞秋跟保罗在一起时   你做了什么012---When Rachel was with Paolo, what did you do?
我嘲笑他的口音012---I made fun of his accent.
你退缩了  你让他轻松得手  你完全没有去争取   没错吧012---You sat back and let him have her. You didn't fight at all. Am I right?
你想让艾蜜莉也被抢走012---You want the same thing to happen with Emily?
不想   那就好012---No. All right, then.
去伦敦吧  去为她而战012---Go fight for her. Go to London.
我是说  你和艾蜜莉也可以那样012---I mean, that could be you and Emily.
这样  比他们还美012---That, but nicer.
去伦敦吧012---Just go to London.
真的  快去012---Really? Come on.
到她家门口  给她个惊喜  别把她拱手让人了012---Surprise her. Show up at her doorstep. Don't let her go without a fight.
好  就这么决定  我去012---All right. All right. I'm going to do it. All right.
我要去伦敦  为她而战012---I'm gonna go to London, and I am gonna fight for her.
好  加油012---Okay. Good luck.
罗斯  你要到了机场012---Ross, Ross. If you're going to the airport...

我想到了  我想到赚钱的路子了012---Oh, oh, I did it. I did it. I figured out a way to make money.
我要开自己的按摩院   让法兰克来帮忙012---I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me.
配合他的时间来工作  那他就不必休学了012---And we can work it around his schedule, so he doesn't have to quit school.
啦  啦  啦012---La-la-la.
听起来很好  但你哪来的本钱012---That sounds great. But how can you afford it?
我们在街上012---We were walking down the street...
看见你们以前承包宴席办外烩的小巴车012---...and we saw that van you used for catering.
我们就想到  让我说  让我说012---And we realized... I'm telling it. I'm telling it.
你知道人们需要交通工具012---Okay, you know how people need transportation...
但也需要按摩来放松012---...but they also need massages to relax?
我们可以结合两者  我按摩  法兰克开车012---So I just figured we could combine the two. Okay, I give the massages and Frank drives.
我可以改装一下车子  在后面安个床  你们知道我的想法了012---I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back and you know what I've got?
有进无出的死亡小巴012---A place that no one will ever get out of alive?
不是  你们想嘛  就是给想放松的人搭的出租车012---No, think about it. It's a taxi that people take when they need to relax.
叫轻松任你行012---It's a Relaxi-Taxi.
名字是最精彩的012---The name was my favorite part.
是我想出来的  你乱讲012---Well, I came up with it. You did not!
不是  你想的是轻松之行  一点也不好听012---No. You came up with Relaxi-Cab. That's not good.
哈罗  嗨012---Hello? Hey.
天哪  你在英国吗  艾蜜莉惊喜吗012---Oh, my God. Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
不  因为她还没回家012---No, because she hasn't come home yet.
她整晚都没回家012---And she hasn't been home all night.
很显然是跟那个人在一起012---She's obviously staying with that other guy.
而我则是一晚上站在她家门口的大白痴012---And I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment.
好吧  下班飞机是几点012---All right, when is the next flight out?
大概4个小时后012---About four hours.
再等等几个小时  如果她还不出现  你就回来吧012---Okay, just stay there a couple more hours. If she doesn't show up, come home.
告诉他 "轻松任你行" 的事012---Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.
问问他  是不是听着比 "轻松之行" 好012---And ask him if he thinks that is better than Relaxi-Cab.
不是轻松之行   是轻松车行   就像出租车行012---It's not Relaxi-Cab. It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.
这个比较好012---Ooh, that is better.
我们在伦敦吗012---Are we in London?
你在这干吗  你不能在这012---Why are you doing here? You can't be here.
我有话要对罗斯说012---I've come to talk to Ross.
怎么了012---What?
没事  没事012---Nothing. No, nothing.
我本来想打给他012---I was gonna call him...
你来说你爱他   我就知道012---Oh, you came to tell him you love him. I knew it!
我是对的  我是对的吧  对吗012---I was right! I'm right, right?
我更想跟他谈谈012---I'd really rather talk to him.
我去过他公寓   他不在012---I've been to his apartment and he's not there.
我得跟他谈谈012---And I need to talk to him.
你们知道他在哪吗012---So do you have any idea where he is?
罗斯  你在吗012---Ross, are you there?
我不知道你听不听得见   我还是得说012---Ross, I don't know if you can hear this, but I'm gonna talk anyway.
我在美国  跟你的妹妹和朋友在一起012---I'm in the States with your sister and your friends.
后来我跟柯林分手了012---And it's all over with Colin.

我也爱你012---I love you too.
我现在就去电话亭   打电话给你012---I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth.
你听不见我012---You can't hear me.
真想知道你听不听得见012---I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that.
我想我  要么是刚告诉你我爱你  要么就是让邻居看了笑话012---I suppose I've either told you that I love you or given my neighbors a good laugh.
纽曼太太  如果你在听   一边去  这没你的事012---Mrs. Newman, if you're listening, bugger off. This is none of your business.
我想你八成是听不见012---Suppose there's not much chance you did hear that.
有电话进来了012---And there's the call waiting
我得挂了012---so I should go.

但她没要我和她到金库去嘿咻012---And she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
这事我也遇上了012---Same kind of thing happened to me.
彼萨外送小妹来了012---Woman pizza delivery guy comes over...

我陪你去012---I'll go with you. Oh.

去机场都快来不及了  你没事吧012---Making us late for the airport so... Are you all right?
他没事  没事  他不喜欢我们相处得好012---Oh, he's fine, he's fine. It's just us getting along is difficult for him...

嗨   名字想好了吗012---Hi. Hey. Hey, do we have a baby name yet?
还没有  好难喔012---Ugh, no. It's so hard.
翻遍了这本书也找不到012---I went through this whole book and found nothing.
我想取个勇猛而有自信的名字012---I want a name that's really, like, you know, strong and confident.
例如爱克爽012---You know? Like Exxon.
很适合瓦尔迪兹的小孩012---Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
菲比  你要勇猛的名字  绿巨人怎么样012---Oh, oh, Pheebs. You want a strong name? How about The Hulk?
不  不喜欢绿巨人012---No, I'm not sure about Hulk...
不过我喜欢什么"人"的012---...but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
想取好名字  就取乔伊012---Well, you want a good name, heh, go with Joey.
乔伊是好朋友  好兄弟012---Joey's your pal, Joey's your buddy.
人都在哪里  都跟乔伊一起出去了012---Where is everybody? They're hanging out with Joey.
知道什么啊  要取乔伊012---Know what? If you're gonna name him Joey...
还不如取钱德012---...you should name him Chandler.
少来啊  钱德风趣  世故  一旦了解他012---Oh, come on, Chandler's funny, he's sophisticated, and he's very lovable...
就会觉得他很可爱012---...once you get to know him.
乔伊也很可爱012---Hey, Joey's lovable too.
重要的是当你需要乔伊  他就会出现012---But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
钱德也会出现  只是会慢一点012---Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, he might be a little late...
不过他一定会出现  而且还会带冰汽水过来012---...but he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda...
如果你在很热的时候需要他的话012---...if what you need him for is that you're really hot.
你觉得呢  你觉得呢012---What do you say? What do you say?
跟心爱的人同名的想法很好012---Well, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love.
而且乔伊和钱德都是很棒的名字012---And Joey and Chandler are both great names.
但是我不想012---All right, I don't...
或者就叫绿巨人好了012---Maybe I will just name him The Hulk.
我真不该提起我想给我的孩子起名012---I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it. That's what I wanted to name my kid.
嗨  莫妮卡  如果你今晚想和约书亚睡012---Hey, Mon? If you were hoping to sleep with Joshua for the first time tonight...
你会挑哪件012---...which one of these would you want to be wearing?
我觉得帮别人挑性感睡衣很怪012---You know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
对不起  我太兴奋了012---Sorry. I'm just so excited.
我等了好几个月了  我还跑去染发012---I've been waiting for this for months. I got my hair colored.

菰米饭  烤庐笋和鲑鱼面包丁012---...wild rice, roasted asparagus and salmon en croute.
我不是要做腓力牛排吗012---I thought I was making him filet mignon.
本来是  但餐厅的鲑鱼有剩   所以你决定煮鲑鱼012---Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over.
然后你想到要是你抱怨   "你"就不会煮了012---And then you realized if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking...
你就得上烤马铃薯加健怡可乐012---...and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
"我" 煮菜时火气可真大012---Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.

我整天只听到 "我朋友苏珊好聪明012---...all I heard was, "My friend Susan is so smart.
我朋友苏珊好风趣  我朋友苏珊好棒"012---My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
你觉得艾蜜莉和苏珊之间会擦出火花012---You actually think that something could happen between Emily and Susan?
她们都一起上健身房了012---Hey, they're going to the gym together.
两个女人012---Two women...
劈腿012---...stretching.
她们洗蒸汽浴  开始互相逗弄012---You know, they take a steam together, things get a little playful.

没  但我一定要看012---No, but I'm gonna.
先生  你疯了012---Hi. Hi. You're crazy.
她是艾蜜莉   艾蜜莉是异性恋012---Okay, this is Emily. Emily is straight.
你怎么知道012---How do you know?
我们结婚前原以为卡萝是异性恋012---I mean, we thought Carol was straight before I married her.
我肯定  不喜欢罗斯这个名字012---Yeah, definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
你落井下石的方式还真怪012---What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
我是说宝宝的名字012---No, no, I just meant for the baby.
罗斯有什么不好012---What's wrong with Ross?
就像绿巨人012---It's just, you know, something like this...
就不会遇上这种事吗012---...would never happen to The Hulk, you know.
谁说的  那不真实012---Actually, that's not true.
《绿巨人》第72集里  布鲁斯班纳博士发现012---In The Incredible Hulk, number 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found...
难以置信  我女朋友是同性恋012---You know, never mind. My girlfriend's a lesbian.
所以我决定取名字不是乔伊就是钱德012---So I decided I'm definitely gonna go with either Joey or Chandler.
啊哦  啊哦012---Oh. oh, oh, oh.
你一定要选乔伊012---You gotta pick Joey.
有哪个名人叫钱德012---I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
雷蒙钱德勒  你捏造的人不算012---Raymond Chandler. Someone you didn't make up.
叫乔伊的才没有名人  除了012---Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, heh...
乔伊巴塔富寇012---...Joey Buttafuoco.
他的确是我们的心头之痛012---Yeah, that guy really hurt us. Yeah.
那这样  加起来除以二如何012---Well, how about a compromise then? Okay, what if it's...
例如  钱道伊012---...you know, Chan-no-ey?
乔伊  你想嘛  他绝对当不上总统012---Okay, look, Joey? Come on, think about it. He'll never be president.
绝对不会出现乔伊总统012---I mean, there's never gonna be a President Joey.
听着  我本来不想提的012---All right, look, I didn't want to bring this up.
但钱德是我听过最蠢的名字012---But Chandler is the stupidest name I've heard in my life.
它根本不是名字  连个词都不是012---It's not even a name. It's barely even a word.
它有点接近钱包  但又不是012---Okay, it's kind of like chandelier but it's not.
它是个蠢到爆的名字  笨蛋  它不是名字012---All right? It's a stupid, stupid, non-name.
你说得对  我的名字烂透了012---You're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
对不起  我不是  对不起012---I'm sorry, man. I didn't... I'm sorry.
所以我想就该用乔伊012---So I guess it's Joey, then. I mean...
真好  谢谢你这么费心012---This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
别客气  烹饪能舒缓我的心012---Oh. Please. Cooking soothes me.
吃吧  好的012---So dig in. All right.
看起来都很好吃012---Well, it all looks so good. Mm.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我知道  天哪  这个饭好012---Oh, I know. My God, this rice is so...
我的手艺真好012---I am so good.
你后面012---Behind you.
没事  他们以前就住这里  有时会迁徙回来012---Oh, yeah, sorry. They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.
能不能让他们不要在这里012---Is there, uh...? Is there some way that they could, uh, not be here?
只是  我最怕家禽了012---It's just that, uh, farm birds really kind of freak me out.
啊  好的012---Yeah. Okay, okay.
出去  出去012---Here we go. Here we go. Whoa.
哇啊  抱歉012---Whoa. Oh, sorry.
出去012---There you go.
耶  你们怎么会敲门012---Hey. How'd you do that?
进来012---Come on.
都走了012---All gone. Heh.
只是敏感家禽  是吧012---So, farm birds, huh?
我只有这个怪癖   我发誓012---Yeah, it's my only weird thing, I swear.
我该已经告诉过你了  但我不知道这里会有鸡鸭012---And I would have told you about it but I didn't know that they'd be here.
要不要来点012---So can I serve you a little...
怎么了  怎么了012---What, what, what?
没事  只是我知道它们还在外面012---Nothing. Uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
他们在对门  隔着两道墙012---They're across the hall. I mean, that's two doors away.
它们要啄很久才能把墙啄穿  过来012---It's gonna take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
一点也不好笑012---That's not funny.
是吗  要不012---Uh... Okay, you know...
要不换个地方  会让你好受点012---Would you feel better if we went someplace else?
我们可以把东西打包去你家012---I mean, we could pack all this stuff up and, you know, go to your apartment.
我家正在装修   一团混乱012---Oh, they're working on it this week. It's a mess.
不过  我们可以去我父母家012---But, uh, I'm staying at my parents' house. We could go there.
你父母家  他们出国了012---Your parents'? They're out of town.
对012---Oh.
那里地方很大  视野很宽阔012---It's a huge place, and it's got this gorgeous view of the park.
会非常  非常地浪漫012---It'd be very, very romantic.
你觉得如何  好啊012---What do you say? Yeah, that works.
它们闻得出恐惧012---They can smell the fear.
嗨012---Hey.
班好吗012---How's Ben?
我问他吃不吃东西  他说不要012---Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat. He said no.
我问他要不要睡觉  他说不要012---I asked him if he wanted to sleep. He said no.
我问他想做什么  他说不要012---I asked what he wanted to do. He said no.
所以他在扫地012---So he's sweeping.
嘿  宝贝012---Hey, buddy. Hey.
有苏珊的消息吗012---So, um, any word from Susan?
她说她跟艾蜜莉玩得很开心012---Ooh, yeah, she said she's having so much fun with Emily.
对了  你有没有想过012---Uh, by the by, did it ever occur to you that...
她们或许玩的太开心了一点012---...I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
什么叫太开心012---What's too much fun?
我们结婚时  你和苏珊的那种闲心012---You know, the kind of fun you and Susan had when we were married.
天哪  你还真会乱想012---Oh, my God. You are so paranoid.
是  是吗012---Am I? Yes.
是吗012---Am I?
艾蜜莉我不知道012---I can't speak for Emily...
但苏珊和我的关系很稳定012---...but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
卡萝  我们也是012---Uh-huh. Carol, so were we.
你想像一下012---All right, just imagine for a moment...
苏珊认识了别人  然后一拍即合012---...that Susan meets someone, and they really hit it off.
她们从剧院回来012---Say they're coming back from the theater...
然后去酒吧喝个小酒012---...and they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks.
有说有笑012---They're laughing, you know.
有人有意无意地碰了另外一个人012---Someone innocently touches someone else.
就会有火花012---There's electricity.
那感觉很新鲜  很刺激012---It's new. It's exciting.
你敢说完全没有可能...012---Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility...
...出事012---...of something happening?
或许有  天哪012---Maybe. Oh, my God.
听你说我才真的有些信了012---I didn't really believe it until you just said it.
别的小朋友都不信  但我发誓  那只鸭子真的推了我012---None of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me.
哇  这地方真豪华012---Wow. This place is fabulous.
我带你参观  这是楼下的客厅012---Yeah, let me show you around. This is the downstairs living room.
这有两个客厅012---There's two living rooms?
天啊  你靠这里把到好多美眉吧012---God, growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.
啊  应该会  但我父母刚搬来012---Yeah, well, it would have been, but, uh, my parents just moved here.
你一定靠这里把到了很多美眉012---Well, you should know this place is a real babe magnet.
要亲热吗012---Want to make out?
这样吧  我干吗不把东西先放进冰箱里012---You know, here's an idea. Why don't I put the food in the fridge...
等我们待会儿再吃012---...and we can eat it later?
听起来不错012---That sounds like a plan. Heh.
哪里可以让我梳洗一下012---Um, is there a place that I could go freshen up?
有   直走左边第二个门012---Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, just down the hall and, uh, second door to your left.
儿子  爸妈  你们怎么回来了012---Oh, hi, darling. Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
我们提前结束行程  法国烂透了012---Oh, we cut the trip short. France sucks.
现在情况有点特殊   我带了人回来012---Um, this may be a little weird, but I've got a date here.
了解012---Say no more.
我们拿了吃的  就上楼不妨碍你012---We'll just grab some food, take it with us upstairs and be out of your hair.
那就好  所以你们也不去意大利了012---Oh, that'd be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
没有  意大利也烂012---Yep. Sucks.
你来了012---Hi, you.
啊  天哪012---Oh, my God.
我知道  我不只会做菜012---I know. I can do more than cook.
我喜欢她  她似乎很聪明012---I like her. She seems smart.
瑞秋  我爸妈012---Rachel, my parents.
很高兴认识你们  哈罗  哈罗012---So nice to meet you. Hello, hello.
约书亚  那5百元是给你买日用品的012---Oh, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
什么  这不  你们误会了012---What, this? Oh, no. That's not what it is.
我在时装界工作012---Okay, I work in fashion.
实际上  这才是正式的时装012---See, and this is a real dress, actually.
米兰正在流行012---They're wearing it in Milan.
所以我也必须试穿衣服  观察一般人的反应012---So part of my job is to wear the clothes and then I see how people respond.
然后汇报给布鲁明戴尔的上司012---And then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so...
不过这次012---And obviously, in this case...
我显然得汇报说012---...I am going to report back:
"美国  尚嫌大胆"012---"U.S.A. Not ready."
洛杉矶或许可以012---Maybe in L.A. Yes.
有道理  你们吃过饭了吗012---There you go. So have you kids eaten yet?
我们想等事后  不是012---Well, ahem, we were going to do that after. I mean, um...
接着  正好  我们也饿死了012---Next. Well, we're starving.
不如大家一起出去吃吧012---Why don't we just all go get something to eat?
也好  穿着它窝在家里太可惜了012---Yeah, well, ha, ha, no use wasting this baby just lying around the house.
所以我们去吃饭  对啊012---So we'll go eat. Yeah.
你就穿那样012---You'll wear that.
我们去吃饭  你就穿那样吃饭012---We'll be eating and, of course, you'll be wearing that.
我为我说的话道歉012---Dude, I am sorry about what I said.
不  不  你说得对 这个名字太可笑了012---Nope, nope, you're right. It is a ridiculous name.
也没那么糟   当然有了012---It's not that bad. Yes, it is.
从现在开始  我只有姓没有名了012---From now on, I have no first name.
你就叫宾012---So you're just Bing?
我无名无姓012---I have no name.
那我们要叫你什么012---So, what are we supposed to call you?
好  你们就暂时叫我…012---Okay, uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me...
克林顿012---...Clint.
你才不够酷叫 "克林顿"012---No way are you cool enough to pull off "Clint."
那我可以叫什么012---Okay, so, what name am I cool enough to pull off?
嗯  金012---Um, Gene.
克林顿  就是克林顿012---It's Clint. It's Clint.
金  再见  金  再见012---See you later, Gene. Bye, Gene.
是克林顿   克林顿012---It's Clint. Clint!
金有什么不好012---What's up with Gene?
你穿你的睡衣去吃饭   没错012---You wore your nightie to dinner? Oh, yeah.
最精彩的是  我背后被服务生泼到水时012---And the best part though, was when the waiter spilled water down my back.
我一跳  咪咪就弹了出来012---I jumped up and my boob popped out.
哇  天啊  不012---Oh, my God. Oh, no.
好惨  没关系  我的胸型很漂亮012---Yeah, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
我刚收到艾蜜莉的留言012---So I just picked up a message from Emily.
她要和苏珊要一起去读诗会012---She and Susan are going to a poetry reading together.
所以呢  所以呢012---So? So?
诗012---Poetry?
苏珊是同志012---Susan's gay.
她们志同道合012---They're being gay together.
艾蜜莉是异性恋  你醒醒吧012---Emily's straight. Oh, wake up.
哇012---Wow.
卡萝真的把你害惨了012---Carol really messed you up.
你说什么012---Excuse me?
她害你变成不信任别人   疯疯癫癫爱吃醋012---She turned you into this untrusting, crazy, jealous sycophant.
我不知道爱吃醋是什么  但其他都没说错012---All right, so I don't know what "sycophant" means, but the rest is right.
我不知道你要说啥  我哪有疯疯癫癫爱吃醋012---I don't know what you're talking about. I am not a crazy, jealous person.
什么   她说得没错012---What? She's totally right.
我们以前  你老爱吃马克的醋012---When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark...
其实根本没事  有道理012---...and there was nothing going on. This makes sense.
才怪012---It does not.
当然有道理  高中时你每个女友都不忠012---Sure it does. In high school, you weren't jealous at all...
你也没吃过醋012---...even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you.
直到92  93年 他都很信任别人012---All right, so up until '92, '93, he was very trusting.
然后94年  卡萝离开他  砰  纽约鬼影幢幢012---Then '94 hit, Carol left him, and bam. Paranoid City.
是的012---Yeah.
就是这样  就是这样012---Absolutely, absolutely.
好好玩012---This is so much fun.
一点也不好玩012---This is not fun.
我们只想说012---Look, all we're trying to say is...
别让你和卡萝的事  破坏你和艾蜜莉的感情012---...don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you've got with Emily.
92年的罗斯就不会012---The '92 Ross wouldn't.
我还是觉得马克定有问题012---I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing, though.
什么  你知道吗   我希望艾蜜莉是同志012---Wha...? Well, you know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
击鼓012---Drum roll.
行了  行了012---Okay. Okay.
这样012---All right.
帮个忙  我是马克还是约翰012---Help. Am I a Mark or a John?
你当马克不够高012---Ehh, you're not tall enough to be a Mark.
你或许可以当个好巴尼012---But you might make a good Barney.
拜托  我是认真的012---All right, look, I am serious.
明天3点半我就要上法院012---Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going to the courthouse.
你真的要改名012---You're actually going through with this?
这个名字拖累了我一辈子012---Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
害的我被其他小朋友找喳  女人运也很差012---Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women.
明天4点起  我不是马克约翰森  就是约翰马克森012---So as of 4:00 tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
你的问题在于你自己   与名字无关012---You've got problems because of you, not your name.
别再闹了  钱德这个名字很棒012---This has got to stop. Chandler is a great name.
事实上012---In fact...
好012---Yes.
对不起  我知道你希望宝宝叫乔伊012---I'm sorry, I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey.
但我要  我要让他叫钱德012---But... So I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
真的012---Really?
对  但你也得保留这个名字012---Yeah, but you have to keep the name too.
好  谢了012---Okay, thanks. Okay.
要不要抱下  好012---You want to hug it out? Yeah.
我现在就去告诉法兰克他们012---Okay, I'm gonna go tell Frank and Alice right now.
好的012---Okay.
菲比  再见  再见012---Bye, Pheebs. Okay, bye.
004班机已到达17号门012---Flight 004 is now arriving at Gate 17.
很棒的行李箱  我正要说012---Nice luggage. I was going to say.
嗨  嘿012---Hey. Hi.
我好想你  我也是012---I missed you. Oh, I missed you too.
谢谢你  我玩得很开心012---Thanks for everything, I had a great time.
我也是012---Oh, so did I.
不是舌吻012---No tongue.

莫妮卡  你连床都没有  就是睡在地上的懒骨头012---Monica, you don't even have a bed. You sleep in a ball on the floor!

我很努力想把这里布置得舒适些012---I've worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live.

哎呀  我还是不敢相信你居然戴了耳环012---Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
我知道  我知道  我是谁  大卫鲍伊012---I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowie?
他也会戴耳环吗012---He does that?
不知道   管他呢012---I don't know. Whatever. Ha, ha.

你知道什么啊012---You know what?
要不是你  我永远不会戴耳环012---I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you.

那样  你就可以想待多久就待多久了012---So? Then you could stay as long as you want.
真是那样就好了012---I wish I could.

上次走的太匆忙   结果把我的短裤忘在这里了012---Last time I packed in a rush, I left my knickers here.
我知道  我试着偷穿了一下012---Yeah, I know. I, uh, tried them on.

嘿  小子  我该穿什么去看 "尼克队"比赛012---Hey, guys, what should I wear to a Knicks game?
上面印有  "我不属于这里" 的衣服012---Uh, a T-shirt that says, "I Don't Belong Here"?
你们有票012---You have tickets?
我妈离婚时分到我爸赛季的票   就送给我了012---Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she gave them to me.
很显然  座位相当的好012---Apparently, they're good seats.
天哪  几乎就在球场边上012---Oh, my God! Those are almost on the floor!
你们想要吗012---Do you guys want these?
废话  想  当然想012---Yeah! Yeah, we do!
好吧  给你们012---Well, you got them!
太好了  只要把公寓这里还给我们就行了012---All right! Just give us our apartment back.
想不到有这一招012---Whoa, I didn't see that coming.
你是说真的012---Are you serious?
拜托  我们知道这票值多少012---Come on. We know what these are worth.
你们以为我们是白痴吗012---Do you think we're stupid?
不是白痴  你们比我们想像的要狡猾多了012---Not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
怎么样  想都别想012---What do you say? Forget it.
我才不会为了几张篮球票  放弃我的单身公寓012---Okay? I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
你的 "单身公寓"012---Your "bachelor pad"?
你有女孩住过这吗012---Have you even had a girl here?
没有012---No.
但是乔伊有过  我早上都会跟她们聊天012---But Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
是的  没错012---Yeah, you do.
拜托啦012---Come on!
阿甘  请给我两杯奇诺012---Yes,Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
点的不错012---Good one.
拜托  季票012---Come on. Season tickets.
季票  你知道那代表什么012---Season tickets! You know what that means?
别想了  我绝不让出公寓012---Forget it. I'm not giving up the apartment.
小时候  我爸的公司都会送季票012---Oh come—look,When I was a kid, my dad's company gave season tickets...
给业绩第一的业务员  我爸从来没拿到过012---...to the Number 1 salesman every year. All right? My dad never won.
不过  他也不在业务部  但我还是一直耿耿于怀012---Of course, he wasn't in sales. But still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
你们在啊  嘿012---Hey guys! Hey.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我们开你的玩笑还不够吗012---We don't make enough fun of you already?
艾蜜莉说服我去穿的012---Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.
你知道《轰》合唱团解散了吧012---You do know that Wham broke up?
我喜欢  艾蜜莉也喜欢  这点最重要012---I like it. And Emily likes it. And that's what counts.
你们怎么样012---So, uh, how are you guys doing?
不要觉得戴了耳环还能算正常012---Don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
艾蜜莉呢012---Where's Emily?
去跟她舅舅道别去了012---Ugh, she's saying goodbye to her uncle.
她不喜欢住这吗  对  对啊012---Didn't she, like, just get here? Yeah! Yeah.
别激动  大哥012---Easy, tiger.
我真的很讨厌这样012---I just hate this so much.
每次去机场接她  我都好开心012---Every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's so great.
但是我又会想  "过两天又要送她来机场了"012---But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back in a couple of days, dropping her off."
那你要怎么办  也没办法012---So, what'll you do? There's nothing to do.
她住那  我住这012---She lives there. I live here.
她得搬来这里012---She'd have to move here.
她应该搬来这里012---She should move here.
什么012---What?
我可以叫她跟我住  你说真的吗012---I can ask her to live with me. Are you serious?
为什么不  我说  为什么不  你们才认识六个星期012---Why not? I mean, why not? You've only known her six weeks!
我冰箱里有盒牛奶放得比你们这个还更久012---I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with.
听着  我跟她在一起时  就像012---Look, guys, when I'm with her, it's like...
她会激发出我最好的一面012---Uh, she brings out this great side of me.
我的意思是  我爱她  你知道吗012---I mean, I love her, you know?
我也爱那盒牛奶012---And I love the milk!
但我不会让某个英国女生搬来和我住012---But I won't ask some British girl to move in with me.
乔伊  现在该你说了012---Joey, you say things now.
罗斯  他说得对  艾蜜莉很棒012---Look, Ross. He's right. Emily's great.
她很棒012---She's great!
但这样太快了  你只会吓到她012---But this is too soon. You're only gonna scare her.
我不想吓到她  没错012---I don't wanna do that. No.
你不想搞砸了  就别太心急012---You don't want to wreck it. Don't go too fast.
你们说得对  我知道  你们是对的012---No. You're right. I know, you're right.
我不会这样做的012---I'm not going to do it.
谢了  两位  不客气012---Thanks guys. No problem.
记得要走时摇它两下 （《轰》所唱的歌词）012---Just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
太难了  太难了012---It's too hard. Too hard!
好了  两位  最后的机会012---All right, boys. Last chance for the tickets.
否则  我就送给我的新男友  约书亚012---Otherwise, I give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
不用了  谢谢012---No, thank you.
等一下  拜托  跟她们换啦012---Wait, wait. Come on, come on! Let's trade.
时机正好  我刚把马桶给堵住了012---The timing's perfect! I just clogged the toilet!
我跟你一样想要球票  但住过这里012---Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment...
就觉得对面太小了  你看过 "献给阿尔吉侬的花束"吗012---...after we've lived here! Ever read Flowers for Algernon?
有012---Yes.
你看过 "运动画报" 吗012---Ever read Sports Illustrated?
没有  我没偷看过你的012---No, I didn't read yours!
我们今晚就可以去看球012---We can go to the game tonight!
她们提出比季票更好的东西012---The only way I'll consider this...
我才要考虑012---...is if they offer more than just season seats.
是 "尼克队"  去他的 "尼克队"012---It's the Knicks! Screw the Knicks.
我不是那个意思  我是说012---I didn't mean that. I just meant...
这层公寓的价值要更大012---...that the apartment is worth so much more.
"尼克队"万岁012---And the Knicks rule all.
对  "尼克队"万岁012---Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
嘿  怎么样  要不要012---Hey, so? Are you going to do it?
不要  因为这个交易不公平012---No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
好吧  听着012---All right, look.
要是你们能保住公寓  又拿到球票呢012---What if you could keep the apartment and the tickets?
成交012---Done!
让我说完  我是说我们来打赌  赢家才行012---Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet. Winner takes all.
我们可能输光012---Ooh, we could get nothing.
也可能满载而归  我喜欢012---Or you can end up with everything. Oh, I like that.
怎么样012---What do you say?
不要  赌了啦012---No! Just do it!
真有说服力啊012---Oh! Oh, I'm convinced!
拜托啦  我也会为你这么做012---Come on, man! You know I'd do it for you.
因为你是我最好的朋友012---Because you're my best friend.
好吧  但你一整年不准再用这招012---All right. But you can't use that again for a whole year.
我赌了012---I'm in.
好兴奋喔  你们要赌什么012---This is so exciting! What are you going to bet?
好吧  我们让菲比决定012---Okay. Well, we should let Phoebe decide...

如果是长久的打算就不同了012---I mean it would be different if it was way into the future...

我告诉你  这次我绝不妥协012---And I'll tell you, I'm not doing them this time.
我才不在乎碗盘堆到有多高了012---I don't care if those dishes sit until they're covered...
我回家就洗012---I'll do them when I get home.
对了012---Yeah. Oh, hey.
艾蜜莉在伦敦看中一件婚纱012---Um, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
这么快  对  但尺寸不合适012---Already? Yeah, but it didn't fit.
幸运是  这里有家店有合适的012---Luckily, there's a store here with one left in her size.

我想知道你还好吧012---And I was just wondering how you were.
还行啦012---Ahem. Oh.
如果是你要结婚  我会觉得有点012---If you were getting married, heh, I would feel kind of...
你懂吗   懂012---You know? Yeah, yeah.
我的确吓了一跳  不过012---It def... Uh, it definitely took me by surprise. But, you know...
我没事012---...uh, I'm okay.

"撑着点"012---"Hang in there"?
不  我不是说012---Oh, no, I didn't mean...
你大概还没听说过一场真恋情  叫 "我与约书亚"吗012---I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called "me and Joshua"?
我以为你们就约会过四次012---Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates,

我跟约书亚在一起那么合拍   你跟艾蜜莉在一起也是012---I'm right there with Joshua. You are right there with Emily.
有点像  大家打个平手012---And it's y'know, it's kind of like it's a tie.

不  不  不  ...012---No, no! No, no, no, no, no!
你得去医院了  你要去医院012---You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic!
还有睡衣店012---And a pajama store!

菲比   对012---Phoebe? Yeah?
你能等一小会儿吗  不行012---Can you just hold on for one minute? No!
你现在就得让我进去012---You have to let me in right now!
你一个人吗   对012---Are you alone? Yes!
好吧012---All right.
太烦人了012---This sucks.
去那诊所检查前  我一晚上都不能睡012---I have to stay up all night before I go to the stupid clinic.
困死了012---I'm so tired.
现在才六点012---It's 6:00.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
听说你和约书亚   要跟罗斯艾蜜莉一起出去吃饭012---I hear you and Joshua are going out with Ross and Emily.
我觉得  这么做很有风度012---And I think... I think that's really cool.
是啊  你处理得相当好啊012---Yeah, I think you're handling that really well.
"处理"012---"Handling it"
什么意思  没什么好处理的012---What do you mean? There's nothing to handle.
如果不是和约书亚在交往  也许我接受不了这事012---Maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
不过反正他们也结不了婚  什么012---Y'know, They're not gonna get married anyway. What?
拜托  他们这么草率  简直太可笑了012---Come on. They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!
他们应该先订婚   一年012---They'll be engaged for like what? A year?
这期间  他们俩总会有人想通012---And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realize what they've done...
然后再取消婚约012---...and call the thing off.
你们会先在我的婚礼上跳舞012---I'm telling you, you'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.
我参加婚礼从不跳舞012---You know, I don't dance at weddings.
为什么   婚礼是认识女生的好地方012---Why not? Because weddings are a great place to meet women.
而我要跳舞   就像这副德性012---When I dance, I look like this.
你好  嘿012---Hey, man. Hey.
四周后的今天你们有事吗012---So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
没事  没事012---Nothing. Nothing.
我…012---I am...
有空012---...free.
太好了  因为艾蜜莉和我一个月后要结婚012---Great, Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
什么  没错012---What? Yup.
一个月后   对012---In a month? Yeah.
你是说30天后  对012---You mean 30 days? Yeah.
从今天算起  对012---From now? Yeah.
太棒了  对012---That's great! Yeah, ha, ha.
艾蜜莉一直想在她父母结婚的  同一个漂亮地方举行婚礼012---Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married ...
但那里马上要拆除了  所以012---...but it's gonna be torn down, so...
我知道这很疯狂  但所有事从头到尾都很疯狂012---I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy,...
我不知道  就是感觉该这样012---...and I don't know, just feels right, you know?
那是我经期的第二天012---Hey, that's the day after I start menstruating!
这不是我的012---This isn't mine.
嘿  瑞秋012---Ahem Hey, Rachel.
嗨012---Hi.
什么事012---What's up? Oh, heh.
你在电话里的声音神经兮兮的012---Your voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
没事  我就是想见你012---Oh, nothing. I just wanted to see you.
见你  抱你012---See you and hug you.

坐012---Sit.
你还好吗012---You okay?
好得不得了  我非常  非常地高兴012---I'm more than okay. I am really, really happy.
想知道为什么吗012---Want to know why?
我想吗012---Do I?
因为我真为我们俩高兴012---Because I am really happy about us.
我认为我们发展得很好012---I think we are, I think we are so on the right track.
我意思是  我们相处的好  我们也很合拍012---Y'know? I mean, I think we are working. I think we are clicking.
你懂吗  当然012---You know? Yeah, sure, sure.
我们  我们很合拍012---We're... We're clicking. Yeah.
如果说有什么小缺憾012---If there was just one little area...
需要加强的  我觉得012---...where I think we need to work on, I would think...
应该就是我们还不够疯狂012---...it's that we're just not crazy enough.
老实说  我不太同意这点012---I got to say, I'm not too sure I agree with that.
好吧  你知道吗  你对的012---Well, yeah. You know, yeah, you're right.
当然  我们也很开心012---I mean, we have our fun. Yeah?
但是012---But, uh...
我是说像疯--狂一样  你懂吗012---We ju... I mean like craaaazy! You know?
好吧  这个012---Okay. All right.
这个听起来  是有点点仓促012---This is gonna, this is gonna to sound, you know, a little, um, hasty.
但你先听听看012---But, uh, just go with me.
我们结婚怎么样012---What if we got married?
什么  我知道  你会觉得012---What? Oh, I know. It's so totally like:
"哇  我们行吗"  我是说012---"Whoa, can we do this?" You know? I mean...
就是感觉该这样  你不觉得  该这样吗012---But it just feels right. Don't you think? It does.
就是感觉应该这样   你说呢012---I mean, it just feels right. Don't you...?
瑞秋012---Rachel, um...
你是个012---you're
很特别012---a real
的女性012---special lady.
但是我的离婚还没办完012---But my divorce isn't final yet
而且  我们才约会了四次012---and, and, and we've been on four dates.
所以我是想说  不要012---So I'm thinking  no...
不过012---but
谢了012---thanks.
你这个白痴012---You idiot!
姓名  乔伊崔比亚尼012---Your name, please? Joey Tribbiani.
你是不是整夜没睡觉  来准备接受诊疗012---Mm-hm. and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study.
嗨  先生012---Uh, sir?
是的  好的012---Yes, he did.
好吧  几分钟后我们再叫你012---All right. We'll call you in a few minutes.

你介意我坐吗  请便012---Do you mind if I sit? No, please.
你来看什么012---So, uh, what are you in for?
我说梦话012---I talk in my sleep.
真巧啊  我专爱听梦话012---What a coincidence. I listen in my sleep.
给个你的电话好吗012---So why don't you give me your number?
准备好了吗   好了012---Are you ready? Okay. Yeah.
我接到了  我的012---I got it! Mine! Aah!

你扔的也太没水准了012---That was a terrible throw!
我才不直接扔给你  太假了012---I won't throw it right to you. That's not real.
你看我  还担心太假吗012---Look at me. My big concern is what's real?
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我们真的很悲哀  对吧012---We're really sad, aren't we?
是啊  没错012---Yeah, I think we are.
这还不是我的婚纱012---This isn't even my dress.
至少不是去 "还不算太晚婚纱店" 租的012---At least you didn't rent yours from a store called "It's Not Too Late."
我要去换掉  我也是012---I'm changing out of this. Me too.
要不  再过半小时后  我也是012---In, like, a half an hour? Me too.
这次直接扔给我  好吧012---All right, now throw it straight this time. Okay.
我下一个结婚了012---I'm getting married next! Yay!
我现在好讨厌一般普通的衣服012---I hate my regular clothes now.
低头一看就知道012---You know? I look down and I know...
今天不是我人生最特别的日子012---...this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
是啊  我意思是刚开始还挺好玩012---Yeah. I mean, it was kind of fun for a while...
你不觉得有点傻吗012---...but didn't you feel kind of silly?
是有点012---I guess.
哦  天哪012---Oh, my God!
啊  你这个骗子012---Oh, you're such a cheater!
哈罗  小可爱们012---Hello, little ones.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
乔伊不再打呼了吗  会的012---So is Joey going to stop snoring? Yep!
而且有个美女答应跟我约会012---And a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.
乔伊本来也想约她  但她选了我012---Joey wanted to ask her out, but, uh, you know, she picked me.
怎么可能呢012---How'd that happen?
因为我更酷012---Because I'm cooler.
不  说真的012---No, seriously.
她是那种  让乔伊意识不清的女孩012---She's the kind of girl... Joey was unconscious.
嗨  伙计们  你们好吗012---Hey, you guys! What's happening?
天哪012---Oh, my God.
那是什么  这是睡眠诊所给的012---What is that? Oh! They gave it to me at the sleep clinic.
帮助我不打呼012---And it's going to help me not to snore.
那你现在在睡觉吗012---Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?
没睡觉应该不用咬着它吧012---'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
我当然知道012---I know I don't have to.
味道不错012---It tastes good.
还有  你看起来很酷012---Plus, you look cool.
我刚给约书亚打电话012---Well, I just called Joshua.
怎么样012---Oh, how'd it go?
我尽力说服他我不是012---I did my best to convince him that I'm not...
想结婚想的发疯的女孩012---...some crazy girl who is dying to get married.
我只是处在情绪低落的非常时期  他怎么说012---And I'm going through a hard time. What'd he say?
他的录音电话表示很理解012---Well, uh, his answering machine was very understanding.
我好郁闷012---I feel blue. Ugh.
啊  甜心012---Aw. Sweety.
我打赌他一定会给你电话012---I bet you anything he'll call you again.
可能吧  但我想  我都不在乎这个了012---Yeah, maybe. But, you know, I don't think I even care.
我想他不是我为之伤心的那个012---I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.
我知道我说过  我完全不在意罗斯结婚012---I know I said I'm totally okay with Ross getting married.
但是实际上012---But as it turns out...
我还接受不了012---...I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
是啊  有可能012---Yeah, maybe.
我正在努力寻找原因012---And I'm just trying to figure out why.
找到了012---Any luck?
是啊  罗斯和我总是012---Well, yeah. You know how Ross and I have always been...
和了分  分了和  然后又分012---...on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again?
我一直觉得总会在什么时候012---I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road...
我们又会和好012---...we would be on-again.
又会的012---Again.
知道吗  我们都这么觉得012---You know what? I think we all did.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿012---Hey.
我订好了周日晚上的餐厅了012---I got us reservations for Sunday night.
9点整厄尼之家餐厅  行吗012---How about Ernie's at 9:00?
行  你最好还是改成3012---Yeah, well, you, uh, better make it for three.
但下午3点不应该会饿吧012---See, I don't know if we're going to be hungry at 3:00.
是 3个人012---Three people.
约书亚不会去了012---Joshua's not going to be there.
怎么了  我想他是要跟我分手了012---What happened? Um, well, I think he broke up with me.
天哪  为什么012---No. Why?
很明显  他经不起惊吓012---Apparently, he scares easy.
瑞秋  我很难过012---Rachel, I'm sorry.
没关系012---Eh, it's okay.
有时候  人生往往会事与愿违012---Sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.
过来012---Come here.
你不用去接艾蜜莉吗012---Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
要啊012---Yeah. Yeah.
你行吗  可以012---Are you okay? Yeah.
我还有姐妹们陪我012---I got my girls.
好吧012---Okay.
你知道怎么才能让你振作起来012---Hey, you know what might cheer you up?
什么012---What?
说实话012---I got to tell you...
我的心情真的好多了012---...this really does put me in a better mood.
真希望有整天穿婚纱的工作012---Ah, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.
也许以后真会有的012---Maybe someday there will be.
完了  是钱德来借晚上约会的蜡烛012---Oh, God, that's Chandler coming by to borrow candles for his big date.
瑞秋  别开门  他会看见我们012---No, Rachel, don't get it! He'll see us!
对   新郎不能见新娘012---No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride.
我又不嫁给钱德012---I'm not going to marry Chandler.
被他看到就得嫁了012---Not after this!
伙计们  放轻松就对了012---Okay guys, just relax.
我愿意012---I do!
我得走了  等等  约书亚012---I gotta go. Wait, Joshua!
这次真的是玩完了012---Yeah, well, that ought to do it.
这里有吃的   够了012---Food's here. Fair enough.
还有15分钟012---Fifteen-minute warning.
太迟了012---Late.
大哥  我还想睡觉呢012---Dude, I am trying to sleep!
好像突然间发生了好多事012---It seems like all of a sudden, so much is happening.
是啊  罗斯要结婚012---I know. Ross is getting married.
菲比在做人012---Phoebe's making people.
大家都在忙  只有我们坐在这里012---Everybody's doing stuff. We just sit here.
要是我死了  大家只会从这张椅子的屁股印上012---If I died, the only way people would know I was here...
知道我存在过012---...would be by the ass print on this chair.
我们得有所作为  做一件大事012---Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge.
我们可以去爬圣母峰 (珠穆朗玛峰)012---We could climb Mount Everest.
不…不是蠢事  是大事012---No, no. Not something stupid. Something huge.
不…我在录影带上看到广告012---No, no, no. I saw an ad for this video.
每天都有人在爬  我们也可以去爬012---People climb that thing every day. We could totally do that.
谁说不行  只不过是爬山012---Why not? I mean, it's just climbing.
只不过很陡012---It's just steep.
对012---Yeah.
我们去攻顶  在山顶留屁股印一定很爽012---We're going to Everest. Okay? It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
在干什么  我们要去爬圣母峰012---What's up? We're gonna climb Mount Everest.
对  没错  真的012---Yeah, baby. Really?
我也去问过012---I looked into that.
但是要花六万元   而且可能会死012---Yeah, but, I mean, it costs like $60,000, and, you know, you could die. And...
你们一定会死012---And you would die.
这样啊012---Oh, well.

你以为看你们在一起很好受吗012---You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
问题的重点是我不想要这样012---Well, the point is I don't need this right now.

不要回答012---Don't answer that.
你说你想谈  那就谈啊  她功夫怎么样啊012---You said you wanted to talk about it. Let's talk about it. How was she?

别再说了012---Oh! Just stop.
你这么坦然认错012---The way you owned up to everything...

我妈一直觉得我们无法复合012---I mean, my mom never thought this would work out.
她说  "出轨一次  就会有第二次 "012---She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
真希望没有这四个月的空白012---I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
但要是时间能让你看清楚一点012---But if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
我们当时分手了012---We were on a break!
你似乎真的很喜欢她012---You seem to really like her.
我能怎么办  我们说好只在一起两周012---Yeah, but what am I gonna do? We both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing,
不要有承诺012---You know? No commitment.
罗斯  那个女孩整晚都跟你的朋友012---Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends...
嚷着要听你的事012---...asking to hear stories about you...
还看摩妮卡的相册012---...looking through Monica's photo albums.
如果你只想在一起两周  你才不会这么做012---I mean, you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
你这么想012---You think? Heh.
她还有14个小时才要去机场012---You've got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
你却坐在走廊上012---And you're sitting here in a hallway...
陪着一个28岁  嘴肿起来的老啦啦队长浪费时间012---...with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
你说得对  对012---Yeah, you're right. Yeah.

参加婚礼  当然会哭012---You're at the wedding. You have to cry.
需要手帕吗  不  我有喜帖012---Handkerchief? No, I got my invitation.

你收到罗斯的婚礼喜帖了吗012---Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross' wedding?
没收到012---No.

太嫉妒了  你们都要去012---I'm so jealous you're all going.
怀孕九个月居然不能坐飞机012---I can't believe I never knew you can't fly in your third trimester.
从来都不知道  我也不知道012---I never knew that. I didn't, either.
我知道012---I knew that.
我也不知道  但你们的表情太喜感了012---So didn't know that. But you should see your faces.
嗨  你们在干嘛  嘿012---Hi, guys. What's up?
也没干嘛012---We're hanging out.
这是什么  罗斯的喜帖012---What's this? Is this Ross' wedding invitation?
也许该藏的是那一张012---Maybe that's the one we should have actually hidden.
不  不  不必那样012---Oh, no. No, you guys, come on. You don't have to do that.
我替他高兴啊012---I'm happy for him.
真的  我  我很…012---I am. I really... I'm... I'm ha...
我会调节的012---I'll work on it.
对不起  甜心012---I'm sorry, honey.
瑞秋  你会去吧012---Rach, you're going to come though, aren't you?
喔  甜心  我不知道012---Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
该不会  "她不去  我们就不去吧"012---This isn't one of those "If she doesn't come, we don't come"?
我已经买票了012---Because I already bought my ticket...
你不去才会真的很奇怪012---You know what would be real weird? If you weren't there.
你就考虑下吧  我会的  我会考虑的012---Just say you'll think about it, okay? No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
这是谁送的  罗斯送的012---Who's this from? That's Ross'.

他记得012---He remembered.
记得什么012---Remembered what?
好几个月前  我们经过一家古董店012---It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store.
我看到这个别针  对他说  小时候我奶奶012---I saw this pin, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had...
有一个一模一样的012---...when I was a little girl. Oh.
他居然记得012---I can't believe he remembered.
他肯定花了不少钱012---This must have cost him a fortune.
他居然这么大方012---I can't believe he did this.
罗斯 记得他大学爱上卡萝时012---Ross? Remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol...
就送了她一只超贵的水晶鸭012---...and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
你刚才在说什么012---What did you just say?
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
来自北京的457号班机  刚刚抵达012---Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

高兴012---...and your cat.
所以很显然  我已经放下你了012---So obviously, I am over you.
我已经放下你了012---I am over you.

对不起012---I'm sorry.
我不该说吗012---Was I not supposed to?
是你要分手的  记得吗012---You're the one who ended it.
因为我很气你  不是因为我不爱你了012---Yeah, because I was mad at you. Not because I stopped loving you.
你还爱我012---You still love me?
没有012---No.
什么意思  你想复合吗012---What does this mean? What do you...? I mean, do you want to get back together?

我只是觉得012---I just... I feel...
我居然会想跟你复合  我们根本就完了012---I can't believe I even thought of getting back together with you. We are so over.
无所谓012---Fine by me!
顺便告诉你  这种事并不常见012---And, hey, just so you know, it's not that common...
并非男人都会这样  这是很严重的012---...it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal!
我就知道012---I knew it!
瑞秋来了  她是不是很美啊012---Rachel's coming up. Doesn't she look pretty, Jack?

我没舞伴不能去舞会  时间来不及了012---I can't go to my own prom without a date. I can't. It's too late.
要是你不去  我也不想去了012---If you're not going, then I don't wanna go either.
我有个好主意012---I have a wonderful idea.
你带瑞秋去参加舞会012---You should take Rachel to the prom.
看够了  关掉吧012---We've seen enough. Let's turn it off.

不会吧012---No.
你真的不去  对012---You're really not going? Yeah.
我会很难面对012---It's just going to be too hard.
毕竟012---You know, I mean...
他是罗斯012---...it's Ross.
我怎么能看着他结婚012---How can I watch him get married?
这样最好  真的012---You know? It's just for the best, you know? It is.
而且总得有人陪菲比012---Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.
到时她的肚子会很大012---She's going to be pretty big by then...
她会需要别人绑鞋带012---...and she'll need someone to help her tie her shoes.
她要生的时候送她去医院012---Drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labor.
你没有车012---You don't have a car.
驾照也过期了012---And your license expired.
看吧  事情那么多  时间又那么少012---Yeah. See, there's so much to do, and I have so little time to do it in.
你们看  你们看012---All right, check it out. Check this out.
这里有完整的博物馆录影带012---It says there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums.
"几乎如同身临其境"012---"It's almost as good as being there."
更棒  你不能只穿内裤去博物馆012---It's better. You can't go to a museum in your underwear.
可以  但以后你会被博物馆封杀的012---Well, you could, but probably just the one time.
我们可以去租所有景点的录影带012---I bet we could get videos of all the sights...
然后搬台放影机到旅馆的房间  我们就不必出房间了012---...get a VCR in our hotel room, we'd never even have to go outside.
那样的话   一定要租 "虎胆龙威"012---If we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard.
听说英国版本的更好看012---Oh-ho, I bet the British version is good.
我来这儿  已经上了十次厕所了012---That's like the 10th time I've peed since I've been here.

至于邀请名单有你  我  钱德012---Okay, now, uh, in terms of the invite list, obviously I got you, me and Chandler.
我也会请阿甘  因为我们讨论得很大声012---And I'm invite Gunther because, well, we've been talking pretty loud.
我会去的012---I'll be there.
听好  派对是为你办的012---Oh, listen. I know it's your party...
但我想限制博物馆怪脚的人数012---...but I'd really like to limit the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.

跟我的伴郎筹划我的单身派对啊012---Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
祝你们办得比上次好012---Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
这不难  因为这次不会在012---I don't think it's gonna be that difficult, considering this one won't take place...
必胜客的地下室举办了012---...in the basement of a Pizza Hut. Heh.

待会见012---Okay, see you later. Yeah.
好好办不能疯的派对吧012---Ha, ha. Have fun planning your mellow party.
会有脱衣舞娘012---There's gonna be strippers there.
他没说不要脱衣舞娘啊012---He didn't say anything about no strippers.
他刚刚才说不要的  我当作没听到012---He just said, "No strippers." Oh. I chose not to hear that.
你看我买了什么   买了什么012---Look what I got, look what I got, look what I got.
居然有这种童装012---Can you believe they made these for little people?
给乡下小孩穿的012---Aw. Little Village People.
好  你看这件  我最喜欢这件012---Aw, okay. Look at this one. This is my favorite.
太可爱了012---Oh, that is so sweet.
菲比一定会很喜欢打扮他们012---Phoebe's gonna love dressing them in these.
但到时候  替他们打扮的不是她012---Huh. Except, uh, Phoebe's not gonna be the one who gets to dress them.
因为她不能把宝宝留着012---I guess she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
天哪  这真是最今人沮丧的送礼会012---Oh, my God, we are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
等等  除非我们送她产后可以用的礼物012---Wait a minute. Unless we give her all gifts that she can use...
像普通咖徘  龙舌兰酒012---...after she's done being pregnant. Like, um, regular coffee. Tequila.
还有她一直想要的皮裤012---Oh, and somebody can get her those leather pants she's always wanted.
她一定会很高兴012---Oh, she's gonna love that.
这是什么玩意儿012---What the hell is this?
送我两个月后才能用的礼物012---What, did you actually thought it'd make me feel better?
我的心情会好吗012---To give me something I can't even use for another two months?
真是烂透了012---This sucks! Oh!
好了  下个礼物呢012---All right, what's my next present?
我们都没带012---I don't have anything.
对了  那个脱衣舞娘012---Hey, listen, man, about the stripper...

嘿012---Hey...
跳脱衣舞的012---Stripper.
舞娘把戒指偷走了012---The stripper stole the ring!
钱德  起床  舞娘把戒指偷走了012---Chandler, get up, get up! The stripper stole the ring!
什么  戒指被偷了012---What? The ring is gone!
别闹  给我一分钟先让我清醒一下012---Oh. Okay, just, like, give me a minute to wake up for this.
你把戒指弄丢了  你是最烂的伴郎012---You lost the ring. You're the worst best man ever.
一点都不好笑  怎么办012---Dude, this isn't funny. What am I gonna do?
昨晚我去睡觉  一切正常012---I go to sleep last night, everything's cool.
等我醒来  舞娘不见了  戒指也不见了012---I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone, and the ring is gone!
你跟她上床了  废话012---You slept with the stripper? Of course!
你们两个012---Hi, guys.
嗨  菲比012---Hi, Phoebe.
我想说声抱歉  我昨天在送礼会上012---Ahem. I wanted to apologize if I, you know, seemed a tad edgy yesterday...
似乎凶了点012---...at my shower.
没事  都是荷尔蒙在作怪012---You know, it's just the hormones. You know?
别这样  我们  对啊  荷尔蒙嘛012---No, we... Hormones. Yeah. Hormones.
谢谢你们  你们真有心012---Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. It was just... It was so sweet.
真有心012---Oh, okay. So sweet.
你似乎好多了012---Yeah. Wow, you seem to be doing much better.
太好了  你现在怎样  很好012---That's great. How are things going? Good.
可是  最近的注意力都在我自己身上012---No, but... Okay, it feels like everything's been about me lately.
你们怎么呢012---So, what's happening with you?
我们正在说  我不去参加罗斯的婚礼012---Oh. Well, actually, we were just talking about me not going to Ross' wedding.
曾经有那段过往012---Oh. It just might be too hard...
我可能很难面对现实012---...given the history and all that.
这让我想起当年流落街头时012---Wow, this reminds me of the time when I was, um, living on the street.
有人说我陪他上床就请我吃饭012---And this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
这两件事哪里像啊012---Well, how is this like that?
我想想  的确不像012---Well, let's see. It's not really like that.
因为那样才算是问题012---Because, you see, that was an actual problem.
你这只是高中女生无病呻吟012---And, uh, yours is just, like, a bunch of high-school crap...
没人在乎的012---...that nobody really gives... Yeah.
抱歉  我只是012---Well, I'm sorry. I just thought...
泪眼攻势来了012---All right, here come the waterworks.
我已经完全没辙了012---Oh. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
我打给中介站  他们不管012---I called the company that sent her, and they don't care.
我打119又被对方吼骂012---And I called 911 and they yelled at me.
都这样了  还不能算紧急事件吗012---If this isn't an emergency, then what is?
嘿  两位  嘿012---Hey, guys. Hey.
谢谢你  昨晚派对办得很棒012---I just wanted to thank you for last night. What a great party.
博物馆那伙人玩得很爽012---And the guys from work had a blast.
其中有一个没参加过单身派对012---You know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
另一个没参加过任何派对  所以012---Yeah, and another one had never been to a party before, so...
那个  结婚戒指012---So, uh, hey, that wedding ring, huh?
可真漂亮  漂亮吧012---Man, that is nice. Yeah. Yeah, right?
我也想给自己买一只012---Yeah, I was thinking I might pick one of those babies up for myself.
去哪里能买得到啊012---Where might one get one of those?
那只戒指  我奶奶刚来到这个国家时012---That ring, when my grandmother first came to this country...
全身上下只有那只戒指  和一小包衣服012---...that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
所以那只戒指可以说是独一无二012---So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.
显然  它是我家的传家宝012---Oh, absolutely. It's been in my family for generations.
每个新娘戴上它  都能预示着幸福到老012---And every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
所以简直算是一只魔戒012---So you might say it's a magic ring.
被脱衣舞娘偷了012---Yeah, the stripper stole it.
我的戒指  我的结婚戒指012---My ring? My wedding ring?
脱衣舞娘偷了我的结婚戒指012---The stripper stole my wedding ring?
怎么  怎么会这样012---How? How could this happen?
原因就在于你说了 "乔伊  你来当我的伴郎吧"012---Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey, Joey, why don't you be my best man."
好  我来报警012---All right, all right. Fine. I'm gonna call the cops.
我搞砸了  你也用不着报警抓我啊012---Dude, I screwed up. You don't have to turn me in.
不是抓你  是抓那个舞娘  我试过了012---Not on you, on the stripper. Oh, yeah, well, I already did that.
他们说等侦破完所有谋杀案再说012---They said they're gonna look into it right after they solve all the murders...
那好  就找舞娘中介站012---Okay, we'll call the company that sent her.
我也试过了012---I did that too.
他们不肯透露她的真名或电话012---They wouldn't give me her name or number.
他们说我再打去  就要报警012---They said if I bother them again, they'd call the police.
我说  "你去报警啊  就说我掉了一只戒指"012---I said, "You talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring."
乔伊  你说说  一点办法也没有了012---So, what, Joey? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do?
怎么会这样  罗斯  我真的很抱歉012---How could this happen? Look, Ross, I am so, so sorry.
这样  我们何不再叫她一次012---Well, what if we just, uh, called her...
用假名召她  然后去我的办公室012---...used a fake name and had her come to my office?
好像不赖  但我们只能找戒指012---Oh, that sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!
菲比  你的茶012---Here's your tea, Phoebe.
感觉真好012---Mm. It's so good.
谢谢  真好心012---Oh, thanks. That's sweet.
那就好  你喜欢就好012---Good. So glad you like it.
怎么了012---Oh. What?
什么  茶是她泡的012---What? She made the tea.
不是  我刚才阵痛了012---No, I think I just had a contraction.
什么  天哪012---You what? My God.
几分钟前就有一次012---Yeah, I thought I felt one a couple minutes ago.
这次绝对错不了  你不能在这里生012---And now I know that definitely was one. Well, you can't have the baby here!
男生搬走之后我还没消毒012---I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!
没事  别怕012---It's okay. We're gonna be okay.
你懂什么  我来烧水  撕床单012---You know what? It's okay. I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets.
别紧张  可能是假性阵痛012---Ow, it's all right. It's probably false labor.
他们说  接近预产期会这样  赶快012---They said that, that can happen near the end. So just...
去拿书来  瑞秋  拿书来012---Somebody get the book. Rachel, get the book.
书  好  好012---The book. Okay. Okay. Here.
《圣经》啊   我哪懂啊012---The Bible? I don't know!
好  很好  就这样012---All right. Okay, okay. This is great.
钱德  你站到桌子后面012---Uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
但愿她一进来不会认得你   因为012---And when she comes in, hopefully she won't recognize you because...
她怎么会不认得你012---Well, why would she?
然后  你对罗斯和我打暗号012---Uh, okay. And then you buzz Ross and I.
你是冈萨勒斯先生  我是王先生012---You be Mr. Gonzales, and I'll be Mr. Wong.
民族大熔炉012---Diverse.
有人叫警卫吗012---Anybody call for security?
你们冷静012---You be cool.
好  哪位是阿甘中央咖啡厅012---Okay. Which one of you guys is Gunther Central Perk?
嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joey.
我的戒指呢  我过世的奶奶的结婚戒指呢  在哪里012---Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring! Where is it?
你还真冷静012---Way to be cool, man.
他在说什么012---What's he talking about? Oh!
床头柜的丝绒盒里有只戒指012---There was a ring in a box on my nightstand.
你一走  它就不见了012---After you left, it was gone.
等等  你们认为我偷了戒指012---Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
对012---Yeah.
一定是你偷的  少废话  从实招来012---We know you took it! So just save yourself the time and confess.
你们谁啊  少年侦探团吗012---Okay, Who are you, the Hardy Boys?
我根本没必要偷什么白痴戒指012---I don't need to steal some stupid ring.
我一星期能赚一千六012---I make $1,600 a week doing what I do.
你们有人赚那么多吗012---Any of you guys make that?
嫁给我012---Marry me.
我不懂  戒指整晚都在我房里  如果她没拿012---I don't get it. It was in my room all night. If she didn't take it...
我没拿  你没拿  那是谁拿的012---...and I didn't take it and you didn't take it. Then who did?
安静  我们在想事情012---Shh. We're trying to think.
你怎么会知道是假痛012---I still don't get how you know when it's false labor.
你有看到宝宝吗012---Well, do you see any babies?
你感觉如何  还好吧  大概012---How do you feel? Okay, I guess. I mean...
我不知道012---I don't know.
大概是我知道快要结束了012---I guess I know it's going to be over soon so...
那不是很好吗012---But isn't that a good thing?
你说你受够了  我知道012---I mean, you said you were sick of this. I know.
只是一般怀孕完之后012---It's just usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing...
就是该当妈妈了012---...then you get to do the mom thing.
我却穿着皮裤  喝龙舌兰酒012---I'm gonna be, you know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
有些妈妈也会那样012---Some moms do that.
那样更悲惨012---Yeah, that's even sadder.
我知道这么做的后果012---Look, I know what I got myself into, you know?
但他们现在在我肚子里  我好像012---It's just that now that they're in me, it's like...
我好像了解他们一样012---It's like I know them, you know, and...
把他们送走  我会很难受012---It just not gonna be easy when, you know, these little babies have to go away.

或着他们不乖时骂他们012---Or yelling at them when they're bad.
或在他们吵个不停时012---You know? Or deciding to put them on Ritalin...
喂他们吃立得宁012---...when they just won't calm down.
知道吗012---You know?
他们离家出走会来找你012---You're gonna be the one they come to when they run away from home.

要是他发生什么事  乔伊  兽医说手术很简单012---If anything should happen to him... Joey, the vet said it's a simple procedure.
所以呢  搞不好会出错  要是他没撑过来呢012---So? Things can go wrong. You don't know. What if he doesn't make it?
他会的  乔伊  要是没有呢012---He will, Joe. Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
他是这么乖巧012---He's such a good duck.
我好担心他012---I'm so worried about him.
有人掉了戒指吗012---Somebody lose a ring? Aah!
天哪  谢谢你  谢谢012---Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you so much. Aah!
鸭子怎么样了012---How's the duck?
他很好  正在休息  你们可以去见他012---He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
太好了012---Oh. Great.
听着  罗斯  谢谢你这么好的脾气012---Oh, hey, listen, Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
没关系  当然有关系012---No, that's all right. No, it's not.
你找我当伴郎  我却让你失望012---I mean, you made me your best man and I totally let you down.
少来了  又不是你的错  当然是012---Hey, come on. It's not your fault. Yeah, it is.
你就不会弄丢戒指012---You wouldn't have lost the ring, right?
知道吗  罗斯  你开始就是对的012---You know what? Ross, you were right from the start.
他才应该当你的伴郎  不  应该你当012---He should be your best man. No, you should.
别吵了  嘿  嘿012---Look, don't argue with me. Hey, hey, hey.
伴郎是我选的012---I get to choose my best man.
你们两个我都要012---I want both you guys.
真的012---Really?
你们都应该陪我站在台前012---Both you guys should be up there with me.
你们是我的012---I mean, you two are my...
有一个好朋友就012---I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
谢了012---Well, thanks, man.
我去那边看看012---I got to go check something, okay?
真孩子气   都够爱哭的012---What a baby. Total wuss.
大家动作快点  4小时后的航班012---You guys, hurry up. The flight leaves in four hours.
打的还要时间  路上可能会堵车  飞机还可能提前起飞012---It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early.

做好一件事  就打个勾勾012---You know, you do a good thing, you get a check.
这是我妈的习惯   我从不觉得很怪啊012---My mom does it. I never realized it was weird.
我妈都把头塞进烤箱里012---Hey, my mom used to put her head in the oven, so...
其实只有一次  但觉得蛮怪异的012---Actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.

护照呢012---You got your passport?
衣橱第三个抽屉里   弄丢就糟了012---Yeah, in my third drawer of my dresser. You don't wanna lose that.
快去012---Oh. There it is.
老友记  第四季  第23集  罗斯的婚礼（上）012---Friends  S04E23  The One With Ross's Wedding Parts I

伦敦  宝贝012---Yeah. Cheerio. London, baby.
我绝对不会烦  伦敦  宝贝012---Because that's not gonna get annoying. London, baby!
你知道吗  我错了012---Oh, you know what? I was wrong. Ha, ha.
行  人都到了  我们该走了012---Well, we're all here. I guess we should get going.
我真想过去拥抱你一下012---Oh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug...
祝你婚礼一切顺利  但是我起不来012---...and wish you luck on your wedding, but I can't get up.
我过来拥抱你好了  太好了  能不能帮我把报纸带过来012---Oh, I'll come hug you. Great, can you bring me the newspaper?
好啊012---Yeah.
快快乐乐的结婚吧   谢谢012---Have a great wedding. Oh. Thanks.
钱德  我也想抱你  嘿012---Hey, Chandler, I wanna hug you too. Hey.
顺便去你家餐台  把我的书拿来012---And you might as well bring me my book. It's on the counter in your apartment.
我们要走了  玩得开心点012---So we're off. Have fun.
谢谢012---Thanks. Oh.
你居然不能去012---Oh. I can't believe you're not gonna be there.
是啊012---Oh, I know.
去嘛  你为什么不能去  什么012---So come. Why don't you come? What?
去伦敦  一起去  拜托  我会很高兴012---To London. Come to London. Please? It would mean so much to me.
我要忙  对不起012---Yeah, well, I gotta work. I'm sorry.
为什么不能请两天假  我不行  我说过了012---Why can't you take a couple of days off? Because I can't. I told you. No, I can't.
这是我的婚礼012---This is my wedding.
真的来不及了  走走走012---All right, you know what? Now we are late. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
好吧  回来再让你看录影带012---Fine, you'll watch it on video when we get back.
菲比  你的书书  苏苏012---Here you go, Phoebe. Here you go, Phoebo, Phoobala, Phobayboo.
你啊012---You. Ha, ha.
走吧   菲比再见012---All right, let's go. Bye, Pheebs.
再见  菲比  再见012---Bye. Bye, Pheebs.
再见012---Mwah. Goodbye. Mwah.
再见  旅途愉快012---Bye. Safe flight.
伦敦  宝贝012---London, baby.
天哪  你要抱抱吗012---Oh, God. Oh. Do you need a hug?
你不必拿东西给我012---You don't have to bring me anything.
钱德   做点动作012---All right, Chandler, do something.
来啊  做动作啊  我在做啊  我正在当你不存在012---Come on, do something. I am. I'm ignoring you.
好吧  你来拍我吧  好012---Okay, I'm gonna be the on-camera guy. All right.
第一站   西敏寺012---First stop, Westminster Abbey.
那是什么  伦敦啊  宝贝012---Oh, what the hell is that? That's London, baby.
好  饭店在这里012---All right, the hotel's here.
等一下  不对  我们要去…012---Wait. No, we wanna go...
不对012---No.
我知道了012---I know.
我得站到地图上去012---I'm gonna have to go into the map.
要是里面有个小钱德  踩死他012---Okay, if you see a little version of me in there, kill it.
我知道了012---I got it.
走吧012---Here we go.
听着  我们不是要这样逛大街吧012---Okay, listen, listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time, are we?
你害的我又乱了012---Oh, man, you made me lose it.
那时候还不到10点012---…and that was all before 10 o'clock.
厨师告诉我说用基辅鸡肉代替龙嵩叶鸡肉012---The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
然后花店又说没有郁金香了012---The florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips.
然后大提琴手得了  腕关节综合症012---Oh, and then the cellist has carpal tunnel syndrome...
喔 喔 喔   艾蜜莉  亲爱的  好吗012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Emily, honey. Okay?
好吧  我也去你妈的  什么012---Well, up yours too. What?
不  这是暂停的意思  对不起012---No, no. That's "time-out." Sorry.
放轻松   一切都会很美好012---Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay?
走吧  走吧012---Come on, come on.
基辅鸡012---Chicken kiev? Mm-hm.
听起来最后这道菜很美味吧012---Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
是啊  但鲑鱼一类的东西012---I know, but something like salmon would just...
比鸡肉看起来档次更高一点012---It would be so much more elegant than chicken.
而且你还不用担心会感染沙门氏菌012---And you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.
真想赶快看到婚礼场地012---So, I can't wait to see where you're getting married.
是啊  没错  那里很美  她父母就在那里结婚012---Yeah. Yeah. Yes, This place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
还是不敢相信  它居然要被拆了012---So, can't believe they're tearing it down.
你绝对没看过那么美的房子012---It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see.
就在…012---I mean, it's over...
天哪012---Oh, my God.
还不错012---It's nice.
我的天哪012---Oh. Oh, my God.
怎么会这样  我们怎么办012---How can this be happening? What are we gonna do?
放心  不会有问题的012---It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
怎么会没问题  说得也是012---How is it gonna be all right? Uh-huh, I see that.
我跟拿铲子的那个人聊过了  知道怎么回事了012---Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
怎么回事  提前了几天拆除012---What? What? They tore it down a few days early.
漂亮012---All right.
西敏寺012---Westminster Abbey.
绝对是我见过最美的寺012---Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.
嘿012---Hey.
好012---Okay.
钱德   你觉得西敏寺如何012---What do you think of the abbey, Chandler?
很宏伟   他们正打算改名012---Oh, I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, They're thinking of changing the name of this place.
真的  改成什么  改成 "摄像机收起来"012---Really? To what? To "Put the Camera Away."
老兄  你可以改叫 "西敏寺神经病"了012---Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
别起来  你需要什么  没什么012---Honey, don't get up. What do you need? Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
没关系  我就是留下来照顾你的  需要什么  什么都行012---Come on. I'm here to take care of you. What do you need? Anything.
好吧  屁股夹到内裤了012---Okay, I have a wedgie.
那你还是自己解决012---Okay, that is all you.
中午想吃什么012---So, what do you want for lunch?
我不知道012---Oh, I don't know.
我们是得吃饭  是啊  我得吃啊012---I guess we have to eat. Yeah, I do.
怎么了012---What's the matter?
我应付罗斯的方式真差劲啊012---I'm just bummed the way I left things with Ross.
真后悔骗他说我要上班的012---I wish I didn't lie to him about having to work.
他好像很气我012---He seemed so mad at me.
别太责备自己  要是我还爱的人要结婚012---Ah, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was...
还爱的人  是啊012---Still in love with? Yeah.
我才没有爱着罗斯呢012---I'm not in love with Ross.
是没有  那很好012---No, no. Good.
我也没有012---Yeah, me neither.
菲比  我不去是因为他是我的旧情人012---Phoebe, I'm not going to Ross' wedding, because he's my ex-boyfriend...
去了会很不自在012---...and that would be really uncomfortable.
不是因为我还爱着他  我跟大家一样喜欢罗斯012---Not because I'm still in love with him. Hey, I like Ross as much as the next guy.
我对他的确有感情  但那不是爱012---You know, clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love.
我对罗斯还有爱的感觉吗012---You know, I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross?
有012---Yeah.
我一直都有012---I have continuing feelings of love.
但那并不表示我还爱着他012---But that doesn't mean that I'm still in love with him.
我对他还有性趣  但我当然爱他012---You know, I mean, I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.
天哪012---Oh, my God. Oh, my...
你为什么不告诉我012---Why didn't you tell me?
我们以为你知道  我们012---We thought you knew. We?
对  我们都知道  还经常在聊012---Yeah, we all know. We talk about it all the time.
你们都知道  罗斯知道吗012---You all know? Does Ross know?
不  罗斯什么都不知道012---Oh, no. Ross doesn't know anything.
你们居然没告诉我012---Oh. I cannot believe you didn't tell me.
我们以为你知道  那么明显012---Because we thought you knew. It's so obvious.
告诉你等于告诉摩妮卡012---God, it would be like, you know, telling Monica:
"喂  你很爱干净喔"012---"Hey," you know, "you like things clean."
你好012---Hi.
先生想买什么012---So, what are you fine gentlemen in the market for?
有围巾  明信片  你看012---We've got scarves, souvenir postcards. Check this out, huh?
棒及了012---Oh, yeah.
这个就对了  你觉得呢012---That's the stuff. What do you think?
我不必买印着  "与笨蛋同行" 的T恤了012---Well, I'm not gonna have to buy that "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
我喜欢  钱给你012---Well, I like it. Here you go.
你不是来真的吧  你丢我的脸丢得还不够吗012---All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
我丢你的脸012---Oh, I embarrass you?
我假装不认识你  无法回答012---How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
他是在嫉妒  伦敦人都在戴012---He's just jealous. You'll fit right in. All Londoners wear them.
是吗  那这里怎么没人戴012---Oh, really? Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?
他们都是观光客012---They're all tourists.
那好吧  如果你要当街戴着那顶帽子012---All right, look, if you insist on wearing that in public, you know...
下午你就自己去逛着玩吧012---...you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
是吗012---Oh, yeah?
如果要在你和帽子之间做选择  我选择帽子012---If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat, I choose the hat.
够英明  谢了012---Good choice. Thanks.
好吧  够了  就这样012---Okay, look. All right, that's it, okay?
我要走了  我不想再丢脸了012---I'm out of here. I'm not gonna be embarrassed anymore.
哈罗  嘿012---Hello? Hey.
我跟你爸谈过  你猜怎么012---I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?
他觉得可以另外找到场地012---He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding
不必了  难道  你找到地方了012---We don't have to. What, you found a place?
没有  但摩妮卡和我讨论过012---No, but Monica and I were talking...
礼堂被拆  我的确很烦012---...and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down...
结果她建议  把婚期延后012---...and she suggested that we just put the wedding off for a bit.
她说什么  她说如果我不喜欢012---She said what? She said if I'm not happy...
临时找个地方  我们就应该延期012---...getting married somewhere we can find in a day, well, we should just postpone it.
延期012---Postpone it? Heh.
艾蜜莉  你觉得摩妮卡知道  我们爸妈花了多少钱吗012---Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent on this wedding?
你觉得我妹的那个小脑袋能够理解012---Huh? Do you think my sister's teeny, tiny little brain comprehends...
大家特地腾出时间012---...that people took time out of their lives...
大老远飞来这里吗012---...to fly thousands of miles to be here? Huh?
这么做不对的012---This isn't right.
我知道  大家会失望012---I realize that people are going to be disappointed.
我相信等我们一切就绪了  他们还是会回来的012---I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
我不能叫人家这么做  你会吗012---Well, I can't ask people to do that. Would you ask people to do that?
别拿你的裤子指着我012---Don't you point your pants at me.
我们别无选择012---We have no choice.
像样一点的场地一定没空档012---Anywhere that's half-decent will have been booked months ago.
你不懂吗  罗斯  这是我们的婚礼012---Ross, don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
我只知道延期是不可能的012---The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option.
要结就现在结012---This is when we're getting married.
你的意思是  要么就不结了  不  我是说现在就结012---What are you saying, it's now or never? No, I'm saying it's now.
否则呢   我没说 "否则"012---Or? There's no "or" in mine.
这条裤子是怎么搞的012---What is wrong with these pants?
不是裤子的问题  是你自己穿反了012---It's not the pants. It's you who's backwards.
要是你不懂这件事对我有多重要012---And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me...
或许  我们就根本不该结婚012---well then, perhaps we shouldn't be getting married at all.
艾蜜莉  等一下  别走012---Emily, no. Wait, stop. Emily, please...
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
血拼完有没有舒服一点嘛012---So did shopping help you feel any better about Ross?
舒服的话曼哈顿的店都不够012---Manhattan does not have enough stores.
我能帮你忘了他012---Well, I think I can help you get over him.
真的  对012---You can? Yeah.
拿几张罗斯的照片012---I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross...
一小片巧克力012---...and, um, a small piece of chocolate...
和一杯温水来012---...and a glass of tepid water.
是不是要跟墓地的土装在一起012---Ooh. Is this one of those things where you throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt...
挂在面北的树上012---...and hang it from a north-facing tree?
要是你也在打嗝的话012---Uh, only if you have the hiccups too.
照片是给你的  其它的是我要的012---The pictures are for you. The chocolate and water's for me.
我只是不想起来012---I just didn't feel like getting up.
我给你看一张罗斯的照片  好012---Okay. I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross, okay...
你要去想他不好的地方012---...and you're going to remember all the bad things about him, all right?
专心想他的缺点  没问题012---Really focus on his flaws. I can do that.
原来交往的时候我就这样012---Certainly did that while we were going out. Heh.
好012---Okay. Mm.
首先我想先声明  我爱罗斯012---Before we get started, I just wanna say, for the record, I love Ross.
他真的好棒012---I think he's such a great guy.
好  闭上眼睛012---Okay. Now close your eyes.
想像你跟罗斯在一起012---And imagine that you're with Ross. Mm-hm.
想像你在亲他012---Okay, and imagine that you're kissing him. Mm-hm.
你的手在他的身上游移012---You're running your hands all over his body.
你的手抚弄他的头发012---And then you run your hands through his hair...
但是好恶心  是某种油012---...but, oh, ew, gross, it's some kind of grease, it's... Ugh.
我不知道012---I don't know.
他的头发没那么困扰我012---I don't know, his hair never bothered me that much.
那应该算是硬而不是油012---And you know, it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
好吧  难度比我想的还高012---Okay. This is gonna be harder than I thought.
试试厌恶疗法好了012---Um, ahem. Let's try some aversion therapy.
好  好吧  怎么样  好012---Okay. All right. Okay? All right.
看着照片  好012---Look at the picture. Okay.
好  然后012---All right, and, um...
现在觉得怎样  我开始不喜欢你了012---Okay. How do you feel now? Well, I like you less.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
抱歉  我才该抱歉012---Oh. Sorry. No, no, you know what? I'm sorry.
我不该说你丢我的脸012---I really shouldn't have said you that were embarrassing me.
那样很过份012---That really wasn't cool.
如果能让你高兴一点   不过我今天过得可没意思了012---And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
我也是012---Me too.
真的  当然不是012---Yeah? No!
这是我最兴奋的一天012---I had the best day ever.
伙计  看看这个012---Dude, check this out.
告诉我朋友  你喜欢我的帽子012---Say hi to my friend and tell him you like my hat.
好  你朋友叫什么  钱德012---Okay, so, what's your friend's name? Oh. Chandler.
钱德  你好012---Hi, Chandler.
那不是…012---That's... That's...
天啊  那是佛姬  宝贝012---Oh, my God. That's Fergie, baby!
乔伊说你不喜欢他的帽子  但我觉得挺时髦的012---Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kind of dashing.
你怎么会  什么时候012---When did you...? How...?
我那时正在想办法去白金汉宫012---I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
我站到了地图上   然后012---So I'm in my map and...
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
听说你和艾蜜莉谈过012---I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
没错  谈过012---Ha, ha. Yes, I did.
不客气012---And you are welcome.
是吗012---Am I?
是你提议把婚期延后的012---And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
我要上厕所  等我012---I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Wait up.
既然你这么会解决问题  问题来了012---Hey, hey, since you're the fix-it lady, here's a pickle:
当新娘说她不想结婚时  你怎么办012---What do you do when the bride says she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all?
她这么说  对012---She said that? Yeah.
为什么  我不知道012---Why? I don't know.
我说为了礼堂被拆就延期  实在太蠢了012---I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone...
然后  她就发火了012---...and she, like, flipped out.
天哪   你比我还笨012---Oh, my God. You're even dumber than I am.
什么012---Excuse me?
你筹备这次婚礼多久了012---Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
记不清了  1个月吧012---I don't know. A month?
艾蜜莉可能从5岁就在计划了012---Emily has probably been planning it since she was 5.
从她第一次把枕头套  戴在头上开始012---Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off her head.
女生都这样012---That's what we did.
我们梦想在一个完美的场地012---We dreamed about the perfect wedding.
办一场完美的婚礼012---In the perfect place.
有一个完美的四层结婚蛋糕012---With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.
上面有木偶小人012---With the little people on top.
但最重要的是…012---But the most important part...
有个完美的男人012---...is that we had the perfect guy...
能理解这一切  对我们有多重要012---...who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
这我都不知道012---I had no idea.
我以为你披枕头套  是在学 "飞天修女"012---That pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing The Flying Nun.
有时候是这样的啦012---Sometimes we were.
别哭了012---Come on.
帮我想想办法012---You gotta help me figure out what to do.
好吗   好012---Okay? All right.
走吧012---Come on.
刚才的气氛可真紧张  是啊012---Whoa. Pretty intense, huh? Yeah.
希望罗斯不会以为  我们是怕尴尬才进厕所012---Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
希望他就是这么想的012---I hope he did.
喂   菲比  我是乔伊012---Hello? Hey, Pheebs, it's Joey.
乔伊   嘿012---Hey, Joey. Hey. Ooh, ooh.
我在地铁看到一个很像你的人012---I just saw someone that looks just like you on the subway.
我正想打招呼  又想到他不会在乎他长得像你012---I was gonna go over and say hi, but then I figured he doesn't care he looks like you.
你说这些花了我4块钱了012---That just cost me 4 bucks.
我打来问问小鸡小鸭好不好012---I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing.
他们跟菲比阿姨玩得很开心012---They're having a great time with Aunt Phoebe.
瑞秋阿姨没什么用012---Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.
你想我吗012---So do you miss me?
有点  但我玩得太高兴了012---Kind of, but I've just been having way too much fun.
你还没想家012---Oh, so you're not homesick yet?
没有  应该没有012---No, I don't think so.
我们七个都很想你012---All right, well, the seven of us miss you.
哪七个  我  瑞秋012---Who's seven? Well, you know, me, Rachel...
鸡  鸭  3个宝宝012---...the birds, the babies.
宝宝也想我012---Aw, the babies miss me?
彼萨来了  你们趁我不在叫彼萨012---Ooh, pizza guy's here. What? You ordered pizza without me?
对  但我们想着你  所以特地点了乔伊特餐012---Yeah, but we were thinking about you. We ordered the Joey Special.
两个披萨012---Two pizzas?
对  我得挂了  再聊  等等  你们叫哪家的012---Yeah. Okay, gotta go. Talk to you later. Wait, wait. Where did you get it from?
摩妮卡  你带我来这里干什么  等着瞧012---Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?! You'll see.
我跟你讲  我们不会结婚了012---I tell you, this wedding is not gonna happen.
罗斯012---Oh, Ross.
好  想像一下更多的灯火  少一点砖瓦012---Okay? But imagine a lot more lights, okay, and, you know, fewer bricks...
还有鲜花蜡烛012---...and flowers and candles.
乐队可以摆在这里012---Okay, and the musicians, they can go over here, okay?
椅子可以朝这边   然后…012---And the chairs, they can face this way and...
你讲012---You go.
不过要是你不喜欢  我们就改地点012---But if you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place...
改时间012---...any other time.
真的  没关系  你高兴就好012---Really, it's fine. Whatever you want.
这样很完美012---It's perfect.
我不知道  要是下雨   那就淋湿吧012---And, I don't know, if it starts to rain... Well, then we'll get wet.
我连男朋友都没有012---I don't even have a date.
菲比  什么012---Pheebs? Yeah?
你记得饲料在哪里吗012---Do you remember where the duck food is?
记得  在男生那边的水槽下面  怎么了012---Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment, under the sink. Why?
因为我要去伦敦012---Because I'm going to London.
什么  什么叫你要去伦敦012---What? What do you mean, you're going to London?
我得告诉罗斯我爱他012---Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
保重  等我回来再生012---Now, honey, you take care, and you don't have those babies till I get back. Mwah.
你不能去  罗斯爱的是艾蜜莉012---Rachel, you can't go. Ross loves Emily.
我知道  我知道  但我得告诉他我的感觉012---I know, I know, I know he does, but I have to tell him how I feel.
他应该知道所有的状况  好做出决定012---He deserves to have all of the information. Then he can make an informed decision.
不会吧  你去是希望他说012---That's not why you're going. You're going because you hope he'll say:
"我也爱你  忘掉那个英国妹了"012---"Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget about that British chippie."
你觉得他会吗012---Do you think he will?
不会   因为他爱那个英国妹012---No, because he's in love with the British chippie.
你去了只会把他搞乱  毁了他的婚礼012---Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding.
太迟了  你错过机会了012---You know? It's too late. You missed your chance.
抱歉  我知道你一定很难受012---I'm sorry. I know this must be really hard.
但已经结束了012---But it's over.
不  有人说 "我愿意" 才算结束012---You know what? No. It's not over until someone says "I do."
我愿意  我愿意  我愿意012---I do. I do! I do!
反正我也追不上你  谁让我怀了一窝宝贝呢012---Yeah, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
《老友记》 前情提要012---Previously on Friends:
你居然不能去  是啊012---I can't believe you won't be there. I know.
为什么不能请两天假012---Why can't you take a couple of days off?
我不行  这是我的婚礼012---Because I can't. This is my wedding.
真想赶快看到婚礼场地  她父母就在那里结婚012---So,I can't wait to see this place you're getting married! Emily's parents got married here.
你绝对没看过那么美的房子  就在012---It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. It's right over...
天哪012---Oh, my God!
我只知道延期是不可能的012---The only thing I understand is postponing is not an option.
我跟你讲  我们不会结婚了012---I tell you, this wedding is not gonna happen.
要是你不喜欢  我们就改地点  改时间  真的没关系012---If you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place or any other time. Really, it's fine.
这样很完美012---It's perfect.
我要去伦敦  什么012---I'm going to London. What?
有人说 "我愿意" 才算结束012---It's not over until someone says, "I do."
我愿意  我愿意  我愿意012---I do! I do! I do!
瑞秋  不012---Rachel, no!
华森公馆012---The Waltham residence.
是艾蜜莉的父母家吗012---Hi, is this Emily's parents' house?
我是管家012---This is the housekeeper speaking.
还有  小姐  讲电话不能这样讲012---And, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.
先表明身份012---First one identifies oneself...
再请你想找的人过来012---...and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
我是菲比布非012---Um, this is Phoebe Buffay.
我是想麻烦你012---I was wondering, please...
如果不是很麻烦的话012---...if it's not too much trouble, please...
我能和艾蜜莉华森小姐通话吗012---...um, might I speak with Miss Emily Waltham, please?
华森小姐去排练餐会了012---Miss Waltham is at the rehearsal dinner.
嘲弄别人的口音是不礼貌的  再见012---And it is not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
不  我会有礼貌  我发誓012---No, no! I'll be nice, I swear.
可以把电话给我吗012---Could you just give me their number?
我恐怕没有权利泄露这个信息012---I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
有人正要去破坏婚礼  我得警告他们012---Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody,
你不给我号码  我就杀到伦敦012---alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there...
把你一脚瑞到新咕噜肯夏去012---...and I'll kick your snooty ass all the way to New Gloukenshire!
喂  喂012---Hello? Hello? Oh!
她知道我说到做到012---Ooh, she knew I could kick her ass.

我跟罗斯认识很久了  他第一次交女朋友我都知道012---Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend.
