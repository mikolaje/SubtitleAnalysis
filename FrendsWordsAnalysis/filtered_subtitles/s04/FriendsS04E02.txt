我心中那个胖女孩真的很想去  这是我欠她的012---And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this.
我从不让她尽情的吃012---I never let her eat.
你去吧  真的012---You go out with him. Really?
如果可以  你能不能丢下他去跟别人做爱012---Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?

我要打给住在(海边)的妈妈012---Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.
我说反了012---I just spelled the wrong word.
是我疯了  还是有人也觉得菲比的妈像一只猫012---So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
罗斯  别提了  拜托012---Ross, don't start. Come on.
你们真的相信  那只猫是一个女人变的012---You can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
