在哔声后012---Leave.
在哔声后  那个我说过了012---But I just said "leave."
我知道  因为你都分到好的字012---Yeah, I know, because you have all the good words.
而我呢  "这是"  "和"  还有"留言"  我不要012---What do I get? I get "it’s," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
菲比  别闹了  好  那我们交换012---Phoebe, that's silly. All right. So let's switch.

请慢着  你是怎么弄的012---Pleas-Wait. How did you do that?
什么012---What?
你不是普通角色   对吧012---Oh, you're no ordinary roommate, are you?
菲比  待会再录好吗  我想在天黑前去慢跑012---Phoebe, come on, can we finish this later? I wanna go running before it gets dark.
你也一起来跑嘛  真的012---Why don't you come with me? Really?
对   一定很好玩的012---Yeah, oh, it'll be fun.
去公园跑步  当做室友间第一次联络感情012---We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first, you know, roommate-bonding thing.
好  我们去跑步012---Okay, let's go running!
而且  那里还有帅哥  那我们就朝那边跑012---Yeah, and there's cute guys there. Let's run towards them!
好012---0Kay.
你等我一下012---Wait just one more second.

老友记  第六季  第7集  菲比跑步012---Friends  S06E07  The One Where Phoebe Runs
我刚看完一本很棒的书012---So I just finished this fascinating book. Hmm.
到了2030年  有些电脑012---By the year 2030, there'll be computers...
能执行跟人脑一样多的命令012---...that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain.
所以  理论上  你可以把思想记忆012---So, theoretically, you could download...
下载到这种电脑上012---...your thoughts and memories into this computer...
然后以机器的形态长生不老012---...and live forever as a machine.
我刚发现我能睁着眼睛睡觉012---And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
把箱子钉在地上真是聪明012---Honey, it was a great idea, nailing the boxes to the floor.
我没把箱子钉在地上   所以你可以搬走了012---I didn't nail the boxes to the floor. Oh, so you can move them.
可以  我这就搬   罗斯有个很好听的电脑故事012---Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
嘿  大家好   这是吉宁012---Hey, everybody. Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine.
她是我的新室友012---She's gonna be my new roommate.
你好012---Hi. Hi.
她要来跟我住012---And she's gonna live with me!
很高兴认识你  吉宁012---It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
勒夸  吉宁勒夸012---Lecroix. Janine Lecroix.
我都不知道  好好听的姓啊012---I didn't know that. What a pretty last name.
你是哪里人012---So, uh, where are you from?
澳洲人  两星期前刚到012---Australia. I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
来自于南半球  对012---From the land down under? Yeah.
这个我也不知道012---I didn't know that either.
你做哪一行012---So, what do you do?
我是个舞者  你是个舞者012---I'm a dancer. You're a dancer?
她是个舞者012---She's a dancer.
我要去整理东西了  我帮你开门012---Well, I think I'll go and unpack. Here, let me--
乔伊   在012---Joey? Yeah?
你叫她搬来之前有先面试过吗012---Did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
有  当然有啊012---Of course I did. Uh-huh.
你到底问了些什么012---What exactly did you ask her?
你什么时候可以搬来012---When can you move in?
谢谢你把她带到我们身边012---Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
好个大美人012---Unbelievable.
你也喜欢她  钱德012---Oh. Oh, so you like her too, Chandler?
你看这堆箱子012---Hey, look at all the boxes.
我好想赶快约她012---I cannot wait to ask her out.
等等  乔伊  乔伊  你不能约她012---Wait a minute, Joey. Joey, you can't ask her out.
她是你的室友  那样的话太复杂了012---She's your roommate. It'll be way too complicated.
没错  千万不要012---Yeah, man, don't do it.
你约了她   我就不能约她了012---I mean, if you date her, then I can't date her.
你之前跟一个叫唐娜的交往  后来分手了012---Think about it. Remember when you were going out with Donna and you broke up...
记得你们在超市巧遇的尴尬吗012---...remember how horrible it was when you bumped into her at the supermarket?
没错012---Oh, God, yeah.
想像你住在超市里012---Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
好啊012---0Kay.
不   不   不是012---No, no. Oh. Oh.
你说得对   那样很不好   我不能约她012---You're right. I don't want that. I can't date her.
最好也别跟她调情  住得这么近012---And you'd better watch the flirting too, because in close quarters...
太可怕了  可能会出事012---...it could be trouble. Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.
太难了  毕竟美女当前   我很难不打情骂俏012---I mean, it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
我老是在你面前  你也没怎样么012---Heh. Well, you're around me all the time, and you don't flirt.
有点难过  是吧012---A little sad about that, sweetie?
我要绑鞋带  你先跑  我就来012---I have to tie my shoes, so you go ahead. I'll catch up.
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
拜托   那哪叫跑步啊   快点012---Come on, that's not running. Let's go!
我是说真的  她跑步的时候012---You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs...
就像大嘴蛙012---...she looks like a cross between Kermit the Frog...
和生化机器人合体012---...and the Six Million Dollar Man.
摩妮卡以前好喜欢他012---Monica had such a crush on him. Ha, ha.
她睡觉之前都会亲他的海报012---She used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
我也会012---I used to do that too.
你有他的专辑 《全身绿色的烦恼》吗012---Oh,my God. Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
摩妮卡012---Oh, Mon.
所以菲比的姿势很怪012---So Phoebe runs weird, huh?
对  而且她还想再去跑012---Yeah. And you know what? And I know she's gonna want to run again.
我跟她住在一起  躲不掉012---I don't know how to get out of it. I mean, I live with her.
你就实话实说嘛012---Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
你说得对  我应该跟她直说012---You're right. You're right. I should just tell her the truth.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
菲比  摩妮卡把我绊倒了   我再也不能跑步了012---Hey, Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don't think I can ever run again, ever.
为什么  你为什么要绊倒她012---Why? Why would you do that?
我不知道012---I don't know.
瑞秋  抱歉害你两个脚踝受伤012---Rachel, I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
只有一个  等着瞧012---Ankle. We'll see.
好  东西都拿出来了012---Okay. I am officially unpacked.
多谢帮忙012---Thanks for helping me, man.
乔伊012---JOe?
看来他回家了012---Well, I guess Joey went home.
看  还有一个箱子没拆012---Oh, and look, there is still one box that I have to unpack.
你被骗了012---I got you.
天哪  我差点被吓出心脏病012---Oh, my God, you almost gave me a heart attack.
我想笑想得好辛苦012---It was so hard not to laugh, I'll tell you.
很像一回事嘛012---Hey, the place looks great.
不赖吧012---Yeah, not bad, right?
摩妮卡今天要加班   我要把这里打扫得一尘不染012---You know what? Monica's working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless.
还有  还有012---You know what else I'm gonna do?
我还要下楼去  买花送她012---I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers.
谁不想跟我住012---Now, who would not want to live with me?
我不想012---I don't.
我想跟性感的澳洲舞者住012---No, I want to live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
情况如何  你能不打情骂俏吗012---How's that going, though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
目前  还可以  但是好累啊012---Yeah, so far. Yeah. But it's tough, you know?
我的调情能量一直在累积  无处发泄012---I've got all this built-up flirting energy, and I don't know how to get rid of it.
你好吗012---How you doing?
天哪012---Oh, man.
抱歉   客厅比较宽012---Sorry. There's just more room out here.
不   不是  我只是想到  我也该拉拉筋了012---Oh, no, no, you just, uh, reminded me that I have to do my stretches too.
你应该012---Why don't you try to be...? Aah!
怎么了  没事012---What's wrong? Uh, nothing.
你不要碰我012---I just-I didn't want you to touch me...
我拉筋拉得全身都是汗012---...because I'm all sweaty from the workout. Ha, ha.
我去洗个澡012---I'm gonna hit the shower.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
抱歉在浴室晾衣服012---Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there.
我的丁字裤很娇贵  不能烘干012---It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
啊嗯012---Aah! Hi.
没错  是我012---Oh, yeah, uh-huh, it's me.
我看到你抄着慢跑鞋就溜出来了012---I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.
你骗我   好自己跑步012---You lied so you could run by yourself.
不是  菲比  我没有  我是012---No, Phoebe, no. I was-No.
我只是跑跑看看012---I was actually just checking...
看看我012---...to see...
能不能跑   结果还可以012---...if I could run. And I can.
拜托  瑞秋  我又不是白痴012---Please, Rachel, I'm not an idiot.
不  等等  菲比012---No, wait. Phoebe?
同居真的会让人越来越像012---Wow. Couples who live together do start to look alike.
摩德012---So, Mondler...
嗯012---Uh...
你在干什么012---What, uh--? What are you doing?
你说呢  我在打扫012---What does it look like? I am cleaning.
你动她的东西有经过她同意吗012---Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
同意  没必要吧  我会把东西都放回去012---Authorizat. I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
完全恢复原状吗012---Put it back exactly where you found it?
当然是  完全恢复原状012---Yes. I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
这种态度对你没有帮助012---Okay, first of all, that attitude is not helping.
她才不会在乎有没有恢复原状012---She won't care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
你是刚认识摩妮卡吗012---Hello? Did you just meet Monica?
她会认同我的体贴的012---She's gonna recognize that I did a nice thing...
而且会感到贴心012---...and appreciate it.
其实  这样也蛮好的012---Huh. No, actually, this will work out well.
等你必须搬回去跟乔伊住012---Because when you have to move back with Joey...
乔伊热辣的新室友就可以跟我来住012---...Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me.
我懂了  你想吓我012---Oh, I see, I see. You're trying to freak me out.
钱德  摩妮卡对这种事有怪癖012---Look, Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right?
相信我  我跟她住了16年  她会捉狂的012---Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She's going to freak out.
天哪  她会压在你身上012---Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you.
她才不会  好吧   我证明给你看012---No, she is not, okay? I'll prove it to you.
我现在就打给她012---I'm gonna call her right now.
电话擦好了012---Phone's done.
摩妮卡  你好吗012---Hi. Hey, Mon. How's it going?
烂透了  什么事都得我自己来012---Terrible. If I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
其他人只会搞砸012---Other people just wreck stuff.
我今晚可能会杀人012---I really think I might kill someone tonight.
别这样  没那么糟吧012---Oh, come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
是非常的糟  想到快见到你了012---It's worse. The only thing getting me through...
我才撑得下去012---...is knowing I'm gonna see you soon.
我搞不好会设法早退  不  不要012---I might get out of here early. No. No, no, no.
不  不  餐厅似乎很需要你012---No, no, it sounds like they need you there.
你跟罗斯在一起吗  一切都很好  再见012---You're just hanging outwith Ross? It's all good. Okay, bye, Mon.
她会宰了我012---She's gonna kill me.
电话放反了012---The phone was facing the other way.
相框应该摆在上面012---And that goes back up there.
知道怎么搞嘛  我们从大型家俱复原开始012---Know what we should do? We should start with the big stuff.
会比较简单  先搬沙发012---That'll be the easiest. So, uh, let's start with the couch.
我没问题012---I got it.
位置好像不对012---Yeah, that doesn't look right.
什么意思  沙发刚好跟毯子对齐012---What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet.
我可以走到这边  轻松的把脚翘在012---Then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on...
好  就这样012---Okay, here's what we do.
那就把沙发往茶几那边推012---We just move the couch closer to the coffee table.
那沙发的背后  就不会跟毯子边缘对齐了012---But then the back of the couch won't line up with the back of the carpet.
那就把茶几往012---Okay, well, here, we'll just, uh, move the coffee table...
沙发那边推012---...closer to the couch.
不  那茶几就不在座位区正中央了012---No, whoa, whoa! But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
那茶几就配不上桌子了  罗斯012---But the coffee table doesn't match the table-Ross.
我该怎么办012---Hi. Look, what am I gonna do?
我不调情  但还像火吸引着飞蛾一样吸引着她  012---I'm not flirting, but still I'm drawing her to me like a moth to a flame.
这里是怎么了012---What the hell's going on over here?
摩妮卡会宰了你012---Monica's gonna kill you.
我需要你们的帮忙012---Look, I need your help, okay?
我得想办法把这个女人吓跑012---I have to do something to repel this woman.
等等   等等012---Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
你们最会把女人吓跑了012---You guys repel women all the time.
我可是结过三次婚012---Hey, I've been married three times.
不  不  我亲眼见识过012---No, no, no, I've seen it happen.
你们跟女人开始都交往得好好的   最后还是都搞砸012---You get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you manage to kill it.
你们的秘诀是什么012---What's your secret?
我们不会把女人吓跑012---Look, we do not repel women,
完全没有这么回事012---Okay? That is completely untrue.
不过  我们确实会012---Oh, yes, we do, my man.
记不记得  大学参加春季舞会012---Remember back in college when we went to that dance...
你瞄上了那个女生  走过去却不停地大谈012---...and you walked right up to that girl you liked and couldn't stop talking...
爱尔兰的马铃薯饥荒012---...about the Irish potato famine?
那你呢  当年也没那么酷012---Yeah, well, what about you? You weren't so hot in college either.
他每次说完话  都会加叭噜锵砰012---After everything he said, he'd go:
摩妮卡也不喜欢  也许我应该改掉012---Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either. Maybe I should stop doing that.
对了  女生都不喜欢我聊科学012---You know what? Girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
不止是女生012---That's not specific to girls.
太好了  还有呢012---This is great. This is great. What else?
她们不喜欢你纠正她们的文法012---They don't like you correcting their grammar.
她们不喜欢你解释你的笑话哪里好笑012---And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
她们不喜欢你一直问她们   喜不喜欢你012---You know, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
天哪  幸好我有摩妮卡  我再也别想谈恋爱了012---Man, I am so lucky I have Monica. I'm never gonna find love again.
嘿012---Hey
菲比  可以跟你谈谈吗  好啊012---Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Sure.
好  我012---Okay. Um, I--
菲比  我只是想跟你道歉012---Phoebe, look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry, okay?
我不擅长处理这类事情012---I handled the situation horribly.
而且我不该骗你012---And I should not have lied to you.
那你应该怎样012---So what should you have done?
我应该跟你说实话012---Well, I should have told you the truth.
就是012---Uh-huh. Which is?
我之所以不想跟你跑步012---Well, you know, the reason that I didn't want to go running with you is...
是因为012---...because, urn...
你跑步的姿势有点012---...well, you know, the way that you run is just a little...
所以呢   很尴尬012---So? Well, it's embarrassing.
别人都当我们是疯子012---People were looking at us like we were crazy.
你干嘛在意呢   因为他们是人012---Why do you care? Because they're people.
你既不认识  也不会再见到的人012---But people that you don't know and will never see again.
但他们依旧是人012---Yes, but still they are people...
有眼睛012---...with eyes.
我就不怕012---Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss:
跟喘气小姐跑步012---Choo, choo, choo, choo.
但是  好吧012---But, oh, okay.
难怪你会觉得跟我跑步很尴尬012---No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.
是啊  你完全放不开012---Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
什么  我哪有放不开啊012---What? I am not uptight. Whoa.
我才不会放不开  老兄012---Listen, I am not uptight, man.
没关系  瑞秋  我不是在批评你  你就是这样的012---That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you. That's just who you are.
对  我就比较自由  从小就是这样跑012---Me, I'm more free, you know? I run like I did when I was a kid...
因为这样才好玩012---...because that's the only way it's fun, you know?
你从来没有往前冲到腿好像快要断了吗012---I mean, didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off...
例如要跑去玩荡秋千012---...you know, like, when you were running towards the swings...
或是玩在躲魔鬼时012---...or running away from Satan?
邻居的狗012---The neighbor's dog.
这盏灯没摆错吧012---Okay, is this lamp in the right place?
管他的  我会把女人吓跑012---Who cares? I repel women.
不  不行  你不能进来012---No, no, no! You can't come in here.
罗斯光着身子的012---Ross is naked!
什么  什么012---What? What?
我不能说我光着身子   她可以看我光着身子012---I couldn't say that I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.
为什么一定要有人光着身子012---Why does anyone have to be naked?
罗斯为什么光着身子012---Why is Ross naked?
我要给钱德看一个东西012---I had to show Chandler something.
光着身体看012---Naked?
对012---Yeah, I uh...
我好像有012---I guess I have, a, uh...
男人病012---A guy problem.
跟钱德的一样吗012---Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
待会儿再回来012---Look, just come back later.
我们搞定了  你再回来012---We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later.
好吧012---Okay. Hey, listen.
浴室洗手台底下  还有钱德的药012---There's still some of Chandler's medicine left under the sink in the bathroom.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
谢天谢地012---Thank God.
你有什么病012---Dude, what'd you have?
没时间了  我们必须专心012---Look, we have no time, okay? We must focus.
要把一切都恢复原状012---We've got to get everything back into its original place.
相册012---The photo album.
相册里一定有一大堆这里的照片012---There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.
我们可以拿来对比012---We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
太好了  好主意012---That's perfect. That's brilliant. Yeah.
说真的  你有什么病012---So really, what did you have?
乔伊  我帮你买了啤酒012---Hey, Joey. I've got some beer for you.
是 "帮谁"吧012---Uh, don't you mean "for whom"?
好012---Sure.
我正想叫彼萨  你要一起吃吗012---Listen, I was gonna order some pizza. You wanna share one?
披萨  我又不是没吃过  叭噜砰锵012---Pizza? It's not like I never had that before.
有什么问题吗012---Is there something wrong?
好吧  好吧012---All right, all right.
我就明说了012---Let's just get this out in the open, okay?
你很火辣012---You're hot.
我很俊俏012---I'm lovable.
显然  我们两个很有感觉012---Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us.
但我们是室友012---But we're roommates...
我们不能走上这条路012---...and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
