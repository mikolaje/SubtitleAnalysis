嗨 嘿012---Hi. Hey.
手续办得还顺利吗012---So, uh, did everything go okay with the annulment?
没问题  都办好了012---Oh, yeah. No problems. It's all taken care of.
罗斯  谢谢你012---Ross, thank you. Ah.
你们要不要去看电影  好啊012---You guys want to go see a movie? Yeah, why not?
我去穿毛衣  好012---Let me get my sweater. Okay.
想不想听件奇怪的事012---You uh, you want to hear something weird?
当然012---Always.
我没去办注销012---I didn't get the annulment.
什么  我们还是夫妻012---What? We're still married.
不要告诉瑞秋  待会见012---Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
你有口香糖吗  有012---Hey, do you have any gum? Oh? Yeah!
等等  罗斯  可以跟你谈一下吗012---Wait! Wait! Hi. Listen, Ross, can I just talk to you for just a second?
但是菲比  电影快开演了012---Oh but Phoebe, we'll be late for the movie.
那里有计程车  计程车012---Oh, there's a cab. Taxi!
太好了012---Oh, that's great.
来得正好  天呐  上车吧012---What timing! My God, huh? There you go.
我们想走着去前面的安洁丽戏院012---Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelika.
安洁丽戏院  开车012---Oh, the Angelika! Go! Go!
你没去注销012---You didn't get the annulment?
我知道  罗斯012---I know. Ross!
我试过  但在律师楼我只听到012---Well, I tried, but when I got to my lawyer's office, all I heard was:
"离婚三次  离婚三次"012---"Three divorces! Three divorces!"
我不希望我的墓碑上刻着  "罗斯盖勒  离婚三次"012---Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read "Ross Geller: Three Divorces."
你不必担心那个  你爱刻什么就刻什么012---Don't worry about that. Your tombstone can say whatever you want.
你可以刻  "罗斯盖勒  婚姻高手"012---It can say, "Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."
我的会刻  "菲比布非  活埋在此"012---You know? Mine's gonna say, "Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."
反正我不能再添一次失败婚姻012---All I know is, I can't have another failed marriage.
所以你要娶个不知情的女生012---So you're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?
女人  抱歉012---Woman. Sorry.
可是  我还没想好要怎么做012---Well, okay, so I don't have it all worked out quite yet.
拜托你先别告诉瑞秋  瑞秋也是我最要好的朋友之一012---Just don't say anything to Rachel. please? Rachel is one of my closest friends.
不过当唯一知情的人感觉不赖  好吧012---Although, being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special. Okay.
停车  菲比012---Okay, Stop, stop! Phoebe?
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rach!
你在搞什么012---What was that?
抱歉  弄错了012---Sorry. Mix-up.
电影好看吗012---Hey, How was the movie?
我还没看012---I haven't seen it yet.
那就赶快去啊  安洁丽戏院  开车  开车012---Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelika! Go. Go!
不012---No!
老友记  第六季  第2集  瑞秋的反应012---Friends  S06E02  The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel
等我们同居  我可以买一台泡泡糖机吗012---Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
当然可以  乔伊不让你买012---Of course. Joey wouldn't let you have one?
对  他对甜食要求特别严012---No, when it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
你想好要怎么说了吗012---Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out? 
还没  我试了好几次  我只能说出 "乔伊  我得"012---No, no, I keep trying. And I can get out "Joey, I have to--"
然后就退缩改成说  "去上厕所"012---Then I lose my nerve and I finish with "--go to the bathroom."
他可能以为我有病012---He may think I'm sick.
我真的得告诉瑞秋了  早死早超生012---I really have to tell Rachel, but I-We just gotta get it over with.
下次见到他们  我们就说  就这么决定012---Y’know, the next time we see them, we'll just tell them. Okay? That's it.
以后你都要这样指使我  是吧012---That's how it'll work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?
差不多  好012---Pretty much. All right.
嘿  摩妮卡 你有没有好一点012---Hey, Monica. Hey, man, you feeling better?
乔伊012---Joey.
我们有事要说012---We have something to tell you.
天哪012---Oh, my God!
你怀孕了012---You're pregnant!
不是  没有吧012---NO! No?
不是  没有012---No. No!
乔伊  是这样的012---Look, Joe, here's the thing. Um--
摩妮卡和我决定  在这里同居012---Monica and I have decided to live together, here.
所以我会搬出来012---So I'm gonna be moving out, man.
哇哦  嘿012---Oh, uh, hey!
我真替你们高兴  恭喜  回见012---I'm really happy for you guys. Congratulations. See you later.
等等  乔伊  你还好吗  很好012---Joey! Joey! Are you okay? Yeah.
我得走了  我还有戏要演012---I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
你们会信才怪012---Like you'd believe that.
真讨厌012---This sucks!
我只是要搬到对面  我保证012---Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall. And I promise you...
摩妮卡和我一分手  我就回去跟你住012---...the minute Monica and I break up, I'm moving right back in.
好  如果你要跟他住012---Okay! Look-look-look, uh, If you're gonna move in with him...
我有责任揭穿他的真面目012---...I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him.
他是个很烂的室友  很烂012---He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
他会忘记012---He, uh, forgets to, um...
他老是012---He always, he always, uh...
我骗谁啊  他最棒了012---Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
菲比  你有看到瑞秋吗  嘿012---Hey, Pheebs. Have you seen Rachel? Hey.
没有  怎样  我有个好消息012---No, why? I have some exciting news.
你怀孕了012---You're pregnant.
不是012---No!
钱德和我决定同居012---Chandler and I are moving in together.
太好了012---Oh, that's good!
不过如果你有宝宝  要叫什么  提示  菲比012---Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
怎么样  嗯012---What's up? Well, um...
钱德和我要住在一起012---Chandler and I are moving in together.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我妹妹和我的死党012---Oh, my little sister and my best friend...
搞在一起012---...shacking up.
太好了  太好了012---That's great. That's great. Mwah.
喂  我也很高兴  好  起来012---Guys, I'm happy too. Okay, come here.
今天真热闹  有人要同居  有人办注销012---Big day, huh? People moving in. People getting annulled.
我要去找瑞秋了  不过…012---Okay, I gotta go find Rachel. But, um--
你们见着她  能不能先灌些坏消息给她  减轻一些冲击012---if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? 
好的  再见012---Okay, bye.
讲给瑞秋听的坏消息012---Hmm. Something bad to tell Rachel.
坏消息  什么是她的坏消息012---Bad news for Rachel. What could that be?
你能不能别再提了012---Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please?
我的人生很难堪  我应该去住在别人的楼梯底下012---All right? My life is an embarrassment. I should just go live under somebody's stairs.
罗斯  根本没那么严重  离婚三次又怎样012---Ross, It's not that big a deal. So you’ll been divorced three times.
你还是会有  和生活约会012---you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates...
才不会  我的约会指数降到谷底012---No! No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.
比我低的只有离婚四次的人012---The only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy...
杀人犯012---...uh, Murderer Guy...
和地质学家012---...and geologists.
罗斯  你别傻了  你可爱聪明又体贴012---Ross, you're being ridiculous. Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet.
这比离婚三次重要多了012---and that is much more important than three stupid divorces.
是吗  你交过离婚三次的男朋友吗012---Oh yeah? Have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times?
这样问不公平  离三次婚的人通常都六十了012---that’s not really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60.
只有你自己在意012---Nobody cares about this except you.
什么难堪啊  都是你在想像012---This embarrassment thing is all in your head.
我证明给你看  过来  干嘛012---Here, I'll show you. Come here. What?
你好  我朋友罗斯即将三度离婚012---Hi. Listen, My friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time.
但你们会和他约会吗012---But wouldn't you date him?
你们稍候  我去找罗斯来012---And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
嘿  我还以为你是瑞秋012---Hey. Agh. Thought you were Rachel.
我哪里露出破绽了  我得赶快告诉她012---What gave me away? I just tell her,
我已经告诉罗斯和菲比  只剩她了012---I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe. She's the only one left.
所以大家都知道了  我们确定要同居了012---Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It's official. We're moving in together.
不能反悔012---No turning back.
你怕吗  怕吗012---Are you scared? Are you?
不怕012---No.
那是我最可怕的声音  你真勇敢012---That was my scariest voice. You're brave.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Ugh. Hey.
今天真惨012---The worst day.
你以为自己终于受重视了  结果老板却叫你拉壳儿012---Y’know, you think finally making progress at work, then your boss calls you Racquel.
我进公司前四年  大家都叫我夏拉拉012---Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap...
是真的  我相信012---Seriously. I believe you.
当时正在开员工大会  当然不会有人纠正她012---So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct.
于是大家都叫我拉壳儿012---So everyone's calling me Racquel.
到了下班前   收发室的人已经叫成洛基了012---By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky.
我还是觉得你很好  很漂亮012---Well, I still think you're very, very nice and very pretty.
什么012---What?
交给你了012---All yours, babe.
瑞秋  过来012---Rachel, come here.
坐012---Have a seat.
好012---0Kay.
听我说  钱德和我012---Listen, urn, Chandler and I...
要一起住012---...are going to live together.
住在这里012---Here.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
真是太棒了012---That's so great!
我真替你们高兴012---I'm so happy for you guys!
真的012---Really?
你真好  还先问我012---And that was so sweet of you to ask.
天哪  我们三个在一起一定会很开心012---Oh my God, The three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
是啊012---Yes, we are.
钱德  你早上不能慢慢冲澡了012---And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning...
因为拉壳儿不能迟到012---...because you know Racquel can't be late.
瑞秋  他会注意的012---Rach. He'll work on that.
好兴奋喔012---Oh. Aw, this is so exciting!
是啊  哇012---Oh, wow.
来敲我的门012---Come and knock on our door
我们等着你012---We'll be waiting for you
看吧   一旦知道内情   就没那么糟了012---See? Once you know the stories, it's not that bad.
第一次  老婆隐瞒性取向  不是我的错012---First marriage: Wife's hidden sexuality. Not my fault.
第二次  宣誓时叫错人012---Second marriage: Said the wrong name at the altar.
有一点点是我的错012---A little my fault.
第三次  怎么能让012---Third marriage: well they really shouldn’t allow you get married...
脸上涂鸦的醉鬼结婚012---...when you're drunk and have writing on your face.
内华达州的错012---Nevada's fault.
你们觉得怎样  谁会没兴趣  谁会不想和他约会012---Okay, So what do you think, ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
离婚无所谓   我会和他约会012---Well the divorces don’t bother me, I'd date him.
但他得先恢复自由身012---But not while he's still married.
那你呢  你也想吧012---Okay, what about you?  wouldn't you want a date?
事实上我再也不约会了012---Actually, I'm not dating at all anymore.
我老是看上对我不好的男人012---See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me,
在我解决这个012---So I decided that until I work that--
好吧  好吧  随便啦012---Good. Good. Whatever.
梅格  你呢012---What about you, Meg?
我也不在意离婚的事012---Well, I don't care about the divorces either.
但我不会和他约会012---But I wouldn't date him.
他显然还爱着这个瑞秋012---It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
什么012---What?
她说  "他显然还爱着这个瑞秋"012---She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
这话太扯了  没错   瑞秋是我的好朋友012---This is crazy. I mean, yes, Rachel is my good friend.
我过去确实爱过她012---And I have loved her in the past...
但现在  她只是我的妻子012---...but now, she is just my wife.
菲比  帮我说句话好吗012---Phoebe, will you help me out here?
你娶她时  我也以为你爱她012---Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
我们喝醉了  喝那么多我连乔伊都会娶012---We were drunk! I would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol.
嘿  比乔伊崔比亚尼烂的人多得是012---Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!
很抱歉  但是你们错了012---I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.
我只是不想离三次婚012---I just don't want to be divorced three times.
没错  他以此为藉口012---Yes, and now he's using this three-divorces reason...
不想离婚  因为他爱她012---...because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her.
我必须说  梅格  干得好012---I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.
好  如果你们这么想012---Okay, Fine! Fine! If this is what you think...
那我就不管了012---...forget about the whole three-divorce thing.
我现在就去找律师办注销012---Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled. Okay?
因为我一点也不爱她012---She means nothing to me.
一点也不爱012---Noth-Nothing!
现在是你的神经质  让我发毛012---Okay, now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
我突然觉得他好有魅力012---I am so attracted to him right now.
我们什么时候要跟瑞秋说实话012---Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
快了012---Soon.
我刚才说不出口  你也看到乔伊多难过012---I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got.
我不忍心伤害  我最好的朋友012---I couldn't do it. She's my best friend.
乔伊也是我最好的朋友012---Joey's my best friend.
我不是吗012---I'm not your best friend?
你自己刚才说012---You just said--!
你当然是012---Of course, you're my best friend.
但请你告诉瑞秋  好吗012---Would you please tell Rachel? Okay.
好啦  至少我现在有准备  好012---All right. At least I'm prepared. Okay.
漂亮  嘿012---Oh, yes. Hey!
嘿  嘿012---Hey, hey
不是给你的  你有不开心吗  现在有了012---They're not for you. Are you upset? I am now.
嘿  室友012---Hey, roomie.
好  再见012---Okay, bye.
瑞秋012---Rash. Ahem.
我有重要的事  要告诉你012---There's something, urn, important I have to tell you.
你怀孕了012---Are you pregnant?
没有  但我要扔掉这件衣服012---No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
刚才有一些误会012---I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
我说钱德和我想住在一起012---When I said that, uh, Chandler and I wanted to live together...
意思是只有我们两个人012---...we meant alone together.
天哪  真好笑  我居然会误会012---Oh, my God. That's funny. I can't believe I did that.
不  亲爱的  都是我不好012---No, sweetie. You know what? This is my fault.
我没说清楚012---I wasn't clear.
真的很抱歉012---I'm really sorry.
听着  你可以慢慢找房子012---Listen, you take as much time as you need to move out, okay?
一点也不用急012---There's absolutely no rush.
好012---0Kay.
好012---0Kay.
你不吃饼干吗012---Don't you want a cookie?
好啊012---Sure.
谢谢012---Thanks.
需要面纸吗012---Do you need a tissue?
莫妮卡  这是哪里的饼干  我做的012---Monica, Where did you get these? I made them.
天哪   真好吃012---Oh, God, they're so yummy!
回到家你人却不在   感觉一定会很奇怪012---God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here.
没有乔伊和钱德家了012---Y’know? No more Joey and Chan's.
没有乔和钱家了012---No more J and C's.
"要不要去乔伊和钱德家"  "不行  已经不在了"012---Want to go to Joey and Chandler's? Can't. It's not there.
我只是搬到对面  我们还是可以跟以前一样012---Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, We can still do all the same stuff.
但以后就不能半夜起来  促膝长谈012---We won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks...
我们的感觉和未来了012---...about our feelings and the future.
我们一次也没做过012---Not once did we do that.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
我告诉瑞秋  我们要自己住了012---So I told Rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us.
是吗  她还好吗012---Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
非常好012---Really well. Yeah.
令人意外的好012---Surprisingly well.
没有哭  也没有生气或难过012---She didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
你很不爽  没把你最好的朋友弄哭012---And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
我只求一点真情流露012---All I'm asking for is just a little emotion.
我们是六年室友啊012---Is that too much to ask after six years?
我们没你们要好吗012---I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! 
没你们开心吗  我不值得她掉几滴泪吗012---I mean, did we not have as much fun? Don't I deserve a few tears?
乔伊一听到  就哭得死去活来012---When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out.
嘿  我才没有哭得死去活来012---Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!
这就像一个时代的结束012---Come on, it's like the end of an era.
再也没有乔兄和钱哥了012---No more J-Man and Channy's!
我一定要问  有谁那样叫我们012---Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
你又结婚了012---You got married again?
对012---Yes.
这是你两年内第二次结婚012---So that's your second marriage in two years?
对   两年两次012---Yes. Second in two years.
总共三次012---Third, overall.
罗斯  我当了二十三年离婚律师012---Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years...
没有一个客户比你捧场012---...and never have I had so much business from one client.
告诉我怎么回事012---Why don't you tell me what happened?
基本上   瑞秋和我在赌城   我们喝醉了012---Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas, and we got drunk.
抱歉  她就是你上次结婚012---I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel whose name you said...
叫错的那个瑞秋012---...at the altar in the second marriage?
对   对   对012---Yes, yes, yes. Heh.
但是我并不爱她012---But I do not love her.
噢012---Oh.
这就好多了012---That's better then.
这只是酒醉犯错   我要办注销012---This was just a drunken mistake, and I need to get it annulled.
我懂了012---I see.
你考虑过接受治疗吗012---Have you considered therapy?
我想今天办注销就好了012---I think just the annulment for today.
要填几份表格  简单012---There are some forms to fill out. Easy.
必须有证人证明   你们当时神智不清012---We'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind.
没问题012---No problem. Heh.
你和瑞秋得向法官说明012---And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
不能不找她吗012---There's no way to do this without her?
我已经告诉她事情都办妥了012---Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of.
当然  你可以这么说012---Of course you did.
罗斯  你和瑞秋都在场  才能办理注销012---Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
那找一个长得像瑞秋的人呢012---What about someone who looks like Rachel?
我会考虑接受治疗012---I will think about the therapy.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我想我们应该开始分东西了012---So, um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
好吧012---0Kay.
没必要拖拖拉拉的012---No point in dragging it out.
我是说你搬走012---Dragging out the long process of you moving out...
我们分开的事012---...and us not living together anymore.
好的012---0Kay.
瑞秋  怎样012---Hey, Rach. Yeah?
这是什么  这个要归谁啊012---What about this? Who gets this?
我不知道我想不想要  它有太多回忆012---See, I don't know if I want it because it might be too many memories.
那是什么  我不知道012---What is that? I don't know.
瑞秋012---Rachel.
大盘子呢  我要你留着大盘子012---How about this? I want you to have the big plate.
谢谢  莫妮卡  我很喜欢这个盘子012---Wow, Monica, thanks. I love this plate.
这样你就会记得我012---Something to remember me by.
你又不是快死了  我只是要搬出去012---Mon, you're not dying. I'm just moving out.
我们还是会常常见面012---We're gonna see each other all the time.
但这是个大转变012---But still, it's a big change.
甚至是一个时代的结束012---The end of an era, you might say.
你还好吗  眼睛都没眨012---Are you okay? You're not blinking.
我很好  我只是在想一个时代要结束了012---I'm fine. I was thinking about how it's an end of an era.
好吧012---Oh, all right.
但老实说  六年应该称不上一个时代012---But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.
一个时代就是一段重要的日子012---An era is defined as a significant period of time.
我觉得重要  或许你不觉得重要012---It was significant for me. Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
你是怎么了  你刚才怎么了012---What is the matter with you? What is the matter with you?
你为什么没有更不开心012---Why aren't you more upset?
我们要分开了  你不难过吗012---Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?!
你都不会想我吗012---Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
好吧  说出来你别生气012---Monica, all right. But don't get mad at me.
我只是有点难以相信012---It's just a little hard to believe.
难以相信什么012---What's hard to believe?
你们啊  你们就是这样012---I mean, it's you guys. You do this kind of stuff, you know?
你们在赌城说要结婚  又不结了012---You were gonna get married in Vegas, and then you backed out.
我并不认为你们会真的同居  对不起012---I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it. I'm sorry.
瑞秋012---Rachel.
事情已经确定了012---It's going to happen.
钱德会搬进来012---Chandler is gonna move in here.
但是  你先听我说完012---But I-No, wait. Just let me finish, okay?
这不是在赌城的一时冲动012---This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
我们真的想要住在一起012---This is something that we both really want.
我们会住在一起012---And it is going to happen.
是吗012---It is?
真的012---Really?
没错012---Yeah, sweetie.
我们不能再住在一起了012---You mean, we're not gonna live together anymore?
不行了012---No.
嗯012---Well...
天哪  我会好想你012---Oh, my God. I'm gonna miss you so much.
我也是012---I'm gonna miss you.
这是个时代的结束012---I mean, it's the end of an era!
我知道012---I know!
再见  又来了012---Okay, bye. Oh, no.
你去办注销了吗012---So did you get the annulment?
我办不了  我就知道   因为你爱瑞秋012---I couldn't. I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
不是那样的  事情比想像中复杂012---It's not that. Annulments are more complicated--
爱让它变得复杂012---Complicated because of the love.
我不爱瑞秋012--- I… I do, I do not love Rachel..
我现在就去告诉她012---I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing ...
好尽快把手续办好012---...so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
我如果爱她  会这么做吗012---Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
我现在更确信你爱她012---I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
我对瑞秋没有感觉  好吗012---I do not have feelings for Rachel, okay?
怎么了012---Oh, what's wrong?
摩妮卡和钱德真的要同居了012---Monica and Chandler are moving in here...
我得搬出去  一切都要变了012---...and I have to move out and everything is changing.
过来  别难过012---Oh, my, come here, come here. It's okay.
不会有事的012---Aw, everything's gonna be okay.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
不客气012---Of course.
罗斯和瑞秋结婚了012---So Ross and Rachel got married.
摩妮卡和钱德差点结婚012---Monica and Chandler almost got married.
我们要不要也勾搭勾搭012---You think you and I should hook up?
要012---Oh, we do. Ha, ha.
但不是现在012---But not just yet.
是吗  那是什么时候012---Really? Well, when?
好012---Okay. Um.
首先  钱德和摩妮卡会结婚012---Ahem, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married...
还会发大财012---...and be filthy rich, by the way.
但婚姻会破裂  天哪012---But it won't work out. Wow.
是啊012---I know.
然后我会为钱嫁给钱德012---Then I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money.
你会娶瑞秋生几个漂亮小孩012---And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
太好了012---Great.
接着我们就抛弃他们结婚012---But then we ditch those two and we get married.
我们会有钱德的财产  瑞秋的孩子012---We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids.
监护权很好抢  因为瑞秋酗酒012---Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
那罗斯呢012---Ooh, ooh, what about Ross?
我不想多说  不过012---I don't want to go into the whole thing, but, um...
我们吵架  我杀了他012---...we have words and I kill him.
