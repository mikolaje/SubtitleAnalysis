嘿  你看  太不可思议了012---Hey. Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.
乔伊已经憋气将近四分钟了012---Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes.
猪头  你想闷死我啊012---Dude! You trying to kill me?!
菲比  我问你件事  什么事012---Pheebs, I wanna ask you something. Uh-huh, what?
既然我要搬出去  你又这么美丽012---Um, well, since I'm moving out and you're so beautiful...
我搬去跟你住如何012---...how about I move in with you?
太好了  但是狄妮丝怎么办012---Well, that would be great, but then what do we do about Denise?
谁是狄妮丝  我的室友012---Who's Denise? My roommate.
你有室友  对  狄妮丝012---You have a roommate? Yes, Denise. Denise.
你干嘛啊  菲比  这么神秘012---Hey, what is with the secrecy, Phoebe? Huh?
这个狄妮丝  她可爱吗012---And what about this Denise? She cute?
我们怎么会不知道你有室友012---How can you have a roommate that none of us know about?
也许是因为都没人在听我讲话012---Maybe because you never listen to anything I say.
我一天到晚都提起她   狄妮丝012---I talk about her all the time. Denise!
瑞秋  我在想  我那里会多一个房间012---Hey Rach, listen,  I was thinkin’ uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place.
没错  你何不搬来跟我住012---Oh, that's true. Yeah, Why don't you move in with me?
多好啊  我们可以熬夜谈心  看电影012---It'll be great. We can stay up late talking, watch movies.
你知道赤裸星期四的规定吧012---And you know about naked Thursdays, right?
我还是自己找房子好了012---Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna find my own place.
我以为赤裸星期四  是我们的专利012---Hey, hey. I thought naked Thursdays was just our thing, man.
老友记  第六季  第3集  爱与不爱012---Friends  S06E03 The One With Ross’s Denial
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你没办注销  瑞秋怎么说012---So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
那个啊  她还蛮平静的012---Oh, that. Um, she took it really well.
你没说  对吧  没有012---Oh. You didn't tell her, did you? No.
当然没有  因为你爱她  我并不爱她012---Of course not, Because you're in love with her. I am not in love with her.
她在为搬家的事难过012---She was very upset about having to move out.
所以我就没说  免得她更不开心012---So I didn't tell her we were still married, because she'd only get more upset.
我只是以一个朋友的身份安慰她012---I-I just comforted her, As a friend.
什么叫安慰她  也没什么  我抱了抱她012---What do you mean, "comforted her"? It was nothing. I gave her a hug.
拥抱  正是爱的表示012---Aha. A classic sign of love, the hug.
也是友情的表现012---It's also a sign of friendship.
在这里不是  痴情男012---Yeah, not in your case, Lovey Loverson.
那只是个拥抱012---It was a hug.
告诉我   你有没有闻她的头发012---Just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
闻她的头发   如果有呢012---Smell her hair? Well, what if I did?
九成女性的荷尔蒙散发自头部012---Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out the top of her head.
所以女人都比较矮012---That’s why, that's why women are shorter.
好让男人在拥抱时爱上她们012---So that men will fall in love when they hug them.
拜托  罗斯  你还是个科学家呢012---Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.
我是以一个朋友的身份抱她012---I was hugging her as a friend,
又不是把脸埋进她的头发里012---It's not my fault her hair got in my face.
她的头发很多  有一股012---She's got a lot of it, and it smells all, uh...
你知道的  椰子香012---...you know, coconutty.
又怎样么  那不代表我对她有感觉012---What? Oh. It doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel.
或许我是对椰子有感觉012---Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts.
好  随你怎么说  但你要小心  瑞秋的心情和你不同012---Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful. Rachel's not in the same place you are.
如果这个心情是指的爱情012---Okay, if the place you're referring to is being in love...
那她和我的心情一样   因为我不是那个心情012---...then she is in the same place as me, because I am not in that place.
好  我听不懂012---Okay, I didn't understand that.
但或许是因为  你讲得是爱的秘语012---But maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
刚才有你的电话  是谁012---Dude, some guy just called for you. Who was it?
我哪知道012---I don't know.
你怎么不 "谢我帮你留言"012---How about "Thanks for taking the message"? Jeez.
听着012---Hey, listen.
等你搬进来   瑞秋的房间就空出来了012---When you move in, Rachel's room's gonna be empty.
要不要来讨论一下  怎么利用啊012---You wanna talk about what we wanna do with it?
当然  好012---Sure. Okay.
我想我们应该弄个漂亮的客房012---I think we should have a beautiful guest room, right? 
有红木雪橇床  床头桌上永远插着鲜花012---...with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! 
再摆张卷盖式书桌   放上留言卡012---Then we could have a rolltop desk with comment cards...
让客人表达他们的开心012---...so people can tell us how much they love staying here.
之类的  总之我还没有想到太多012---Whatever, you know, I really haven't thought about it that much.
我喜欢这个主意   当然喜欢012---Well, I like that idea, obviously. Ha, ha.
我在想或许可以弄个游戏房  怎么样012---But I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, you know?
我们可以买旧的游戏机012---I mean, you can buy old arcade games...
像《太空入侵者》和《小行星》  只要两百元012---...like "Space invaders" and "Asteroids" for $200.
像真正的街机  那些大的  大的一台012---The real ones. The big, big, big ones.
不要012---No.
你的意思是  "天哪  钱德  太有趣的主意了012---Okay, so you mean "no" as in, "Gee, Chandler, what an interesting idea.
我们先讨论再全盘否定"012---Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
对不起  当然啦012---Oh. I'm sorry. Of course.
确实是很有趣的主意  不过谈过了  还是不要012---Yes. Interesting idea, um, talk about it, but no.
就这样了012---So that's it?
对啊  漂亮的客房不适合放游戏机012---Well, I just don't think that arcade games go in the beautiful guest room.
倒是应该有很多古董才对012---The beautiful guest room's gonna be filled with antiques.
所以《小行星》才适合   那是最古老的游戏机012---Which is why "Asteroids" is perfect. It's the oldest game.
你对漂亮的客房有什么意见012---What do you have against the beautiful guest room
我没有意见012---I don't have anything against the guest room.
尤其是我们认识的人都住在方圆数公尺内012---Especially since everybody that we know lives about 30 seconds away.
你在嘲笑我吗012---Are you mocking me?
我没有在嘲笑你   也没有嘲笑你漂亮的客房012---No, I'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room.
怎么了012---What's up?
没事  摩妮卡和我吵架了012---Nothing. Monica and I had a stupid fight.
但你们还是要同居吧  对吧  我的广告今天出来了012---But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"诚征女性室友  不抽烟  不丑"012---"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly."
漂亮012---Nice. Ah?
我想说在你之后012---I just figured y’know, after living with you...
换个女室友想着还挺有趣的012---...it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate.
一个我可以学习   和我不一样的人012---You know? Someone I could learn from. Someone who's different than me.
谁和我最不一样   年过十九的男人012---And what's more different than me, a guy who's not 19...
还是十九岁的女孩012---...than, say, a girl who is 19?
我可不是草包  朋友012---Not just a hat rack, my friend.
菲比  我想问  嘘  我正在忙012---Pheebs, I have to ask you-Shh. I'm swamped right now.
你只是在发呆012---You're just staring into space.
我想移动那支铅笔012---Um, I'm trying to move that pencil.
这支吗  成功了012---This one? It worked!
菲比  找房子真是恶梦012---Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.
我租得起的地方都有怪胎室友012---Every place that I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak.
你看嘛012---Look at this.
"诚征女性室友  不抽烟  不丑"012---"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly."
没房子了  纽约都住满了  等等   这里有012---it's just there's nothing. This city is full. Wait, no, look at this.
"两房两卫  不抽烟012---"Two-bedroom, two-bath. Must be nonsmoker.
拜撒旦者可"012---Satan worshipers okay."
不过是一楼012---Oh. Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
瑞秋  你还在找房子  对  怎样012---Rach, are you still looking for a place? Yeah, why?
好  我们博物馆有个华伦012---Okay, there's this guy Warren from the museum...
要去参与挖掘工作两年时间012---...and he's going on a dig for like two years.
他有个漂亮的家要转租012---And he's got this great place he needs to sublet.
你有兴趣吗012---So you interested?
听起来好棒  我愿意住华伦家   我爱华伦012---That sounds great. I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren.
谢谢你  别谢我012---Thank you. Oh, don't thank me.
要谢就谢那座火山吧012---You wanna thank someone, thank the volcano...
几千年前爆发012---...that erupted thousands of years ago...
毁灭却也保存了整个文明012---...killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.
这是华伦的电话012---Here's Warren's number.
太好了  我现在就打给他012---Oh, this is great. I am gonna call him right now.
噢  好  谢谢你012---Oh, okay. Oh. Thank you. Ha, ha.
好  快去吧012---Okay, you go call him.
我看到了012---I saw it.
我不知道你在说什么012---I don't know what you're talking about.
我在说你知道却不肯承认的事012---I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit.
你又爱上她了  你重复爱她012---You know, that you love her again. You relove her.
真的  我没有重复爱她012---Look, I do not relove her.
你居然这么嘴硬012---I can't believe you won't just admit it.
总之  你千万别做蠢事012---Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
我们现在只是朋友  我为什么要做蠢事012---Look, we're just friends now, okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
房子已经租出去了012---Ugh. Well, the apartment is already subletted.
没希望了  我找不到房子了012---I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
你可以来跟我住012---You can live with me.
什么  什么012---What? What?
怎么样012---What?
天哪  你是说真的吗012---Oh, my God, are you serious? Uh-huh.
我求之不得  太好了  谢谢你012---I would love to live with you, Ross. That's great. Thank you.
很高兴  能帮到你就好012---I'm just glad I could, you know, help you out.
我都替你们高兴  这真是太聪明了012---Wow, I'm so happy for you guys. This is so, so not stupid.
罗斯  这对我太重要了012---Ross, Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.
我差点就要流落街头  你救了我  你是我的英雄012---I mean, I was gonna be homeless. You've just saved me. You're my hero.
说英雄就太那个  好吧012---Hero? I don't know. Well, all right.
我要去告诉摩妮卡  她的哥哥有多棒012---Oh. I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.
别这样  拜托012---Aw. Mwah. Oh, please.
你又有话要说了吧012---You're gonna say things now, aren't you?
没有012---No. No, I won't.
但是我告诉你012---But I should tell you this.
我的室友狄妮丝就是这样的012---This exact same thing happened to my roommate, Denise.
她搬去跟一个偷娶她的人住012---She moved in with a guy...
他嘴上说不爱  其实很爱她012---...who was secretly married to her and said he didn't love her but really did.
后来事情爆发012---and it just blew up!
所以她才搬来跟我住012---And that's how she ended up living with me.
好吧  我骗你的012---Okay, that's a lie.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
刚才很抱歉   我不需要游戏房012---Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room.
我以前找不到女孩才去打游戏的012---When I was a kid, I only played those games because I couldn't get girls.
现在我得到了012---Now I can get--
现在我有了你012---Now I have you.
不  我并不是把你当成012---No, not that I think that I have you...
或者想成一件财产012---...or think of you as property in any sort of way.
我对女人  别再说了  钱德012---I see women-Stop it, Chandler.
我也很抱歉012---I'm sorry too.
真的  对012---Really? Yeah. Oh, yes.
当然012---Oh.
我们不必去弄一个客房012---Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room.
我们可以一起想想  要怎么利用  好主意012---we can think of something to do with the room together. That's a great idea.
要做到皆大欢喜很容易012---We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
就是啊012---Totally.
我们不必现在就想  好吧012---We don't have to come up with this now. Oh, good.
不如来想想  客厅要怎么变化012---Hey, y’know what? Why don't we think about changes that we can make in the living room?
变化012---Changes?
对  我们得移动一些家俱  来放我的椅子012---Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have to move some furniture to make room for my chair.
你要把懒人椅搬过来012---You're gonna bring the Barcalounger over here?
有问题吗  嗯012---Is that a problem? Well...
那是一组的  应该摆在一起012---It's just that they're a set and they should probably stay together.
那好  那我就统统搬过来012---Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
你是要它们离开老家012---See, now you're taking them away from their home.
好  我懂了  这里没我的东西  只有你的东西012---Okay, I get it. So I get nothing. Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours.
我早上起床  就穿上你的衣服   然后去上班012---I'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes, and head off to work.
没错  这里  这是我说的012---Yeah. Yeah, you know what? That's it. That's it.
只有我的东西  没有你的012---Everything will be mine. Nothing will be yours.
拜托  我是在讲懒人椅012---Oh, come on. Chandler! I'm talking about the Barcalounger.
它跟这里不搭  你要摆哪里012---It just, It doesn't match. Where is it gonna go?
游戏房里012---In the game room.
你的椅子丑到爆  又不是我的错012---Look, it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly.
好  我不搬椅子过来  我什么都不搬过来012---That's fine. That’s fine! I won't bring over the chairs. I won't bring anything over.
我可不想破坏老奶奶家的调调012---I wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!
你的条件看起来很好啊012---Everything on your application looks really good.
最后一个问题012---Oh, just one last question.
你和你朋友  会不会常来这里狂欢聚会012---Are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
放心  我不太爱玩012---Oh, don't worry. I'm not really a party girl.
嗯012---Whoa.
别想都不想就说012---Now, don't just be blurting stuff out.
我要你想清楚再答012---I want you to really think about your answers.
你不必找室友了  你好  我要住在这里012---You can call off the roommate search. Hi. I'll be living here.
别理他012---Oh, don't listen to him.
他很想住进来012---He's just some guy who wants the apartment.
但我不会选他012---But I don't think he's gonna get it.
你干嘛把浴帘拿掉012---Why did you take the shower curtain down?
那个东西很危险012---That thing was a hazard.
我很注重安全012---I'm very safety-conscious.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我正在清理些空间给你012---Oh, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks.
但我刚去找了摩妮卡012---But listen, I was just at Monica's...
她和钱德大吵了一架  不同居了012---...and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
什么叫不同居了  他们还是要同居吧012---What do you mean, not moving in? They're still moving in, right?
不  他们为了怎么利用空房间   大吵了一架012---No, no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
就为了一个烂房间012---What? Over a stupid room?
我也有点替他们可惜012---y’know，I feel kind of bad for them...
但是又很高兴  可以不必搬过来了012---...but I'm also really psyched because I don't have to move in here.
没错  这一点的确很棒012---Oh, no. Yeah. No, that part's great.
你们两个是在吵什么012---What's all this about you guys fighting?
真的就为了一个房间嘛012---Is this really over a room?
那真是太傻了012---I mean, that is so silly.
罗斯  我们自己可以摆平  显然不行012---Ross, we can handle this. Well, apparently not.
我不能坐视两个我关心的人012---And I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about so much...
为了这么傻的事伤感情012---...be hurt by something that is so silly.
别再傻了  你叫她别傻啊012---I mean, enough of the silliness. Why don't you tell her to stop being silly?
好  好012---Okay, okay.
双方都有理012---Two very good points.
我认识你们两个很久了012---Look, I've known you both a long time.
你们在一起之后012---And I've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy...
比以前快乐一百万倍012---...as you've been since you got together.
你们真的要为了一个房间   放弃这一切012---Do you really wanna throw that all away over a room?
太傻了啊012---That is so silly.
什么比较重要  爱情012---What's more important, love...
还是傻气012---...or silliness?
我们喜欢傻气012---Well, we are fond of the silliness.
但面对爱情也会心软012---But we also have a soft spot for the love.
爱是万灵药  欢笑才是吧012---Love is the best medicine. That's laughter.
你为什么这样  我不知道012---Why do you do it? I don't know.
好了  钱德  你想跟摩妮卡住吧012---Now, Chandler, you wanna live with Monica, right?
对  我想啊012---Yeah, I do.
摩妮卡  你想跟钱德住吧012---And, Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't you?
对012---Yes.
很好  口头契约  在纽约州有约束力012---Good. A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York.
我听说你在找房子012---So I understand you're looking for a place?
不  我不搬了012---No, no, I'm staying put. Oh.
我本来打算找你来我家住012---I was going to offer you my apartment.
那为什么  你要去哪里012---Why? Where are you going?
我不知道012---I don't know.
嘿  瑞秋  嗨012---Hey, Rach. Hi.
说了你一定不信  钱德和摩妮卡又要同居了012---Uh, you're never gonna believe it. Monica and Chandler are moving in again.
真是太好了  对他们来说  对吧012---That's great news, right? I mean, for them, right?
对啊012---Oh, wow.
不过好处是  我们又能当室友了012---But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
是啊  关于这件事012---Yeah. You know, about that, um...
我很感谢你主动提议012---Ross, ahem, I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything...
但是你不觉得会很怪吗012---...but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
为什么  为…为什么会怪啊012---Why? Why? Why would it--? Why would it be weird?
因为我们012---Well, you know, because of us.
我们的过去012---Because of our history.
不会  不会吗012---No. No?
不  不会012---No, no.
除非我们还余情未了012---It would only be weird if we were still in that place.
你还余情未了吗012---I mean, are you still in that place?
一点也没有  很好  我也没有012---No, not at all. Good. Me neither.
那就没问题了012---So it's not a problem.
我们只是刚好是室友的朋友012---We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
好  但我们迟早会约会012---Okay, but, Ross, eventually, you and I are gonna be dating.
是吗  我们吗012---Really? We are?
是啊  我会有男朋友  你会有女朋友012---Well, yeah. I'm gonna have a boyfriend and you're gonna have a girlfriend.
哇哦012---Oh. Heh.
那太好了012---That'd be great.
不过如果你觉得无所谓  我们就想一套做法012---But if you think it's gonna be okay, we'll just work out a system.
就像大学时代   我在门上挂个牌子012---It'll be like in college. I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign:
"暂且回避  正在炒饭"012---"Come back later. I'm getting lucky."
我想都没想过012---Yeah, I didn't think of that.
你们确定要住在一起012---So are you sure about this whole moving-in thing?
这是很大的进展   急什么呢012---I mean, it's a really big step. And what's the rush?
真好笑012---That's very funny.
他在装傻  因为他知道我们喜欢傻气012---He's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness.
不  我是说真的  你们想想012---No, I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it.
你搬进来  你们为了游戏房的事吵架012---You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms...
接下来就会分手012---...next thing you know, you break up.
罗斯  你说得对  吵那种架真的很蠢啊012---Ross, you were right before. It was just a stupid fight about a room.
一点也不蠢012---Okay, there are no stupid fights.
重点不是房间012---This isn't about the room.
而是房间代表什么012---This is about what the room represents.
很不幸的  这个房间会毁了你们012---And unfortunately, this room could destroy you.
我没那么担心  我也是012---Yeah, I'm not so worried. Yeah, no, me neither.
好吧  这是你们的人生012---Fine. It's your life.
我只是不想看到你们分手012---I just don't wanna see you break up. y’know 
你们要是同居就会分手012---Which you will do if you move in together.
但你们想这样  我也没办法012---But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do.
不要同居012---Don't do it!
你还是想搬进来吧  当然012---You still wanna move in together, right? Of course.
罗斯没吓到你吧012---Ross didn't scare you?
吓得我死也不敢跟他住012---Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
过来  我给你看样东西  好012---Come here, I gotta show you something. Okay.
天哪  正方形人被杀了012---Oh, my God, someone's killed Square Man.
我觉得懒人椅可以放这里012---This is where the Barcalounger could go.
你可以看电视  离厨房又够近012---You see, you can see the TV, and still, it's walking distance to the kitchen.
真周到012---Oh, that's so sweet.
我也有事要说  好012---I wanna show you something too! Okay!
你知道道路会合的标志吧012---You know those big-big uh, road signs that say "merge"?
我想我们可以弄一个012---You know? So I was thinking we could get one of those signs...
挂在床头上012---...and hang it over our bed.
因为你和我就是那样012---Because that's you and I together.
合而为一012---"Merge."
天哪  我好喜欢啊  真的012---Oh, my God, I love that. Really?
才怪012---"No."
谢谢012---Thank you.
如果想收到我的演出电邮讯息012---If you wanna receive e-mails about my upcoming shows...
请捐钱给我   让我买电脑012---...then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
嗯012---So, uh... Ahem.
其他人呢012---Where are the other guys?
摩妮卡和钱德在忙012---Well, let's see, Monica and Chandler are occupied.
吵架  不  是忙别的012---Fighting? No, the other thing.
真高兴他们能和好012---I really think it's great they worked things out.
谁也别想拆散他们  对吧012---Yeah, there's no breaking them up, is there?
可以跟你借钥匙去配一副吗   当然可以012---Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can make a copy? Sure!
拿去  谢谢012---Here. Thank you.
你确定吗012---Now, are you sure?
配了钥匙  就不能反悔了012---Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
我确定012---Yeah, I'm sure.
趁我改变心意前快去吧012---Now get out of here before I change my mind.
听着  罗斯012---Uh, listen, Ross.
跟瑞秋住真的好吗012---do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
我也在摇摆不定012---I've been back and forth.
也许你应该摆回去012---Yeah, well, maybe you should go back, okay?
瑞秋搬进去012---Rachel moves in, and before you know it...
不知不觉间  你们就又复合了012---...you're where you don't wanna be, back together.
应该不会012---Yeah, I don't think so.
她已经在谈交男朋友的事了012---She's already talking about, you know, dating other guys.
不会有结果的012---That's not gonna work out.
她会哭着回家  你会告诉她012---Then she's gonna come home all weepy, and you'll be telling her:
"没关系   你会找到好男人"012---"Oh, that's okay. You'll find someone."
接着砰  她找到了你012---And then, barn, she finds you.
也许你说得对012---Huh. Oh, maybe you're right.
她绝对会再爱上你  这样你也愿意吗012---I am telling you, Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.
是你想要的嘛012---Now, is that what you want?
是我想要的嘛  是的012---Heh. Is that what I want? Yes.
她来了  我来替你省点事012---Here she comes. I'm gonna make your life much easier.
五金行打烊了  改天再打012---All right, well, the place was closed, I’ll just copy it later.
或是别打了012---Or not.
瑞秋  你就搬来跟我住嘛012---Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
乔伊  等等  没关系012---Whoa, whoa, Joey. No, no, no. It's okay.
瑞秋  我知道赤裸星期四把你吓跑了012---I mean Look, Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole naked-Thursdays thing...
但是我们也可以不做012---...but we don't have to do that.
搬到对面确实比较轻松012---Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall.
慢着  除非你想改成赤裸星期三012---Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays.
你不喜欢星期四  那就挑一天012---Thursday's clearly not good for you. Pick a day.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
请进  谢谢你再跑一趟012---Come on in. Thanks for coming back.
有很多人想租012---Okay, there have been a lot of people interested in the room.
但我经过筛选  你是最后人选之一012---But I have narrowed it down, and you are one of the finalists.
太好了  在做决定之前012---Great. Okay, now, before I make my decision...
我想确定一下  我们合不合得来012---...I just wanna make sure that our personalities match, okay?
所以我发明了一个小测验012---So I made up a little test.
我说一个词  你就说出第一个联想012---Now, I'm gonna say a word, and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
没问题  好  那我们开始012---I can do that. Okay, here we go.
