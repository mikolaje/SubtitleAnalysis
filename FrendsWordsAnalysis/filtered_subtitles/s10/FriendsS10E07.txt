嗨  你俩在干什么012---Hey, you guys. Hey, what are you doing?
筹备婚礼012---Figuring out our wedding plans.
太巧了  我们也正合计这事呢012---Funny. We were doing the same thing.
疯了  场地  服装  食品012---It's really crazy. The hall, the dress, the food.
没想到结个婚这么贵012---I had no idea how expensive this was.
是很贵012---Yeah, it is really pricey.
第一次算出结婚费用  我被那个数字吓呆了012---I freaked when I heard the numbers.
结果你们怎么做的012---So, what did you two do about it?
简单012---It was simple.
我想出了一些省钱方案012---I came up with some cost-cutting solutions...
列了个清单  结果莫妮卡叫我去死012---...wrote out a list, and Monica told me to go to hell.
没钱好省的012---There's no way around it.
只能接受现实  确实会花很多钱012---Just accept that this is gonna cost a lot of money.
听说每年花在结婚上的钱高达400亿012---I heard that weddings are, like, a $40 billion-a-year industry.
这其中我贡献过半012---Yeah. And I'm responsible for just, like, half of that.
我觉得这钱应该用在更有意义的事上012---But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use.
当真012---Are you serious?
把婚礼经费012---Yeah. How would you feel
捐献给慈善事业012---if we gave all the wedding money to charity...
我们就到市政厅登个记  如何012---...and we just got married at City Hall?
这让我越发想娶你了012---I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
不得不说  你们的高姿态  很好012---I gotta say, you guys, that's an incredible gesture.
下次你结婚也这么干如何012---Maybe you do that next time you get married.
不不不  下次我要在夏威夷斜阳下结婚012---No, no, no. The next time's gonna be Hawaii at sunset.
不过下下次可以听取你的意见012---But maybe the time after that.
《老友记》  第十季  第7集  领养中心来家访012---Friends S10E07 The One With The Home Study
-嘿  忙啥呢  -嘿012---- Hey. What's going on? - Hey.
领养中心有人来家访012---Our adoption social worker is coming,
所以我们在扫除012---so we're cleaning the apartment.
我们012---"We"?
你不想我掺和012---You know you don't want me to help.
别现在又说这个012---You can't have it both ways.
这个人能决定012---Is this the person who decides
你们是否收养一个孩子012---whether or not you get a baby?
差不多  这人来视察我们的生活环境012---Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
我们必须表现得完美012---And it has to go perfectly,
若她对我们有丝毫不满012---because if she doesn't like something about us
她就会让我们进不了012---she can keep us off
全国任何一个领养的名单里012---every adoption list in the state.
我可以过来友情协力一把012---Hey, maybe I should stop by.
她没准爱看肥皂剧012---She could be a soap opera fan.
小人物认识演艺名流012---It's very impressive
可以蓬壁生辉呢012---when the little people know a celebrity.
小人物012---"Little people"?
名流012---"Celebrity."
我觉得我做的差不多了012---So I think I'm just about done here.
除非你还在哪012---Unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere,
藏了像黄书  香烟什么的012---like porn or cigarettes?
什么012---What?
-才没有  -钱德勒012---- No. - Chandler.
我没有012---I don't,
这样玷污人家清白太气人了012---and I'm offended by the insinuation.
沙发下没有杂志012---So there's not a magazine under the couch...
厕所水箱后没有一包香烟012---...or cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank...
录象机里没有A片012---...or a filthy video in the VCR?
香烟和杂志我认帐012---I'll admit to the cigarettes and magazine.
但带子不是我的012---But that tape is not mine.
也不是我的012---It isn't mine.
我想我们永远不会知道是谁的了012---I guess we'll never know whose it is.
可以帮忙吗012---May I help you?
我们来给孩子们012---Yes. We're here
捐一大笔钱012---to make a rather sizable donation to the children.
捐钱不论多少  心意都是一样重012---Any contribution, large or small,
我们都会感激012---is appreciated.
数目这样大012---I think you're gonna appreciate
你一定会把屎都感动出来了012---the crap out of this one.
你们真大方012---Well, this is very generous.
我们要匿名捐助012---And we don't want any recognition.
完全匿名012---This is completely anonymous.
完全匿名  就写两个陌生人012---Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
先生甲和菲比·布菲012---Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
如果你们愿意012---Well if you like,
我们可以把二位的名字登到新闻通讯里012---we can include your names in our newsletter.
没必要012---Not necessary.
布菲的拼法是  B-U-F-F-A-Y012---Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
先生甲的写法是  迈克·汉尼根012---And X is spelled "Mike Hannigan."
我代表孩子们多谢两位012---Well, on behalf of the children, thank you both very much.
我很高兴我们这么做了  感觉真棒012---I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.
是啊  非常棒012---It does. It feels really good.
还有免费T恤拿012---Oh, look. And we get these free T-shirts.
那是我健身穿的012---Actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
难怪是湿的012---It's moist.
艾玛会很快起床的012---Hi. Emma will be up in a minute.
好啊012---Oh, good.
嘿  罗斯  听说你跟查莉的事了012---Hey, Ross, listen. I heard about you and Charlie.
替你难过012---I'm really sorry.
没事012---That's okay.
美貌的考古学家多的是012---I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
当然012---Absolutely.
只有一个  就是她012---There was one. She's it.
其他的就好象是桥洞居民一样012---All the rest look like they should live under a bridge.
今天想怎么玩012---So, what are you gonna do today?
带艾玛去街心游乐场怎么样012---I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground.
天啊  什么012---Oh, my God. What?
我又没说012---Like I said, I was thinking of
带她去武器弹药博物馆012---taking Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.
听着  罗斯012---Okay, look, Ross.
我反对艾玛去游乐场012---I do not want Emma going to the playground.
因为012---Because...?
好吧  如果你想知道…012---All right, if you must know, I had a traumatic...
我小时候荡秋千遇险012---...swing incident when I was little.
-真的  -我才四岁012---- Seriously? - Yes. I was 4 years old.
我荡秋千012---And I was on the swing...
突然头发缠到铁链上012---...and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain.
结果老妈剪掉我一大缕头发012---And to get me out,
才救我出来012---my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair.
结果有好几星期头发才长齐012---And it was uneven for weeks.
你竟熬了过来012---And you made it through that?
简直可以拍成电影012---I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie.
你尽管拿我取笑012---Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
反正我就是不想艾玛去012---I do not want Emma going there.
我在想能不能让克莱尔·丹妮丝扮演我012---And I was thinking Claire Danes.
你的悲剧令我同情012---Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy.
不过秋千很安全012---But the swings are perfectly safe.
而且艾玛喜欢荡秋千012---And besides, Emma loves them.
我们同去  你就知道了012---You should come, and you'll see.
秋千速度高达40英里/小时012---Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.
当你荡到最高处012---And there's that moment when you're at the top...
鬼才知道会不会返回地球012---...when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to Earth.
宇宙充满小孩子绕轨道运行012---Space is filled with orbiting children.
求你了  来嘛012---Look, please, just come on.
你若看见艾玛的小表情012---When you see the look on Emma's face,
决不会后悔012---I swear, you won't regret it.
-好吧  -太好了012---- All right. - Good.
你不会像有的妈妈那样012---You don't wanna be a mom
把自己失去理智的恐惧遗传给小孩吧012---who passes her irrational fears to her children.
"失去理智"012---"Irrational," huh?
下次你被家里的蜘蛛吓到012---I'll remember that next time
我们再谈这个话题012---you freak out about a spider in your apartment.
这两个可以相提并论吗  秋千上012---That's the same. I'm sure there are 30
有30种不同毒液012---different species of poisonous swings.
天啊  领养中心的来早了012---Oh, my God. The adoption lady is early.
好的好的  镇静镇静012---Okay. Okay. Here we go. Here we go.
站直咯012---Stand up straight.
微笑012---Big smile.
你们好  请问这是"毛骨悚然"家吗012---Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?
还以为是领养中心的来了012---We're waiting for the adoption lady.
你来得正好012---But I'm glad you're here.
今早打扫时发现的012---I was cleaning this morning
不知道你用不用得上012---and I found this.
我不知道你是不是想用  但是...012---I don't know if you wanna use it, but....
你真好012---Oh, this is so sweet of you.
但是你知道吗012---But you know what?
我并不需要这头纱012---I won't be needing a veil,
我实际上都不会穿婚纱012---I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
我告诉过你012---I told you,
裸体婚礼我不会参加的012---I am not coming to a naked wedding!
我们不会招待宴请012---No. We're not having a big reception.
我们把婚礼经费012---we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding
捐给儿童慈善事业了012---and we donate them to the children charity.
你真疯狂012---That's crazy!
抱歉  只是无法想象012---I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
一生只有一次啊012---my one wedding day like that.
我们不同012---Well, we're different.
我不在乎什么盛大婚礼012---I don't care about having a huge party.
头纱你戴是很美  但是...012---This is really nice for you, but....
你看我一戴上  简直就...012---Oh, please. I put this on and I just look like--
美极了012---Well, radiant.
管它呢012---All right, but who cares?
我不需要头纱婚纱这些玩意012---I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
对  你们是互许终身012---That's right. You're making a commitment.
不管在广场举行还是别的什么地方都是一样012---You know, that's the same whether you do it at the Plaza or....
-你选了啥地方  -市政厅012---- Where you gonna do it? - City Hall.
好地方012---Oh, that sounds nice.
我刚去过那做评审委员012---I was just there for jury duty.
他们把那打理得非常整洁漂亮呢012---They've really spruced that place up.
没关系...012---Okay. It's okay...
我已经下定决心012---I've made my decision.
但我真正想要的是一个盛大的婚礼012---What I really want is a great big wedding.
但钱已经捐啦012---But you gave all the money to charity.
可以要回来012---Well, I'll just ask for it back.
不行吧012---I don't think you can do that.
怎么不行012---Why not?
她这可是结婚012---This is her wedding day.
这可比什么愚蠢的小孩子重要多了012---That's way more important than some stupid kids.
说得好  亲爱的012---That's sweet, honey,
但这些话省下来说给领养中心的人听吧012---but save something for the adoption lady.
-好  小心点  -好012---- All right, okay. Be careful. - Okay.
小心  小心她头发012---Careful. Watch her hair. Watch her hair!
她才三根毛012---Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
我知道  我知道012---I know. I know.
但是很漂亮012---But they're just so beautiful.
糟糕  扯掉一根012---Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
我保证  她很安全012---I promise you she's safe.
你看她多喜欢玩秋千012---Watch how much she loves this.
好吧  好吧012---Okay. Okay.
你准备好了吗  亲爱的  开始喽012---Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.
小心012---Okay, careful. Okay.
她笑了012---She's smiling.
看  她真的很喜欢012---Look at that, she does like it.
看到没  我告诉过你的吧012---See, I told you.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
看看她真有不怕死的精神012---Look at her, she's a little daredevil.
让我推好不好012---Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?
哦  当然012---Oh, absolutely.
你去拿相机012---Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
在尿布包里012---It's in the diaper bag.
好012---Okay.
还怕秋千012---See? Scared of the swings.
现在觉得傻了吧012---I bet you feel pretty silly.
我们真要把钱要回来012---We're asking for the money back?
结婚要用012---It's for our wedding day.
这小子喜欢男的女的012---Now, is this guy gay or straight?
我们非得出美人计012---Because one of us has to start flirting.
你们一天来捐两次钱012---You here to make another donation the same day?
真是前所未有呢012---I don't think that's ever happened before.
同性恋  你上012---Gay. Go.
天呐  你的衬衣好帅012---Oh, my God, I love your shirt.
我们今天捐的钱012---The donation we made earlier?
我们想要回来012---Well, we want it back.
什么012---Excuse me?
那是办婚礼的钱012---Okay, that money was for a big wedding
我们本来不想大办012---we thought we didn't want.
但现在我们改变了主意012---But it turns out we do.
所以你要我们退还012---So you're asking us
你们捐给孩子们的钱012---to refund your donation to the children?
对012---Yeah.
这样感觉真不错012---This feels really good.
对不起  真的012---I'm sorry. I am.
但婚礼对我相当重要012---But this wedding's just really important to me.
不关我事012---Hey, it's none of my business.
也许这是件好事012---Besides, this is probably a good thing.
别把孩子惯坏了012---We've really been spoiling the children,
让他们吃饱穿暖干嘛012---what with all the food and warm clothing.
你这么说不公平012---That's not fair.
结婚是大事012---A person's wedding is important.
尤其对于我来说012---And especially to me.
我没参加过毕业典礼012---I didn't have a graduation party.
没有毕业舞会012---And I didn't go to prom.
在我的16岁生日的时候012---And I spent my sweet 16 being chased around a tire yard...
我被精神病人在一个废旧轮胎场地狂追012---...by an escaped mental patient
他还说012---who, in his own words, wanted to:
杀我什么的012---"Kill me, or whatever."
我应当有个隆重的婚礼012---So I deserve a real celebration.
我不会让你个流汗男012---And I'm not gonna let some sweaty little man
弄的我觉得内疚012---make me feel badly about it.
她也有可能是在说我012---She could've been talking about either one of us.
我是劳拉012---Hi, I'm Laura.
我来做领养家访012---I'm here for your adoption interview.
我是莫妮卡  这是钱德勒012---Hi, I'm Monica. And this is Chandler.
-请进  -谢谢012---- Please come in. - Thank you.
请进  喝点什么012---Would you like something to drink?
喝水可以了012---Water would be fine.
你总算来了012---We're so glad that you're here.
我们好兴奋  终于开始领养小孩的流程了012---We're excited about getting this process started.
因为我们爱小孩  爱得要死012---Because we love kids. Love them to death.
不是真的要孩子"死"012---Well, not actually to death.
只是这么形容一下012---That's just a figure of speech.
我们爱孩子  恰当合理012---We love kids the appropriate amount...
符合法律法规012---...as allowed by law.
-你们家好可爱  -谢谢012---- Your place is just lovely. - Thank you.
这栋楼的确看起来很卫生012---Yes, this building does have a wholesome,
给人家的感觉012---family feel to it.
我好像来过这里012---I feel like I've been here before.
这里还有谁家在申请领养吗012---Any other couples in the building adopting?
是不是一楼那家012---Is that that couple on the first floor?
我们应该比他们先得到孩子012---Because we should get a baby before them.
他还想卖毒品给我012---That guy tried to sell me drugs.
但其他人都好012---But other than that,
这是栋干净卫生的楼012---wholesome, wholesome building.
怎么012---What?
我想起来了为什么我对这楼有记忆了012---I realized why I remember this place.
真的  怎么回事012---Really? What is it?
哦  没什么012---Oh, it's nothing.
我和住在这栋楼里的一个男人约会012---I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building.
结果无疾而终012---It didn't end very well.
那人该不是叫乔伊·崔比安尼吧012---That wouldn't, by any chance, be Joey Tribbiani?
-就是他  -当然是他012---- Yes! - Of course it was.
良宵过后012---We had a great night.
他说他再打电话给我012---In the morning, he promised he'd call
结果再没联络012---and he didn't.
真他妈混蛋012---Rat bastard!
你们该不是他朋友012---So you're not friends with him?
当然不是  不012---Oh, God, no.
当然不是  不012---No, no, no.
当然不是012---No. Nope.
不...012---No...
不...012---No...
不...012---No...
不...012---No...
不...012---No...
抱歉提到这事012---Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.
那么你们当中有人打算待在家里吗012---So are either one of you planning on staying at home?
有人吗  名人驾到012---Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity?
怎么了012---What was that?
过道上乱跑的疯子012---That's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here.
不过他对小孩很慈祥012---He's great with kids, though.
罗斯  天啊  你还好012---Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
他妹的012---Son of a bitch!
别紧张  我又没说F打头那个字012---Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.
罗斯  看吧012---Ross, see,
早告诉你了  秋千太邪恶了012---I told you! Those swings are evil!
就这一次了012---That is it.
这辈子再也不许012---That's the last time Emma is getting on
艾玛接近它012---one of those things for her entire life.
别这样  不是秋千的错012---No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't the swing's fault.
是我错012---It was my fault.
还有那孩子的错012---And kind of that kid's fault.
他还笑呢  算你恨012---Who is still laughing. Nice.
在再有人受伤之前012---Come on. Can we just get out of here
我们走吧012---before somebody else gets hurt?
不  等等  这样吧012---No. Wait. Ok, ok. I have an idea.
你去荡秋千012---I want you to get on the swing...
你会发现没什么好担心的012---...and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
我知道你意欲何为了012---I know what this is all about.
你一贯嫉妒我满头秀发012---You've always been jealous of my hair.
这只是想你已经成年了012---I just think you're an adult, okay?
该克服那些愚蠢的恐惧了012---And you should get over your silly fears.
好  上就上012---All right, fine. I'll do it.
好012---Good.
如果你敢抓蜘蛛012---If you hold a spider.
在哪儿  在哪儿012---Where?! Where?!
我说"如果"你敢抓蜘蛛012---If you hold a spider.
我听见了012---I know.
伙计们  没事吧012---Guys, is everything okay?
是我  乔伊012---It's me, Joey.
领养012---Adoption!
到底怎么回事012---What's going on?
就是那个叫波特疯子012---Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...
在过道上跑012---...Bert, roaming the halls.
伙计们012---Guys?
接着跑吧  波特012---Keep on roaming, Bert!
今天我们不看你疯了012---We don't want any crazy today!
到底怎么了012---What's going on?
我们等会再说  波特  一切都好012---We'll talk later! Bert. Everything's fine!
听起来就是有问题012---Everything doesn't sound fine.
他独自一个在外面  不会出事吧012---Is he all right out there by himself?
没事  他有监管人012---Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
是他哥012---His older brother...
叫欧尼012---...Ernie.
波特和欧尼012---Bert and Ernie?
无巧不成书012---You can't make this stuff up.
你没说过你16岁生日时012---You never told me about that guy
被男人追杀的故事012---and your sweet 16.
真可怜012---I'm sorry about that.
结局还算好012---Oh, it ended okay.
我朋友毙了他012---One of my friends shot him.
至少你会有个体面婚礼012---At least you'll get a proper wedding.
你该得的012---You really deserve that.
是的  没错012---Yeah, I really do.
知道吗  长这么大我还没风光过012---You know, I had nothing growing up.
就像被我剥夺金钱的那些孩子一样012---Just like the kids I took the money from.
不...  看出你苗头了012---No... I see where this is going.
别又想让我退回去012---Don't make me go back there.
