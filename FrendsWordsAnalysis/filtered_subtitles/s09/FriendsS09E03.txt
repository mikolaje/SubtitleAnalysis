我似乎是没有选择  不是吗012---Well,I kind of have to,don't I?
都是因为这该死的婚戒012---Because of this stupid thing.

我跟上司达成一个协议012---My boss and I worked out a deal
我一星期在塔尔萨待4天就可以了012---where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.
另外3天我可以跟你在一起012---So the other three,I can be here with you.
所以你一星期有4天会不在012---So you're gonna be gone four days a week?
不行012---No.
不好意思  你是习惯性说"不行"吗012---I'm sorry,are you just used to saying that?

我不希望012---I can not live
一年有208天跟你住在不同州012---in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
算的真快012---That's fast math.
我们塔尔萨分公司需要你012---We could use you in Tulsa.
谢谢你试着想出一个不必离别的方法012---Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
但是如果你要去塔尔萨  我会跟你去012---but if you go to Tulsa,I go with you.
你刚刚竟然没有掩住口鼻做呕吐状012---You said that without gagging.
真的耶012---I know!
你说什么012---Well,excuse me?
是吗  你也去吃屎吧012---Oh,yeah? Well,up yours too!

瑞秋  你不能在凌晨三点打电话给人家的012---Rach,you can't call people at 3:00 in the morning.
靠  你说话口气跟他老婆一样012---You know what? You sound just like his wife.
艾玛有什么不舒服吗012---Was there anything even wrong with Emma?
当然  不然咧  我又不是疯了012---Yes,of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane.
是什么问题012---What was it?

瑞秋  我告诉过你了012---Rachel, I told you,
不能每次有鸡毛蒜皮的小事都打给他012---you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.

格曼医生吗012---Dr. Gettleman?
不  我认为这不是个好主意012---Yeah,no,I don't think that's a good idea.

为什么坏事都发生在我身上012---Why does everything happen to me?
瑞秋  我保证  明天第一件事012---Rach, I promise,first thing tomorrow,

什么  哪里  你不舒服吗012---What? Where? You're not feeling well?
你患了什么病  风疹吗012---What do you have? Rubella?
别靠近艾玛  她还没有注射疫苗012---Because don't go near Emma,she has not had that shot.
仔细想想  倒确实有点像是风疹012---You know,come to think of it,it does feel rubellalike.
维纳012---Wiener!
维纳  维纳  维纳012---Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

我不能告诉你我是怎么知道的012---I can't tell you how I know this,
但是她并不反对3P012---but she is not opposed to threesomes.
好吧012---All right.
说说我的约会对象吧 不行012--- So tell me something about my guy.  No.
别这样  透露一点嘛 他叫什么名字012---Come on,give me something. What's his name?
麦克012---Mike.
麦克  好的  他姓什么呢012---Mike. Okay,what's his last name?
该死  就不能为浪漫保留点神秘感吗012---Damn it! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore?!
那好吧012---All right.
几小时后与你和麦克在餐厅见012---We'll see you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
好的  没问题  待会见  拜拜012---All right,great. See you. Byebye.
我为什么要说麦克呢012---Why'd I have to say Mike?
我根本不认识叫麦克的012---I don't know a Mike!
我怎么就没说个别的什么名字012---Why couldn't I have said..?
里面根本就没有男生的号码012---There's no guys in there!
要找个好医生真是难012---It's impossible to find a good doctor.
要如何分辨哪个是好医生012---How do you know the good ones..
哪个又会拿阴茎摩擦你的膝盖呢012---from the ones who'll push their penis against your knee?
什么012---Excuse me?
我知道她的意思012---I know what she's talking about.
我们要找个新的儿科医生012---Well,we've gotta find a new pediatrician.
罗斯昨晚不舒服012---Ross was getting sick last night,
艾玛或许也被感染到了012---and Emma may have caught it.
你为什么不去找格曼医生呢012---Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
罗斯说他去世了012---Ross said he died.
他才没去世012---He didn't die.
我上星期才遇到他女儿012---I just saw his daughter last week.
她说他很好012---She said he was fine.
但是她本人  可被肉毒杆菌搞惨了012---Her,on the other hand,botched Botox.
太好了  那我要带艾玛去找他012---Great. Well then,I'm gonna take Emma to see him.
为什么罗斯说他死了呢012---I wonder why Ross said that he died?
或许他把他012---Maybe he was getting him confused
跟他小时候的心理医生搞混了012---with his childhood therapist.
他看过心理医生012---He saw a therapist?
他以前常常做重复的噩梦012---He used to have a recurring nightmare.
吓死他了012---It freaked him out.
哇  什么噩梦呢012---Wow,what was it?
梦到我要吃掉他012---That I was going to eat him.
麦克012---Mike!
怎样012---Yeah?
好吧012---Okay.
真不敢相信  我竟然跟你做这事儿012---I can't believe I'm doing this with you.
我才刚结束一段九年的恋情012---Although I did just end a nineyear relationship..
所以我应该敞开胸怀  迎接一些挑战012---so I should be open to taking some risks.
一切都会没事的  好吗012---Everything is gonna be fine, ok?
按照我的指示就行012---Follow my lead.
你只要假装是麦克就可以了012---All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
我就是麦克啊 演的真不错012--- I am Mike.  Attaboy.
她们来了012---Here they come.
我是菲比012---I'm Phoebe.
嗨  菲比  我是麦克012---Hi. Phoebe. Mike.

在学校认识的 我们在大学认识的012--- From school.  We met in college.
我是说高中012---I mean high school.
那你们认识可久了012---You guys go way back,then.
那你现在是做什么的呢012---So,what are you up to these days?
我是律师 麦克  大律师噢012--- Well,I'm a lawyer.  Mike,attorney at law!
事实上  我才刚放弃执照  什么012--- Actually,I just gave up my practice.  What?
这种事你应该先跟我说一下的012---That's the kind of thing you usually run by me.
我一直想成为专业钢琴家012---I always want to play piano professionally.
如果现在不赶快做  就来不及了012---If I don't do this now,I never will.
太好了  我喜欢音乐家胜过律师012---Great. I like that better than the lawyer thing.
正因此我才一直等到现在012---Which is why I waited until now
才介绍麦克给你012---to introduce you to Mike.
你不是还以为他是律师吗012---You thought he was still a lawyer.
不  我并没有那样说012---No,that's not what I meant.

真的好奇怪012---It's so surprising that
你跟乔伊认识那么久了012---you and Joey have known each other for so long..

乔伊有几个姐妹呢012---How many sisters does Joey have?
6个 不  他有7个012--- Six.  No,he doesn't. He has seven.
你搞什么  我出了7个指头012---What are you doing? I said seven!
乔伊  为什么你要介绍陌生人给我呢012---Joey,why did you set me up with a stranger?
因为我忘记了约会的事012---Because I forgot about our date.
我很抱歉012---I'm so sorry.
我也很抱歉012---I'm sorry too.
另外要澄清一下 我没有开车撞他妈012---And just to be clear,I didn't hit his mother with a car.

你说得对012---You're right.
或许我不应该去012---Maybe I shouldn't go.
什么012---What?
南茜告诉我012---So Nancy told me about
有一个很棒的餐厅在招人   杰屋012---this job at this great restaurant,Javu?
离塔尔萨不太远012---But it's just a little outside of Tulsa.
那是多远呢012---Well,how far outside?
在曼哈顿012---Manhattan?
你要接受那份工作吗012---And you're thinking of taking it?
你之前说跟我在一起012---So, before,you said that being with me

我会想念这只手的012---I'm gonna miss this hand!
我知道这很过份012---I know this is a lot to ask..

如果你仔细想想012---Well,if you really think about it,
其实  4天并不是很长的时间012---I mean,four days is not that long.
星期一你去上班前我会见到你012---I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work..
然后星期四晚上我也会见到你012---and Thursday when you get back..
而我总是在星期二忙到很晚012---and I always work late on Tuesdays,
所以如果你仔细想想012---so really if you think about it..
事实上只有分开一天而已012---it's really just one day.
而如果我们连一天都撑不住012---And well,if we can't make it one day,
