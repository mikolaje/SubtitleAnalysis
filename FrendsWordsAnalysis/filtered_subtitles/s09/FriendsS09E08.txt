亲爱的  你可以帮我把盘子拿下来吗012---Hey,hon? Would you help me get the plates down?
好的  嘿  我有个主意012---Yeah. Hey,here's an idea.
今天用我们的结婚瓷器好不好012---Why don't we use our wedding china today?
不  我只是认为 我们应该把瓷器留到012---No,I just think we should save our china
真正特别的场合使用012---for something really special.
像是英国女王来访的时候012---Like if the queen of England comes over.
亲爱的  她一直爽约012---Honey,she keeps canceling on us.
你该懂那是什么意思012---Take the hint.
打破了怎么办呢  它们可是很贵的012---What if something breaks? They're expensive.
东西摆着不用  意义何在呢012---What is the point of having them if we never use them?
好吧  但是如果打破了012---Okay. But if something breaks
然后女王又要来访012---and then the queen comes over..
我会跟她解释的012---I will explain it to her.
你以为我会让你跟她说话啊012---Like I'd let you talk to the queen.
哇  今年的游行真是棒012---Wow,the parade is really good this year.
天啊  那些马还真能拉屎012---Man,those horses can crap.
下一个游行队伍是来自012---Next up is a marching band
奥克拉荷马州的马斯科吉012---from Muskogee,Oklahoma.
马斯科吉  离塔尔萨才四小时车程012---Muskogee? That's like four hours from Tulsa!
接下来是来自012---And here's the float with
日间肥皂剧《我们的日子》的众星们012---the stars of the popular daytime soap.. Days of Our Lives.
噢  我的天012---Oh,my God!
你不也参演了热门日间肥皂剧012---Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap
《我们的日子》吗012---Days of our Lives?
对啊  我忘了  我应该要参加游行的012---Yeah. I forgot! I'm supposed to be there!
我不敢相信我忘了012---I can't believe I forgot!
我通常会写在手臂上的012---I usually write stuff like this down on my arm!
该死的长袖衣服012---Stupid long sleeves!
你要怎么办呢012---What are you gonna do?
我得找个好借口说明012---I'll come up with a good reason..
我为什么没有到场012---why I wasn't there.
制作人一定会很生气012---The producers are gonna be mad.
他们昨天把我们叫进去说012---They sat us down and said:
"大家都要在早上六点整到012---"Everyone has to be there,6 a.m. sharp.
尤其是你  崔比安尼"012---That means you,Tribbiani."
好像我是什么笨蛋似的012---Like I was some kind of idiot.
你刚证明了他们是错的012---Well,you proved them wrong.
《老友记》  第九季 第8集  瑞秋的另一个妹妹012---Friends S09E08 The One With Rachel's Other Sister
噢  艾玛012---Oh,Emma.
这是你第一个感恩节012---This is your first Thanksgiving.
你要感谢什么呢012---What are you thankful for?
妈咪的乳房吗012---Mommy's boobies?
很多人都会感谢那东西的012---A lot of people are thankful for those.
嗨  瑞秋012---Hello? Rachel?
是谁012---Who is it?
是你最喜欢的妹妹012---It's your favorite sister.
吉儿  艾米012--- Jill?  Amy!
把我的戒指藏起来012---Hide my rings.
艾米  感恩节快乐012---Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
你有没有直发器呢012---Do you have a hair straightener?
直发器012---Hair straightener.
我好像一年没有见到你了012---I haven't seen you in,like,a year.
我知道  我知道  我忙坏了012---I know. I know. I've just been crazed.
噢  我也是  我生了小孩012---Well,me too. I had a baby.
我把爸的办公室重新装璜了一次012---I decorated Dad's office.
是吗  除非你把桌子从阴道挤出来012---Yeah? Well,unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina,
否则那可不能相提并论012---not the same thing.
听着  关于直发器的事012---Listen, about that hair straightener,
亲爱的  我真的需要012---honey,I really need one.
我要到我男朋友家用晚餐012---I'm gonna have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
噢  我的天012---Oh,my God.
那是艾美特吗012---Is this Emmett?
是艾玛012---It's Emma.
是个女孩012---It's a girl?
嗨  艾米012---Hey,Amy.
艾米  你记得罗斯吧012---Amy,you remember Ross?
不太记得012---Not really.
但是你比她之前的呆头鹅男友可爱多了012---But you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date.
那人就是我012---That was me.
不  他是高中时代的怪男生012---No,he was this creepy guy from high school
好像从九年级开始就很喜欢她的012---who had this huge crush on her since,like,the ninth grade.
那还是我012---Still me.
不  我不是在说你012---No,I'm not talking about you.
就是你那个胖朋友的哥哥012---It was your fat friend's brother
留着可笑的黑人头012---with that bad Afro.
好了  艾米  我来给你节省点时间吧012---Okay,Amy,I'm gonna save you some time,okay?
都是我012---All me!
小心  小心012---Careful. Careful.
小心012---Careful!
不如这样吧  下半辈子012---I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives..
我都会很小心  除非你另有指示012---I'll be careful until told otherwise.
这不是我们选的瓷器  我知道012--- This isn't the china we picked out.  I know.
你离开店里之后  我选了别的012---After you left the store,I chose different ones.
为什么  无意冒犯  亲爱的012--- Why?  No offense, honey.
你的品味对我而言太女性化了012---Your taste is a little feminine for me.
花朵图案就显得女性化吗012---Suddenly flowers are feminine?
嘿  大家好  感恩节快乐012---Hey,everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
感恩节快乐  菲比012---Happy Thanksgiving. Phoebe!
怎么了  乔伊012---What's going on,Joe?
听着  我需要编个天衣无缝的谎012---Listen,I need a good lie.
好的012---Okay.
"阿波罗登月"那个谎言如何012---How about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing,you know?
根本就可以看到线  愚民们012---You can see the strings,people!
不  不  我需要一个谎言来解释012---No,no,no. I need a good lie to explain
为什么我今天错过了一件工作上的事012---why I wasn't at a work thing today.
亲爱的  你说谎技术烂透了012---Honey,you stink at lying.
才不是呢012---I do not.
是吗  让我问你012---Really? Let me ask you something.
昨天发生在咖啡屋的事012---Yesterday at the coffeehouse..
我去上厕所012---I went to the bathroom.
回来的时候  我的松饼就不见了012---When I came back,my muffin was gone.
是谁拿走的012---Who took it?
有人打开咖啡屋的大门012---Somebody opened the door to the coffeehouse..
然后一只浣熊就跑进来012---and a raccoon ran in
直接拿走你的松饼  我说012---and went straight for your muffin. I said:
"嘿  不能吃  那是菲比的"012---"Hey,don't eat that! That's Phoebe's!"
然后他说012---And he said..
他说"乔伊  你说谎技术烂透了"012---He said,"Joey,you stink at lying."
我该怎么办呢012---What am I gonna do?
别担心  我们会想个好谎言的012---Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.
我会帮你练习的012---I'll help you practice.
太好了  太棒了  谢谢你012---Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
没问题  你错过了什么工作的事012---Sure. What was the work thing?
"到机场接奶奶"  噢  天啊012--- "Pick up Grandma at the airport."  Oh,man!
她真是我的心肝宝贝012---She's precious.
你会不会担心012---Do you ever worry
她会遗传到你整容前的鼻子012---that she's gonna get your real nose?
艾米012---Amy..
是的  我会  我真的担心012---Yes,I do. I really do.
喂012---Hello?
是  等一下 我可以到楼上讲吗012---Yeah,hang on,one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
当然  我们不住在楼上  但是012---Sure. We don't live there,but..
不是吧  只有这几间房间012---Seriously? It's just these rooms?
我以为你是有钱的医生（博士）呢012---I thought you were a doctor.
不  罗斯有博士学位012---Yeah. No,Ross has a Ph.D.
天啊  她简直不可理喻012---God,she is unbelievable.
对啊  博士学位就跟医学学位一样好啊012---I know. I mean,a Ph.D. is just as good as an MD.
是噢  罗斯  对啊012---Sure,Ross,yeah!
如果我在餐厅心脏病发012---If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,
我会希望你带着化石刷站在一边012---I want you there with your fossil brush.
该死的感恩节  怎么了012--- Stupid Thanksgiving.  What?
怎么了  发生什么事012---What? What happened?
我男朋友取消跟我的约会了012---My boyfriend canceled on me.
我好不容易才找到一段真感情012---I mean,I finally find a real relationship.
一个可以跟我共度今天的人012---Someone that I can spend this day with,
然后他老婆竟然回来了012---and then his wife comes back into town!
我发誓  跟已婚男人约会真是不值得012---I swear,it's almost not even worth dating married guys.
别这样说012---Don't say that.
天啊  我本来很期待今天的012---God,I was so looking forward to this.
本来会是很美好的感恩节的012---It was gonna be such a beautiful Thanksgiving.
我们本来要吃寿司的012---We were gonna have sushi.
艾米  别哭012---Amy,don't cry.
罗斯  我可以私下跟你谈谈吗012---Ross,can I talk to you in private?
当然  你想要去楼上或是012---Sure,you wanna go upstairs,or..?
听着  我在想  如果莫妮卡不介意的话012---Look,I was thinking,if it's okay with Monica..
我想邀请艾米跟我们共度感恩节012---I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
我认为这是个好主意012---You know, I think that's a great idea.
就像清教徒012---It'll be like the Pilgrims
把梅毒带给美国印地安人一样012---bringing the Indians syphilis.
听着  我知道她有点难搞012---Look,I know she's a little tough to take.
但是  她没有其他地方可以去了012---But she has nowhere else to go,
而且她是我妹妹  是艾玛的阿姨012---and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.
我希望她们相处融洽012---And I would like them to bond.
好吧  但我不想她们相处太融洽012---Ok, fine. I don't want them bonding too much.
我不要她告诉艾玛说  她需要鼻部整形012---I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
罗斯  她很可能会需要的012---Ross,she may need one.
我们也只能接受了012---We're just gonna have to make our peace with that!
嘿  大伙儿  这是我妹妹艾米012---Hey,you guys. This is my sister,Amy.
这是钱德  乔伊  菲比012---This is Chandler,Joey,Phoebe,
还有你认识的莫妮卡012---and you know Mon.
噢  我的天012---Oh,my God.
你有演《我们的日子》012---You're on Days of Our Lives!
是的012---Yeah.
哇  他们一定是帮你化很浓的妆012---Wow! They must put a lot of makeup on you.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving.
欢迎  这是你第一次见到艾玛吗012---So welcome. Is this the first time you're seeing Emma?
是的  我想是的012---Yeah,I think so.
很高兴认识你  艾玛012---It's nice to meet you,Emma.
菲比  声音真好玩012--- Phoebe.  That's a funny noise.
菲比  我还需要你帮忙  好的012--- Phoebe? I still need some help here.  Right. Okay.
不止是你说的谎言本身012---So it's not just the lie you tell,
你说的方式也很重要  例如012---but it's the way you tell it. For example..
如果你说谎的时候看着地上012---if you look at the ground when you're talking,
人们就知道你在说谎012---people know you're lying.
我不知道为什么说谎对我如此困难012---I don't know why this is so hard for me.
说谎基本上就跟演戏一样012---Lying is basically just acting..
而我可是演技精湛的演员012---and I am a terrific actor.
你是演技"精湛"的演员012---You are a terrific actor.
嘿  宝宝在哪呢012---Hey. Where's the baby?
我们刚把她抱去睡了012---We just put her down for a nap.
听着  我刚刚在想012---Listen,I was just thinking.
你们知道什么会很棒吗012---You know what would be incredible?
就是如果你们死了012---If you guys died!
谢谢你  艾米012---Thank you,Amy.
不  然后我就可以得到宝宝012---No,no,then I would get the baby.
就像是电影情节一样012---It would be just like a movie.
刚开始我会全无头绪012---At first I wouldn't know what to do with her.
然后时机来临时012---And then I would rise to the occasion.
我会完全改变  然后结婚012---Then I'd get a makeover and get married.
真棒的电影012---That's a great movie!
听着  反正你们也不能阻止我012---Now,listen,not that you guys could stop me or anything..
因为你们已经死了012---because you know,you'd be dead.
但是我想要帮她改名字012---But I was thinking about changing her name.
我就是不大喜欢艾米丽012---I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
艾玛012---Emma.
艾玛  罗斯在叫你012---Emma? Ross wants you.
菲比012---Phoebe!
她为什么一直发出那种怪声呢012---Why does she keep making that noise?
亲爱的  我不知道要如何告诉你012---Honey,I don't know how to tell you this..
但如果我跟罗斯发生了什么事012---but if something were to happen to Ross or myself..
你不会得到宝宝的012---you wouldn't get the baby.
那  谁会呢012---Well,who would?
我们还没有正式问过他们012---Well,we haven't officially asked them yet..
但我们希望是莫妮卡跟钱德012---but we would want Monica and Chandler.
我不敢相信你们要我们抚养艾玛012---I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
噢  我的天  我真是太感动了012---Oh,my God,I'm so moved.
我不敢相信  等一下  你们死了012---I don't believe this. Hold on a second. You guys die..
然后宝宝不是我的012---and I don't get your baby?
艾米  我们跟莫妮卡跟钱德比较亲近012---Amy,see,we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.
我们每天都见面012---We see them every day.
而且老实说  你好像也不太亲近宝宝012---And truthfully,you don't seem connected to the baby.
亲近  亲近什么  她只是一堆肉012---Connected? To what? She's a lump.
我必须跟你们说  这对我意义重大012---You know,guys,I've gotta say this means so much to me.
我是说  你们肯相信我012---I mean,that you would trust me
把孩子托付给我012---with your child.
大家都知道莫妮卡跟我一直试着012---I mean,we all know that Monica and I have been..
想要生小孩012---trying to have a baby of our own.
我也有怀疑过  自己当父亲的能力012---You know,I've had my doubts about my skills as a father,
但是  你们两个012---but.. that you two..
你们两个  这个人吗012--- That you two..  This guy?
真的吗012---Seriously?
好了  晚餐时间到了012---Okay,it's time for dinner.
各位  我们将使用我们的高档瓷器012---Everyone,we're using our fancy china..
它们是很贵的  所以请小心012---and it's very expensive,so please be careful.
好了  再说明一次012---Okay,just to be clear,
不要拿这些盘子开玩笑012---comedy with the plates will not be wellreceived.
为什么我的盘子不如别人的高档012---How come my plate's less fancy than everyone else's?
你不信任我  不让我用你的高档餐盘吗012---Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
不  亲爱的  那是特别的盘子012---No,honey. That's a special plate.
其实是一个游戏012---See,it's a game.
拿到那盘子的人就是赢家012---Whoever gets that plate wins.
我不敢相信我赢了012---I can't believe I won!
简直就像狠狠扇了我一耳光012---You know,this is such a slap in the face.
我是说  我是你妹妹012---I mean,I'm your sister..
你却把宝宝给这些陌生人  而不给我012---and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
莫妮卡是罗斯的妹妹012---Monica is Ross' sister.
不  罗斯的妹妹很肥的012---No,Ross' sister was really fat.
那就是我012---That was me.
不  她上学时是个蠢蠢的女生012---No,she was this dorky girl in school
就像小狗一样跟着瑞秋012---who followed Rachel around like a puppy..
艾米  你不能再这样了012---Amy,you've got to stop doing that!
好了  我知道你现在正在经历家庭危机012---Okay,listen,I know you're having a bit of a family crisis..
但你不需要把气出在盘子身上012---but you don't have to take it out on the plates.
其实我认为每个人012---I mean,in fact,I think that everyone..
都应该这样切食物012---should cut their food like this:
瞧见了吗012---Now,see?
像这样  不只可以保护盘子012---This way,you protect the plates..
而且老实说  还挺好玩的012---and let's face it,you have fun.
好吧  那这样呢  如果你们死了012---Okay,how about this? If you guys die..
而且疯狂盘子女士也死了012---and the crazy plate lady dies..
那我可以得到宝宝吗012---then do I get the baby?
不  如果疯狂盘子女012---No,if crazy plate lady..
如果莫妮卡死了012---If Monica dies,
那艾玛就是我的了  对吗012---then I would get Emma. Right?
其实  其实怎样012--- Well,actually..  Actually what?
只是  如果是那样的话012---It's just.. It's just that in that case..
那艾玛就去跟我父母一起生活012---then Emma would go to my parents.
什么  很伤心  对不对012--- What?  Hurts,doesn't it?
我要等谁死了才能得到她012---Who has to die for me to get her?
所以如果莫妮卡不在了012---So if Monica's not around,
我就没有资格抚养艾玛了012---I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
不  我们不是这个意思012---No,that is not what we're saying.
他在说谎  他看了地上012---Yeah,he's lying. He looked down.
我有什么不好的呢  我无法胜任吗012---Well,what's wrong with me? Am I incompetent?
最后活下来的可是我012---Because I managed to survive
弄死你们三个的事故  没有弄死我012---whatever it is that killed the three of you!
你可能有点误会012---You're taking this the wrong way.
我们认为你会是很好的父亲012---We think you are going to be a wonderful parent.
只是你是比较风趣的父亲012---It's just.. You're more the,you know,fun parent.
是的  我们希望艾玛012---Yeah,and we wanna make sure that Emma
也有像莫妮卡这样的人照顾012---also has someone like Monica..
比较有纪律的人012---who's more of a disciplinarian.
比较坚定  严格的人012---Someone who can be firm and strict.
你们对我的感觉不是真的那样吧012---That's not how you see me,is it?
不  你真的很有趣012---No,you're all about the fun.
我或许不是很了解宝宝012---I may not know a lot about babies,
但是你们真的认为我没有能力吗012---but do you really think I'm not capable?
不  你们两个能力相当012---No. You both are equally capable.
只不过你们在一起的时候是最强的012---It's just you're strongest when you're together.
好的  如果我们一起得到艾玛012---Okay. So if we both had Emma,
然后我死了012---and I died..
她也不能拥有她012---she'd have to give her up.
当然  莫妮卡也必须把她让出来012---Sure. Monica would have to give her up.
我说谎说的至少比他好  对吧012---I lie better than that,right?
让我说清楚012---Let me just get this straight.
如果我的两个朋友死了  我得到艾玛012---So my two friends die,I get Emma.
然后我老婆死了  那艾玛012---Then my wife dies. Then Emma,
我生命中剩下的唯一一小块希望012---the one tiny ray of hope left in my life..
也会从我身边被带走012---gets taken away from me?
真是精彩的好电影012---There's your movie.
嘿  你在这里012---Hey,there you are.
你晚餐之后就消失了012---You disappeared after dinner.
有人想念我吗012---Did somebody miss me?
有婴儿需要被无能的父亲抚养长大吗012---Was there a child to raise poorly?
罗斯跟瑞秋根本不知道在瞎说什么012---Ross and Rachel don't know what they're saying.
他们自己也不是多有责任感012---It's not like they're so responsible.
艾玛只不过是一瓶红酒012---Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot
跟一个过期保险套的意外产物012---and a fiveyearold condom.
不  他们是对的012---No,but they're right.
我不是个坚强的父亲  我永远都不会是012---I'm not a strong father figure,and I never will be.
不  这些是要学习的012---No,you learn these things.
你会逐渐学会的012---You grow into it.
是的  但那就不是我了012---Yeah,but it's not who I am.
他们说的一切012---Everything they said
都是我担心有小孩之后  会面对的问题012---is exactly why I was worried about having a kid.
是真的012---And it's true.
而且  大家都知道012---And look,everybody knows it.
我不知道012---I don't know it.
我要跟你生小孩因为012---I wanna have a kid with you because
我认为你会是很棒的父亲012---I think you'll be an amazing dad.
不管是风趣还是有纪律012---At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
那你可以想像我说012---Well,can you picture me saying,
"回房去  你被禁足了"吗012---"Go to your room,you're grounded"?
你可以想像我说"你被禁足了"吗012---Can you hear me say,"You're grounded"?
你上星期才那样对我说过012---You said that to me last week.
是有多难做到012---How hard is it?
我叫你不要穿着鞋子踏在家具上012---"No shoes on the furniture!"
制作人刚刚留言012---The producer from Days left a message
问我为什么没有参加游行012---asking why I wasn't at the parade.
他说大家都对我很不爽012---They said everybody's really pissed off at me.
