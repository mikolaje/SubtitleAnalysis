-嘿  -嗯  好啦  当然012---- Hey.  - Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.
我们能不能谈谈012---Look, can we talk about
昨晚这里的发生的事012---what happened here last night?
行  先给我几秒钟012---Sure. Just give me a second
让我进入你那愤怒又诡异的状态012---to get all huffy and weird like you.
你敢相信某某人在昨天晚在这012---You believe that whoever did something last night
做了某某事要么没做某某事  有没有搞错012---did what they did or didn't do? Come on!
你真不了解我说的是什么012---Okay, you really don't know what I'm talking about?
-不知道  -好  昨天晚上的派对之后012---- No.  - Okay. Last night, after the party...
我看到瑞秋在你家的阳台上012---I saw Rachel kissing that jerk
亲她那个混蛋同事012---from her office out on your balcony.
在我家阳台  真的吗012---Our balcony? Seriously?
这可好玩了  我就和莫妮卡说012---That's so funny. I told Monica
我们应该在阳台上加个灯的012---we should put lights on our balcony
可她说不用  外面那么冷  没人会去012---and she said, ''No, no. It's too cold.
然后我说012---Nobody will go out there.'' And I said:
要是我们加个灯或许就有人会去了012---'Maybe if we put some lights out there they will.
对  我过来就是要和你谈这事012---Right, that's what I came over to talk about.
我看到瑞秋在你家阳台上亲了一个男人012---I saw Rachel kissing some guy.
虽然那里连灯都没有012---on your balcony, even though there were no lights!
那你要跟她谈谈吗012---So are you gonna talk to her?
为什么  为什么我要012---Why? Why should I?
如果她要找寻新生活  没关系012---I mean, if she wants to move on, that's fine.
这么说没关系  真有说服力012---You know when ''that's fine'' sounds true?
喷着口水用力吼012---When someone yells it and spits.
不  我认真的012---No, I'm serious.
如果她想要跟别人约会012---I mean, if she wants to date people,
没关系  我不在乎012---fine. I don't care.
但是至少她要跟我说啊012---But at least she could have told me.
我已经完全不顾个人生活012---You know, I've been putting my life on hold
集中全部精力在艾玛身上了012---and concentrating on Emma.
但如果她想要出去随便亲男人012---But if she wants to go out there kissing guys
那我也要去012---she barely knows, then so will I.
真好笑  罗斯是同志012---Very funny! Ross is gay!
没  很好  所以你也要有新的生活了012---No, no. Good, so you're moving on.
你准备怎么过新生活012---Do you have any idea where you're moving on to?
我机会多的很呢012---I've got plenty of opportunities.
就刚刚在咖啡厅里  有个女人对我笑呢012---Just now, there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me.
还有一天在地铁  有个女人012---And then the other day on the subway, a woman
不小心  坐到我的手上了012---''accidentally'' sat on my hand.
老兄  别跟我炫耀你疯狂的单身生活了012---Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life.
还有  在学校有个人类学家012---And there's an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me
跨部门餐会的时候 不停勾搭我012---during the interdepartmental potluck dinner.
我为什么要结婚啊012---Why did I get married?
《老友记》  第九季 第13集  莫妮卡唱歌记012---Friends S09E13 The One Where Monica Sings
问你们一个问题012---Hey, let me ask you guys something.
我明天要拍新艺术照012---I'm having new headshots taken tomorrow.
摄影师说012---The photographer said she thinks
我应该修修眉毛012---I should have my eyebrows waxed.
男生修眉会不会很怪012---Is that weird for a guy?
-嗯  那要看情况  -什么情况012---- Well, it depends.  - On?
看他的变性手术做到哪个阶段了012---On how far along he is in the sex-change process.
不  我完全不同意012---No, I totally disagree.
我觉得男生那样做没有什么012---I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that.
尤其是演员012---Especially an actor.
我不是说你有那个必要  你的眉毛…012---I mean, not that you need to. Your eyebrows are....
你们别这样  别盯着我看  吓着我了012---Stop it, you guys. Stop staring, you're freaking me out.
你手指头也毛茸茸的012---Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.
天啊  现在我还要除这些毛吗012---Oh, man, now I have to get those done too?
哇  你要做的改造可不少啊012---Wow, talk about high maintenance.
你还不是染发012---You dye your hair.
-我是女人啊  -双重标准012---- I'm a woman.  - Double standards!
差点忘记 你今晚去迈克的钢琴酒吧吗012---Before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
只要不让我上台唱歌就去012---Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
但是大家都要唱歌啊  很好玩的012---But everybody sings. It's so fun.
上次有个可爱的老先生上台012---Last time, this adorable old man got up there,
歌词全忘了  糗呆了012---forgot all the words, flipped out
然后大家就嘘他下台  太好玩了012---and everyone booed him off the stage. It was so funny.
我不是很会唱歌012---Look, I'm not good at singing.
怎么啦  你害怕了012---Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
怕我唱的比你好吗012---You afraid I'm a better singer?
怕我会用歌声把你打得落花流水012---You afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
不是  这招对我没用012---Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.
哇  我一定是长大了012---Wow, I must be growing up.
好吧  就过来支持迈克就好了012---Okay, fine. Just please come and support Mike.
你不需要唱歌012---You don't have to sing.
所以我又不用唱歌012---So I don't have to sing,
而且还可以坐在那里评论别人012---and I can just sit there and pass judgment on others?
-还可以一边喝酒  -我要去012---- While drinking.  - I'm there.
你们好 我需要你们的帮忙012---Hi, you guys. Listen, I really need your help.
我想我做了一件很蠢的事012---I think I did something really stupid.
是  瑞秋  但至少结果还是很漂亮的012---Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something so beautiful out of it.
不  不是那件事  我昨晚亲了盖文012---No, not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
-我的天  -你亲了他012---- My God.  -You kissed him?
对  就在派对结束之后 我们在阳台上012---Yeah, it was after the party, we were on the balcony
等等  我一直都在家012---Wait, wait, wait. I was at home the whole time.
为什么没看到012---How did I miss that?
派对才刚结束 你可能正忙着烫平包装纸012---Well, it was the end of the party. You were probably ironing wrapping paper.
哦  没错012---Oh, yeah.
那你们怎么会亲起来的呢012---So how did you end up kissing?
我们单独在一起  然后他又很体贴012---We were all alone and he was being really nice...
然后又送我这条围巾012---and he gave me this scarf.
我以为你讨厌他012---I thought you hated him.
看来爱与恨之间只有一线之隔012---Well, there is a thin line between love and hate...
而结果  那条线就是这围巾012---...and it turns out that line is a scarf.
你想要跟这男的交往吗012---Are you thinking of starting something up with this guy?
不知道  太复杂了  我和他一起工作012---I don't know. lt's so complicated. I work with this guy.
我已经有小孩  还有罗斯012---I have the baby, and I have Ross.
我不知道该怎么办012---I don't know what to do.
而我再十分钟就要进办公室见到盖文了012---And I have to be at the office and see Gavin in 10 minutes.
听起来你应该想想012---Sounds like you need to think about
要怎么跟盖文说了012---what you want and talk to Gavin.
而且你一定得要跟罗斯谈谈012---And you definitely should talk to Ross.
或者…012---Or...
我可以打电话请病假  那就都不用管了012---...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all.
请了五个月的产假  才回去上了四天班012---Wow! Five months maternity leave, you're back for four days...
亲了一个同事  又要请病假012---kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
他们有你这个员工真幸运012---They are lucky to have you.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hi.  - Hi.
我预约了修眉012---I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
什么姓名012---Name?
钱德勒·宾012---Chandler Bing.
好的  很好012---Okay, very good.
请先坐一下  宾先生012---Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
桑妮亚很快就过来012---and Sonya will be right with you.
好的  谢谢012---Okay. Thanks.
我碰了下那玩意儿012---I touched the stuff.
让我来处理012---I'll take care of it.
谢谢012---Thanks.
来你们… 你们这里的男生多吗012---So do you...? Do you get a lot of guys in here?
-当然  -太好了012---- Oh, absolutely.  - Oh, good.
你想认识认识吗012---You looking to meet somebody?
好了  我们开始吧012---All right, let's just do this.
好的  我们等一下再上热蜡012---Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.
首先我要先拔一些杂毛  好吗012---First, I want to tweeze some of the strays, okay?
这可能会有点痛012---Now, this may sting just a little bit.
你随意  我可是一点都不怕痛的012---Please, I have an extremely high threshold
妈妈咪啊   喔  我的脸  我的脸012---Holy Mother of God! Oh, my face! My face!
我没事  我没事  我没事012---I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.
只是有点吓到  没什么012---It's just a bit of shock, that's all.
-但是我没事  你可以继续了 -好的012---- But I'll be fine. You can go again.   - Okay.
抱歉012---Sorry.
可恶  你这女人012---Damn it, woman!
全纽约最适合结婚的单身汉来了012---It's the most eligible man in New York.
新生活进行得如何呢012---How's the moving on going?
不太好  地铁上又有个人坐到我的手012---Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand...
但是这个人既不是女性 也没有穿内裤012---but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
或许你完全错估情势了  我是说你想想看012---Maybe you're going about this the wrong way. I mean, think about it:
单身白种男性  离婚三次012---Single white male, divorced three times,
有两个非婚生子女012---two illegitimate children.
你应该要自己心里有数的012---The personal ad writes itself.
真是好笑  是啊012---You know, that's funny. Yeah.
那你觉得你这辈子会找到工作吗012---So do you think you'll ever work again?
你在干嘛   你知道我们会斗个没完的012---What are you doing? You know I can only dish it out.
我不敢相信瑞秋就这样抛下过去012---I can't believe Rachel just moved on
而且还什么都没有跟我说012---and didn't say anything to me.
或许她并没有抛下012---Maybe she didn't move on.
或许那只是冲动之下吻的012---Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
过生日才发生一次的那种012---one-time birthday thing.
不  一个月以前  她还把电话号码012---No, a month ago,
留给一个在酒吧认识的男的012---she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
她有跟他出去吗012---Did she go out with him?
没有  他打电话来时012---No. When he called
我把留言扔了012---I threw the message away.
真是厉害啊012---The high road.
你知道吗  够了012---All right, you know what? Enough.
抱怨够了  我要展开新生活了012---Enough talking. I have to get moving.
瞧瞧那两个金发美女  跟我一起过去012---Hey, check out those two blonds over there. Hey, come with me.
你要害每个人都离婚吗012---Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
不是让你真泡妞012---You don't have to do anything.
但是我们两个一起过去会比较好012---It'll just be easier if it's two of us.
就像大学一样  记得吗012---Like college, remember?
你先过去说笑话热场面012---First, you break the ice with some kind of a joke
让她们知道你是好玩的人012---so they know you're the funny one.
然后我再插入有趣的话题012---I swoop in with interesting conversation...
让她们知又道我才是既聪明  有教养还性感012---so they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one.
我还以为笑话都是我来讲012---I thought I got to make the jokes.
你不用上班吗012---Don't you have to be at work?
拜托  走吧012---Oh, come on.
你们好  我叫钱德勒012---Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.
这是我朋友罗斯012---This is my friend Ross right here.
我们在想012---We were wondering
如果你们加入012---if you're up for it,
我们就只差六个人来玩人体金字塔了012---we only need six more people for a human pyramid.
接手  接手012---Swoop. Swoop.
我注意到你在看报纸012---Hey, I notice you're reading the paper.
欧洲又有水灾了  对吗012---Another flood in Europe, huh?
问你们个问题012---Here's a question:
你宁愿被淹死还是被活活烧死012---Would you rather drown or be burned alive?
-很抱歉  我们要走了  -好的012---- I'm sorry, we're just leaving. - Okay.
宝刀未老012---We still got it.
谁012---Who is it?
盖文  我带一些汤来给你012---Gavin. I brought you some soup.
-为什么   -我听说你生病了012---- Why? - I heard you were sick.
喔  对  等一下 让我先整理一下012---Oh, right! Hold on, let me just clean up in here a little bit.
你好  盖文012---Hello, Gavin.
今天上班好想你  你还好吗012---I missed you at work. How you feeling?
不想对你说谎  我病得很重012---I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
那就好  因为我还担心012---Oh, good. Because I was having a totally paranoid moment
你是在装病逃避我012---where I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
不是  不是012---Oh, no, no, no.
我昨晚很愉快012---So I had fun last night.
我也是012---So did I.
你的病到底传染性有多高呢012---Exactly how contagious is this thing you have?
是因为站在阳台上受凉了012---Is it a cold from standing on the balcony,
还是被猴子咬了呢012---or did a monkey bite you?
-只是单纯的感冒  -有发烧吗012---- It's just a cold.  - Do you have a fever?
让我看看012---Let me see.
怎么  怎么了  怎么回事012---What? What is it? What's the matter?
那张照片  罗斯在对你做什么012---What's Ross doing to you in that picture?
他在用化石刷子帮我除尘012---Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.
他觉得那样很好玩012---He thought it would be funny.
-是啊  -是的012---- Right. Right.  - Yeah.
-罗斯  -是啊012---- Ross. - Yeah.
你们之间有什么吗012---What's the deal with you guys?
我不想当第三者012---I don't wanna get in the middle of anything.
你不是第三者012---You're not getting in the middle of anything.
别担心罗斯012---Don't worry about Ross.
快躲  是罗斯  躲起来012---Hide! That's Ross! Hide!
躲起来012---Hide! Hide!
但是你说不用担心012---Yeah, but you said not to worry
我撒谎  而且我也没有生病012---I lied and I'm not sick either!
躲到窗廉后面012---Just stay behind the curtain!
-嗨  -是莫莉啊  不是罗斯012---- Hi.  - Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.
不是  我来接艾玛到你妈家  记得吗012---No. I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
对  是的  是的012---Right. Yes, yes.
-千万别慌  -怎么了012---- Don't panic.  - What?
有个男人藏在你家窗帘后头012---There is a man behind your curtain.
我皮包里有防狼喷雾012---I have Mace in my purse.
不  没关系  不用012---No, that's okay! No, no, no.
那是我同事盖文在发神经012---This is my business associate Gavin being silly.
出来吧  别站那012---Come out from behind there.
你好  我叫盖文  很高兴认识你012---Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.
是我要站在那里的012---It was my idea to stand there.
-你好  我去带艾玛  -好的012---- Hello. I'll just go get Emma.  - Okay.
那么…012---So...
为什么我要躲呢012---why did I have to hide?
我以为那是罗斯012---I thought it was Ross.
如果真是又如何012---So what if it was?
我以为你们之间已经没有什么了012---I thought there was nothing going on between you.
是没有  完全没有012---There isn't. There totally isn't.
你听到钥匙转动的声音012---You hear keys in the hall
就像斗牛第一次出栏一样跳了起来012---and you jump like a bronco coming out of the chute for the first time.
我做过牛仔小丑012---I used to be a rodeo clown.
好的  听着  盖文012---All right, Iook, Gavin
我觉得是  你在这里让我有罪恶感012---I guess I felt guilty that you were here
我也不想的012---which I shouldn't.
罗斯跟我没又有在交往012---You know, Ross and I are not in a relationship
但他是我孩子的父亲  而且我们住在一起012---but he is the father of my child. And, you know
再加上  我们有太多过去了012---we do live together. And plus, there's just so much history, you know?
只是…  我不知道012---It's just-- I don't know.
我很抱歉  脑子很乱012---I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.
没关系012---It's okay.
这或许与我无关012---It's probably not my place,
但是我可以给你一个建议吗012---but can I give you a piece of advice?
好的012---Yes.
你应该跟罗斯谈谈这件事012---I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
大家都这样说012---People keep saying that.
我很抱歉  盖文012---I'm sorry, Gavin.
别抱歉012---Don't be.
只是现在不是好时机012---It's just bad timing.
讲真的吗  牛仔小丑012---So seriously, rodeo clown?
技术最棒的  小姐  技术最棒的012---One of the best, ma'am. One of the best.
没有时间留给失败012---"No time for losers,
因为我们是真正的冠军012---'cause we are the champions of the world...!"
谢谢012---Thank you!
她是我女朋友  大家不用这么做012---Oh, she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here.
我要休息一下  回来时012---I'm gonna take a little break, and when we come back
肯尼将要演唱《自摸》012---.we've got Kenneth singing ''I Touch Myself.''
我就不做评论了012---I'm not here to judge.
你一定要上台唱012---You have got to sing.
不  我告诉过你我不行012---No, I told you I can't.
你会很喜欢的  而且你的嗓子很好啊012---But you would have so much fun. And you have a really nice voice.
你什么时候听过我唱歌012---When have you heard me sing?
常常  当你在煮饭的时候012---All the time, when you're cooking.
-什么  -是啊  你总是哼哼着012---- What?  - Yeah, you're always singing:
好吃  好吃  好吃 我肚肚里有爱爱012---Yummy, yummy, yummy I've got love in my tummy
是啊  那个我还挺拿手的012---Yeah, I do rock that one.
你难道一点都不想要上去唱吗012---Isn't there just a little part of you that wants to get up there?
一点而已  老天  好可怕012---Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.
我根本不知道要唱什么012---I don't even know what I would sing.
嗯  我有歌本012---Well, I've got a book around
《德耳塔·道恩》012---''Delta Dawn.''
我不得不注意到012---Hi. I couldn't help but notice,
你的项链好特别012---but that's an unusual necklace.
你一个小时前就来搭讪过了012---You already hit on me an hour ago.
没错  所以确定不行吗012---Right. So that's a firm no?
不敢相信  我一直被判出局012---I don't believe this. I just keep striking out.
我也不敢相信012---I don't get it either.
我是说  很明显地你是很饥渴了012---I mean, you're obviously desperate.
你问女人想怎么死012---You're asking women how they wanna be killed.
太棒了  瑞秋继续去亲男人012---This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys
直到找到她想要的男人 而我将孤单地死去012---...until she finds the one she wants, and I'm gonna die alone.
是淹死还是…012---By drowning or...?
他为什么要跟我分手012---Why would he break up with me?
我不知道  亲爱的012---I don't know, sweetie.
我要的只不过是爱他  希望他也爱我012---All I ever wanted was to just love him and have him love me back.
我有这么不可爱吗012---I mean, am I so unlovable?
-哇  -我懂012---- Wow. - I know.
好了  以上是肯尼所带来的012---All right. That was Kenneth with his
现场演绎的《自摸》012---much too literal rendition of ''I Touch Myself.''
接下来是莫妮卡演唱012---Coming up next, we've got Monica singing
《德耳塔·道恩》012---''Delta Dawn.''
等等  我不能在这些人面前唱012---Wait. I can't sing in front of all these people.
假装他们不在  没关系的012---Just pretend they're not even here. It's okay.
聚光灯一打到你身上  亮得耀眼012---Once that spotlight hits you, it's so bright,
你也看不到任何人012---you won't see anyone anyway.
我叫莫妮卡  我要唱的是《德耳塔·道恩》012---Hi, I'm Monica. And l'm going to be singing ''Delta Dawn.''
德耳塔·道恩  你手上拿的是什么花012---"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
是随过去岁月褪色的玫瑰...012---Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
你可以看穿她的上衣吗012---Can you totally see through her shirt?
像X光一样012---Like an x-ray.
今天不穿内衣可倒霉了012---Bad day not to wear a bra.
带你一起去他天上的殿堂012---"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
我需要你的帮忙012---I need your help.
看起来很严重012---Wow, it seems serious.
出什么问题了  艾希莉·贾德012---What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
我要去拍艺术照  所以去修了眉毛012---I'm getting new headshots taken. So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.

什么留言我该收  什么不该收012---what messages I should or should not get?!
-我是谁  -是啊012---- Who am I?  -Yes
我是在你去酒吧认识男人的时候012---I'm the guy who's taking care of our baby...
在家照顾我们的孩子的人012---while you're at bars meeting guys!
我真不敢相信012---I cannot believe you.

但我不能跟会藏我留言012---But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages
还会带疯女人回我公寓的人谈012---and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
正常的人没有一个要跟我回来012---Hey, none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me!
这不是重点好吗  重点是012---That's not the point, okay? The point is
是你抛下我们的过去  而你却没有说012---you are the one who moved on and didn't tell anyone.
天啊  罗斯  这真是糟透了012---Oh, God, Ross, this is just so messed up.

你们住在一起  还不是夫妻012---''You live together, but you're not a couple,
但是你们又有小孩  不是很奇怪吗012---yet you have a baby? Isn't that weird?''
我会说  不会  我们都没问题012---And I say, ''No. It's not, because it works for us.''
但是你知道吗  是有问题的012---But you know what? This doesn't work.
事实上  还正好相反咧012---ln fact, this is the opposite of working.
的确如此012---Clearly.
你也知道012---And you know...
我们有说过只要一切没问题012---we said that we would live together
我们就会一直住在一起012---as long as this makes sense
然而  或许一切不再是没问题了012---and maybe this just doesn't make sense anymore.
是啊  或许不再是了012---Yeah, maybe not.
那你想要怎样呢012---So, what do you wanna do?
嗨012---Hi.
我跟艾玛可以过来住一阵子吗012---Can Emma and I live here for a while?
天啊012---God.

但我帮他喝了他的酒012---but I helped him drink his wine."
所以不管怎样  你都会自摸012---So you'll just touch yourself for anything, then?
