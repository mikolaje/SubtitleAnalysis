因为汗滴到我眼睛里了  疼得慌012---'Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.
谢谢  拿去吧012--- Thank you.  There.
你这是什么  应该还没有正规的命名012--- So, what are you?  I don't think they have a name for it.
我一紧张就会满身大汗012---I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.
不  我是指你的服装  我扮成了太阳系012--- No, I meant your costume.  I'm a solar system.
是我的学生们帮我做的  我教二年级012---Yeah, my students helped me make it. I teach the second grade.
我可喜欢二年级了  真的吗012--- I love the second grade.  Really?
比一年级好多了012---Yeah! It's so much better than first grade
一年级什么也不懂012---when you don't know what's going on
也比三年级好012---and definitely better than third grade.

如果猫女跟女超人打架  谁会赢呢012---Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
当然是猫女  是吧012--- Catwoman, hands down.  Yeah.
但你跟菲比  我赌菲比会赢012---Between you and Phoebe ? I'd give the edge to Phoebe.
什么  真的吗  你开什么玩笑012--- What? Really?  You kidding?
菲比在街上混过  好吗012---Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
而且她生起气来跟疯婆子一样012---Plus, she's got a crazy temper.
她没有站在我后面吧012---She's not right behind me, is she?
不  你很安全012---No, you're fine.
我能打倒瑞秋吗  我不确定012--- Could I take Rachel?  I'm not sure.
什么  少来了  我很强悍的012---What? Come on, I am tough!
用拳打我这里  用全力012---Punch me right here, as hard as you can!
别激动  你为什么这么当真呢012---Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for?
那不重要  真的吗012--- It doesn't matter.  Really?
如果我说罗斯或钱德勒能打倒你呢012---What if I told you Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
我会说"姑娘  别闹了"012---I would say, "Woman, please."
厄休拉的未婚夫人真的很好012---Ursula's fiance is really sweet.
他是老师  他会做义工012---He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work.
通常我不喜欢爱流汗的男人012---Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
但我愿意帮他擦汗012---But I could just mop him up.
天啊  菲比  怎么了012--- Oh, my God, Phoebe?  What?
你在暗恋你姐姐的未婚夫012---You're getting a crush on your sister's fiance.
不  我才没有  是你012---No, I'm not, you are!
她的脾气上来了012---Here comes the temper.
不给糖就捣蛋012---Trick or treat.

乔伊一定会很兴奋012---Joey's gonna be thrilled.
他就希望你扮成风骚护士012---He was hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.
事实上我只是普通护士012---Actually, I'm just a nurse.
你以为我听了这话会觉得丢脸012---You'd think that would embarrass me,
但我已经丢够脸了012---but you see, I'm maxed out.
你来了  等一下012--- You made it.  Wait.
你是马铃薯  我是史波多012--- You're a potato?  Well, I'm a spud...?

这个问题有意思012---Okay. Here's a good one for you.
罗斯跟钱德勒打架谁会赢012---Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler?
我没办法回答  钱德勒是我老公012---I can't answer that. Chandler's my husband.
罗斯会赢  对012--- So Ross?  Yeah.
嘿  美女  你好  帅哥012--- Hey, beautiful.  Hello, handsome.
天啊012---Oh, God.

真的吗012---Oh, really?
我们都是老师012---We're both teachers.
我们都参加了和平工作团012---And we were both in the Peace Corps. 
真的吗012---Peace Corps, really?
我们在乌拉圭做义工时012---In fact, when we were building in Uruguay,
只相距两个小镇远  却从来没见过面012---we were two towns apart and we never met.
对  我刚到时那里一片荒芜012---Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there,
但我离开时那里已经是个小镇了012---but it was a town when I left.
我们去一醉方休吧  没问题012--- Shall we get me really drunk?  Sure.

什么问题012---What question?
莫妮卡跟我在讨论012---Monica and I were talking about
你跟罗斯打架谁会赢012---who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
那不成问题  你也觉得罗斯会赢012--- There's no question.  So you think Ross too?
你竟然选罗斯   罗斯真的很强壮012--- You picked Ross?  Ross is really strong.
他是你们三个之中最壮的  乔伊除外012---He's the strongest out of all three of you. Except for Joey.
我不敢相信你没有选我012---I can't believe you didn't pick me.
她说得对  我的确比你壮012---In her defense, she's right. I am stronger.
我能灭了你012---I would destroy you.

太谢谢你了012---Thank you so much for picking this up.
你真的是太棒了  真的吗012--- You are so sweet.  Really?
总有一天你会让某个男人012---Honey, someday you are gonna make some man

我得走了  不给糖就捣蛋012--- Got to go.  Trick or treat.
嗨  拿去吧012---Hi! Wow! There you go.
我朋友路易斯说你会给钱012---My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
没错  但现在我们有糖果了012---We were, but now we've got candy.
我更想要钱012---I'd rather have the money.
那由不得你来选  万圣节快乐012---That's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
这不公平012---This isn't fair.
你只要披上斗篷012---Is it fair that all you did was put on a cape
我就要白送你东西  那公平吗012---and I gotta give you free stuff?
闭嘴012---Shut up!
你才闭嘴012---You shut up!
你不能叫我闭嘴  我刚刚就说了啊012--- You can't tell me to shut up.  I think I just did.

我去拿支票簿012---Let me get my checkbook!
亲爱的  你不必这么做012---Look, honey. You don't have to do this, okay?
你强大的内心才是我最看重的012---It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
你既忠心又老实  而且还为人正直012---You're loyal, and you're honest and you have integrity.
这才是我希望在深爱的男人身上看到的品质012---That's the kind of strength I want in a man that I love.
那对我来说毫无意义  来吧012---That means nothing to me. Come on!
嗨  骗子012---Hi, liar.
他之所以会娶你012---You know, the only reason he's marrying you
是因为他以为你说的话都是真的012---is because he thinks the things you were saying were true.
有可能是真的  但你在说慌012--- They could be true.  But they're not.
真假只有一线之隔012---Yeah. It's a fine line.
你为什么要说谎  我不知道012--- Why are you lying to him?  I don't know.
他跟我说自己做过的事  我说我也做过012---He said he did all these stuff, I said I did it too.
他就变得很兴奋  我觉得很好玩012---and he got so excited, it was really fun.
亲爱的012---Honey?
这是个坏习惯  我要你马上戒烟012---It's a filthy, disgusting habit, and I want you to quit now!
她帮助很多人戒过烟012---She's helped so many people quit smoking.
我们得走了012---We'd really better get going.

我三番五次地离婚  搞大别人的肚子012---I keep getting divorces and knocking people up.
我还打扮得跟个粪团一样012---And I'm dressed as doodie.
你是史波多尼克012---You're Spudnik.
少来了  我骗谁呢  我就是粪团012---Come on, who we kidding ? I'm doodie.
