我觉得放在这里挺好012---I kind of like it here.
你真的喜欢吗012---Do you really like it?

太棒了  谢谢012---Great, thanks.
然后带她到四季饭店喝东西012---Then afterward you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks.
或是到城里听爵士乐012---Or go downtown and listen to some jazz.
或是跳舞  带她去跳舞吧012---Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!
你真的很会拖延性爱的进度012---You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex.
我怀念约会的感觉  可以盛装打扮012---I miss dating. Getting all dressed up
去高级餐厅吃饭012---and going to a fancy restaurant.
我很久都没法再出去约会了012---I won't be able to do that for so long.
那真的很有趣012---And it's so much fun.
其实坐在这里012---Not that sitting at home worrying about
担心生孩子的事也挺有意思012---giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
这样吧  我带你出去约会012---Hey, you know what? Why don't I take you out.
什么  你可不想跟孕妇约会012---What? Joey, you don't want to date a pregnant lady.
我愿意  我们就出去好好享受一番012---Yes, I do. We're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time.
我会让你忘了生孩子  剖腹产012---I'll take your mind off of childbirth, and Csections...

好吧  轮到我了012---Okay, I'm next.
别再开始新一盘了  轮到我了  菲比012---Don't start another game. I'm next! Phoebe?
抱歉  我赢得太开心  听不到你说话012---Sorry, I couldn't hear you over all the winning.
菲比在霸占游戏机012---Chandler, Phoebe's hogging the game.
至于吗  不过是个愚蠢的游戏012---Who cares? It's a stupid game.
你觉得它蠢是因为你玩得太逊012---You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
我不逊  是游戏太逊012---I don't suck. It sucks.
你才逊012---You suck.
如果这个游戏012---Wait okay, if this game
会惹得你们俩闹别扭012---is gonna cause problems between the two of you,
那我还是自己留着玩吧012---then maybe I should just keep it.
不  我喜欢它  这个礼物棒极了012---No, I love it. It is a great present.
你为什么不回家等我给你寄感谢贺卡呢012---In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thankyou card?
你为什么这么想玩这个游戏012---Why do you want to play this game so badly?
是啊  又不是每玩完一盘就往外吐糖果012---Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
好吧  菲比  够了  快起来012---Okay. Phoebe, that's it. Come on, out of the chair.
快点  快点  起来012---Come on. Come on, out of the chair.
菲比012---Phoebe!
乔伊  麻烦你去开门012---Joey, could you get that?
乔伊012---Joey.
你怎么在这儿012---What are you doing here?
我以为你在房里012---I thought you were in your room.
我是来接你去约会的012---No, I'm picking you up for our date.
这是送你的012---These are for you.
百合花  这是我最喜欢的花  谢谢012---Lilies. They're my favorite. Thank you.
还有巧克力布朗尼012---And a brownie.
只剩一半了012---Well, half a brownie.
其实只剩袋子了012---Actually, it's just a bag.
从花店走回来真的很远012---It's a long walk from the flower shop
我饿得头晕  所以...012---and I felt faint, so...
这简直太棒了  我觉得好像真的在约会012---This is so great! I actually feel like I'm on a real date.
不过我有种要晨吐的感觉012---Although, I have a hint of morning sickness,
而且我穿的内裤裤腰高到012---and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about...
这里012---...there.

桌上足球  披萨盒012---Foosball. Pizza box.
还有花花公子杂志  你是我喜欢的那种女人012---Oh, a subscription to Playboy. My kind of woman.
那是我室友的杂志012---That's my roommate's.
我想见见他  他似乎是个好男人012---I'd like to meet him. He sounds like a standup guy.
但他对我的保护欲很强  你最好小心一点012---But he's protective of me, so you'd better watch yourself.
你室友很帅吗012---So this roommate of yours, is he goodlooking?
你一定要很努力才能控制自己不爱上他012---Must be tough to keep your hands off him.
我很确定他是男同志012---I'm pretty sure he's gay.
他才不是呢  你为什么要破坏这个游戏012---No! No, he's not! Why are you trying to ruin the game?
别这样嘛012---Come on.
这就又回到了葛瑞利的骨牌理论012---Which brings us back, of course, to Greely's Theory of Dominance.
今天的课就到这里012---That's it for today.
有人知道费利曼楼在哪里吗012---Does anyone know where the Freeman Building is?
那是A大道的新大楼012---Yeah. It's the new building on Avenue A.
什么  那在城里的另一边012---Waht? That's all the way across town.
我十分钟内得赶到那里给研究生上课012---I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
那是不可能的012---Dude, that's not gonna happen.
快闪开012---Move it! Move it! Move it!
我是老师012---Hey! I'm the teacher!
大家好012---Hello.
抱歉我迟到了  严重迟到了012---Sorry I'm a little late. Whoa, a lot late.
我从自我介绍开始吧012---Well, let me start by introducing myself.
我是盖勒教授012---I'm Professor Geller.

我是盖勒教授  今天大家表现很好012---...I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.
菲力牛排搭配什么012---Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
配菜是蒸蔬菜012---There's a side of steamed vegetables.
除了蔬菜...012---Instead of the vegetables...
我可以用什么菜品搭配012---...is there any way that I could substitute the...
三磅龙虾行吗012---...threepound lobster?
帮她把两道菜都送上来012---You know what? Bring her both.
我跟她点一样的东西012---And I'll have the same.
感觉这次约会很成功012---Wow, this is shaping up to be a pretty good date.
我差点忘了  我没付你房租012---I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.
别当我们是室友  我们在约会012---No roommate stuff, okay? We're on a date.
我就要知道乔伊·崔比安尼是怎么跟人约会的了012---Okay. Wow, so I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.
你有什么招数吗012---Do you have any moves?
不  我只会做我自己012---No, I'm just myself,
如果她们不喜欢我012---and if they don't like me for...
抱歉  这种话我实在说不下去012---I'm sorry, I couldn't even get through that.
我就知道  告诉我你有什么招数012---I knew it. I knew it. Come, tell me your moves.
好吧012---All right.
约会一开始  我会假装有影迷012---I usually start by having a bottle of wine
送红酒给我012---sent to my table from a fan.
天啊  这招管用吗012---Oh, my God. And that works?
你得加上一句"真是太不好意思了012---Well, it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing,
我只想过正常人的生活"012---I just want to have a normal life!"
你们这些可怜的名人012---You poor little famous man.
好吧  听听这招012---Okay, how about this one?
我本来想等到送你回家再吻你...012---I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you...
但你真的太美了  我实在难以自持012---...but you're just so beautiful, I don't think I can.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
这招太绝了  我差点就凑上去了  真的012---Wow, that was fantastic! I almost leaned in. I really almost did.
告诉我你用的是什么招数012---All right. So tell me one of your moves.
好吧012---All right.
你是在哪里长大的012---So where'd you grow up?
那就是你的招数012---That's your move?
瑞秋  还好你长得很美012---Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
快回答我的问题  皇后区012--- Come on, just answer the question.  Queens.
你跟父母亲近吗012---So were you close to your parents?
我跟妈妈亲  跟爸爸不太说话012---With my mom. Not so much my dad.
为什么012---Why not?
我不知道  感觉我们之间有种隔阂012---I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance.
我们都假装没有  但事实上不然012---I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
那一定很辛苦012---It's gotta be rough.
对  真的很辛苦  有时候我觉得...012---Yeah, it's really tough. Sometimes I think...
太帅了012---Nice move!
"你在哪里长大的 "  这招好简单啊012---"Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
谢谢012---Thank you.
对不起  我要去洗手间012---Now, excuse me. I'm gonna use the restroom.
你在注视我离开的背影012---Now you're watching me walk away.
没错  太简单了012---Yes, I am! Again, so simple!
你一定不相信今天我做了什么012---You are not gonna believe what I did today.
很明显  你没洗澡  也没刮胡子012---It clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
我玩了一整天这个游戏  现在我是第一名012---I got good. I played this game all day, and now I rule at it.
他们应该把它改名为"钱德勒小姐"012---They should change the name to "Ms. Chandler."
还是不要好了012---Although, I hope they don't.
你待在家里玩了一整天"吃豆小姐"012---Wait a minute. You stayed home and played Ms. PacMan
而我在外面像牛一样工作012---while I went to work like a chump?
我包办了前十名  把菲比挤下了排行榜012---I got all the top 10 scores. I erased Phoebe off the board.
击掌庆祝一下吧012---Highfive!
你的手是怎么了012---What is the matter with your hand?
我打了八小时的电动012---I've been playing it for like eight hours,
会放松下来的  看看我的比分记录012---It'll loosen up. Come on. Check out the scores.
再看看我编的名字  全是脏话012---Also, look at the initials. They're dirty words.
钱德勒  你为什么要那么做012---Chandler, why would you do that?
因为这样很帅气012---Because it's awesome.
你觉得那么做很聪明吗012---You think it's clever?
我只能写下三个字母012---They only give you three letters,
除了ASS（屁股）外  其它名字很难想012---so after ASS, it is a challenge.
这不是脏话012---This one's not dirty.
把它跟那个连在一起就是了012---It is when you put it together with that one.
如果你不办法把它清掉012---If you don't clear this off,
以后就别想从我这里尝到那种甜头012---you won't get one of those from me.
本明天会过来玩游戏  不能让他看到这个012---Ben's coming over tomorrow to play this game. This can't be there.
他都不知道这些词是什么意思012---Come on. He won't know what they mean.
钱德勒  他都七岁了  他又不笨012---Chandler, he's 7, he's not stupid.
最近你跟他谈过吗012---Have you talked to him lately?
我要把插头拔掉012---I'm gonna unplug it.
别啊  拔掉之后  我今天就等于一无所获012---Nonono, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day!
那和上班又有什么区别012---It would be like I was at work.
不012---No!
你看  记录还在012---Hey, look! It's still there!
这玩意一定是用的原始记忆晶片012---This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM chip or something!
你得打败自己的成绩012---Honey, you gotta beat your scores.
我的手指都张不开了012---With the claw?
好吧  让我来  我得把这些词消掉012---Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen.
卡罗尔还在气你教他"拉我的手指"012---Carol's still upset that you taught him "Pull my finger." 
拉我的手指  我的手都毁了012---Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!
我不会回答那个问题012---I am not gonna answer that.
来吧  快挑一个012---Oh, come on. Just pick one.
在莫妮卡  菲比  钱德勒跟罗斯之间...012---Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Ross...
如果你迫不得已012---...if you had to, if you had to,
你会打谁012---who would you punch?
我们是朋友  我不会打他们012---No one! We're friends. I wouldn't punch any of them.
钱德勒吗012---Chandler?
对  但我不知道为什么012---Yeah, but I don't know why.
我玩得很开心  我也是012--- I'm having such a wonderful time!  Me too!
这是我最棒的约会经验  我知道012--- Rach, can I just say this is the best date I ever had.  I know!
我笑得好厉害012---I've never laughed so hard.
你看到酒从我鼻子喷出来吗012---Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
乔伊  我想大家都看到了012---Joey, I think everybody saw the wine come out of your nose.
我从不知道自己会这么喜欢012---I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy
没有性爱的约会012---the nonsex part of a date so much.
那是因为你没有跟我约会过012---That's because you have never been on a date with me before.
好吧  别瞧不起我012---All right. Now don't judge me.
通常我会等我的对象离开了再这么做012---I normally wait till my date leaves,
但你住在这里  我要吃带回来的剩饭了012---but but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
好吧  你也别瞧不起我012---Okay, then you don't judge me.
我要去舔之前那个蛋糕的包装纸012---I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from that brownie I had before.
对012---Oh, yeah.
告诉我012---So tell me,
乔伊·崔比安尼说晚安的招数是什么012---what are Joey Tribbiani's endofthenight moves?
如果我想让那个女孩吻我...012---Well, if I want the girl to kiss me...
首先我会让我的嘴巴看起来难以抵抗012---...first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
你都是怎么做的012---How do you do that?
你不能告诉任何人  但是012---Now you can't tell anyone, but...
我会涂上护唇膏012---...I put on shiny lip balm.
天啊  女人就跟飞蛾扑火一样012--- Oh, my God.  Like a moth to a flame, I'm telling you.
好吧  轮到你了012---Okay, all right, so, now you go.
不  我不想告诉你012---No, I don't want to tell you.
为什么  那太丢脸了012--- Why not?  Because it's embarrassing.
比涂黑莓口味的护唇膏还丢脸012---More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?
我刚刚没说黑莓口味吧012---I didn't say raspberry before, did I?
快告诉我  瑞秋012---Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
好吧012---Okay.
站起来012---All right, stand up.
我们走到门口时...012---Well, when we're at the door...
我会将我的嘴唇轻轻压在他的嘴唇上012---...I lightly press my lips against his.
将身体靠向他  停留一秒钟012---Then move into his body, just for a second.
然后我会发出这样的声音012---And then I make this sound:
听起来没什么  但很有效012---It doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
对  的确有效012---Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.
好吧  我得睡了 我今晚玩得很开心012---All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey. I had such a wonderful time.
我也是012---Me too.
你上课迟到了50分钟  你是用爬的吗012---You were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?
不  我用跑的  真的很远012---No, I ran, okay? It's really far.
现在的人怎么都听不懂012---When did people stop understanding
"别挡我的路"呢012---the phrase "Get the hell out of my way"?
你为什么不搭计程车012---Why didn't you take a cab?
塞车太严重  还净是单行道012---Between the traffic that time of day and all the oneway streets
搭计程车得花两倍的时间012---it'd take me twice as long.
再说  我一星期有三堂课012---Besides, I teach the class three times a week.
你以为我是富家子弟吗012---Who am I, Rockefeller?
你不能再继续这样下去了012---You won't be able to keep doing this.
没办法  不然他们会取消我这堂课012---I have to. If I don't, they'll take the class away from me.
我已经把这条新闻登在我家的通讯报上了012---And I put it in my family newsletter.
什么  你看过的  《盖勒通讯报》012--- Your what?  You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.
对012---Right. Wow.
我想出一条比较快的路线012---I think I figured out a much faster route.
我敢说这次我能及时赶到012---I'm sure I can make it this time.
只是我不能害怕被车子撞到012---I just can't be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars.
还记得昨晚我们谈过《狂犬惊魂记》吗012---Remember last night when we talked about Cujo?
我不敢相信你没看过《狂犬惊魂记》012---Yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.
真搞不懂你012---What is wrong with you?
至于吗  那又不是《公民凯恩》012---Relax, it's not like it's Citizen Kane.
你看完了《公民凯恩》012---Have you ever sat through Citizen Kane?
是啊  真的很无聊  但那可是经典012---Yeah, it's really boring. But it's, like, a big deal.
总之  我想去租《狂犬惊魂记》012---Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
我们今晚一起看吧012---Yeah, all right. Well, let's do it tonight.
你不是有约会吗  对012--- Don't you have that big date tonight?  Oh, right.
乔伊  我能问你一件事吗  问吧012--- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?  Yeah.
昨晚约会后  你有没有觉得怪怪的012---After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
天啊  你也是吗012---Oh, my God. You did too?
我吓坏了  那是怎么回事012---It totally freaked me out. What was that?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我觉得应该是龙虾的问题012---I'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.
对啊  龙虾012---Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.
我吐了一整晚  我也是012--- I was up sick all night.  Me too. All night.
真的吗  那我怎么没看到你012---Really? How come we didn't cross paths?
对  那是因为012---Yeah, well, that's because...
我都待在房里012---...I stayed in my room.
我的洗衣篮惨不忍睹012---You don't want to look in my hamper.
好了  吃掉那个012---Okay, I got that.
躲过那里  然后再回来012---I'll escape there. I'll come back here.
好了  加油  吃豆小姐012---All right. Come on, Ms. PacMan.
你就是个小贱人  对吧012---Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?!
大家好012---Hey, you guys?
抱歉之前我霸占着电动玩具012---I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
你朋友名字的缩写真难听012---Your friends have some unfortunate initials.
那都是钱德勒干的012---They're all Chandler.
钱德勒不可能有这么厉害012---Chandler sucks. He couldn't get this good.
我很厉害  但那是要付出代价的012---I did. But it came at a price.
本今晚要过来  不能让他看到这些012---Ben's coming over tonight, and he can't see this.
七岁的孩子应该连杂交都看过了吧012---Come on. By age 7, kids have already seen orgies.
还是只有我而己012---Was it just me?
我办到了  我及时赶到了012---Yes, I made it! I'm on time!
好了  请大家012---Okay, why don't we all...
翻到第23页...012---...open our books to page 23...
