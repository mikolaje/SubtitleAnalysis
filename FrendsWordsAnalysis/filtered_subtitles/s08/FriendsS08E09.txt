瑞秋  你知道怀孕的时候...012---Rach, listen. Did you know that during pregnancy...
你的手指会肿成两倍粗012---...your fingers swell up to twice their size
而且再也不会消了吗012---and never go back?
天啊  让我看看012---Oh, my God! Let me see that.
你每次都会上当012---You fall for it every time.
我把我的旧孕妇装拿来给你012---Hey! I brought you my old maternity clothes.
菲比  你真是太贴心了012---Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
好可爱哦  是啊012--- Oh, those are so cute!  Yes.
你看  宝宝越长越大 它们也会跟着撑开来012---Look. See how they expand as the baby grows?
宝宝出生后012---And then after the baby's born
可以穿它去偷西瓜012---they're great for shoplifting melons.
太好了  你们都在  感恩节  明天四点012---Good, you're all here. Okay. Thanksgiving, tomorrow, 4:00.
你猜我邀请了谁012---Guess who I invited?
还记得高中同学威尔·卡佛特吗012---Remember Will Culvert from high school?
不记得了  他跟罗斯同班012--- No.  He was in Ross' class.
他是军乐队的  有点胖012---Marching band, was kind of overweight.
他是个大胖子012---Really overweight.
我属于他的苗条朋友012---I was his thin friend.
我不记得他了012---I don't remember him.
你确定你说的不是你假想的男朋友吗012---Are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend?
不  那是贾拉德012---No, that was Jared.
我好久没有想起他了012---Haven't thought about him in a long time.
威尔来城里出差012---Anyway, Will's here on business,
他没地方可去  所以我邀请他过来012---and he didn't have a place to go, so I invited him here.
那很好啊  他减肥成功了012--- That's nice.  Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.
他看起来很不错  他真的是帅呆了012---He looks good. Okay, I mean really gorgeous.
我还爱着钱德勒012---I still love Chandler.
偶尔提一次不会要你的命012---Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.
先说好了  今年我不烤火鸡012---Just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year...
什么  菲比不吃火鸡012--- What?  Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.
菲比  火鸡是漂亮聪明的动物012--- Phoebe!  Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals.
不是的  它们既丑又蠢  但很好吃012---No, they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
不只是菲比  威尔还在节食012---It's not just Phoebe.Will's still on a diet,
钱德勒不吃感恩节食物...012---Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food...
瑞秋对家禽类反胃  是吗012--- Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.  She is?
对  记得吗  那天你吃烤鸡时012---Yeah. Remember? I had to leave the other day
我不得不走开012---when you had that roast chicken.
我还以为是因为我把烧鸡套在手上012---Yeah. I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand
让它在桌子上走路012---and made it walk across the table.
为了三个人做一只火鸡太不划算了012---It's not worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people.
那真的很费功夫012---It's a lot of work.
但感恩节一定要吃火鸡啊012---But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
感恩节不吃火鸡012---I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like
就像国庆日不吃苹果派012---Fourth of July with no apple pie.
或是星期五不吃两个披萨012---Or Friday with no two pizzas.
如果真的对你那么重要的话我就做012---Fine, if it means that much to you.
但到时候一定会剩下很多012---But there's gonna be a ton left over.
不  我发誓我会把整只火鸡吃完012---No, there won't. I promise I will finish that turkey.
你是说你可以一次吃掉012---You're telling me you can eat almost
一整只火鸡012---an entire turkey in one sitting?
没错  因为我是崔比亚尼家的人012---That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!
这是我们的专长012---This is what we do.
我们不是伟大的思想家或世界领袖...012---We may not be great thinkers or world leaders...
我们书念得不多  跑得不快012---...we don't read a lot or run fast,
但我们绝对是大胃王012---but damn it, we can eat!
《老友记》  第八季  第9集  谣言012---Friends S08E09 The One With The Rumor
第四次长传  第三次18码012---Four wide receivers. On third and 18.
明年桌边会坐一个宝宝012---Isn't it weird to think about how next year there this time
感觉很奇怪吧012---there will be a baby at the table?
我是指瑞秋的孩子012---Rachel's.
但我很高兴知道你的真实想法012---But good to know where you're at.
感恩节快乐  你也是012--- Happy Thanksgiving.  You too!
需要我帮忙吗  好啊012--- Anything I can do to help?  Actually there is.
通常钱德勒会帮忙 但他看球赛看得正入迷012---Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game
我不想打扰他012---so I don't want to bother him.
麻烦你帮忙折餐巾吧  没问题012--- Could you help me to fold these napkins?  Sure.
我要去对面看看地瓜泥好了没  好012--- I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.  Okay.
不  亲爱的  不是那样折012---No, sweetie. No, not like that.
我们不是在办农场舞会012---We're not at a barn dance.
要把它们折成天鹅的形状012---You've gotta fold them like swans.
我在圣诞节时教过你  记得吗012---Like I showed you at Christmas. Remember?
记得  一切历历在目012---Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.
球赛好看吗  我不知道012--- So how's the game?  I have no idea.
什么  我假装看球赛012--- What?  Yeah, I'm just pretending to watch the game
那样子就不必帮忙012---...so I don't have to help out with stuff.
我不敢相信012---I don't believe you!
这招太高明了012---That is brilliant!
莫妮卡没发觉吗  对012--- And Monica has no idea?  No.
偶尔我会对着电视大叫012---Every once and a while, I just scream stuff at the TV.
怎么回事012---Hey! What? Aw! Hey!
你的球队赢了吗  安德森刚刚又得分了012--- Your team winning, hon?  Yeah. Anderson just scored again.
根本就没有安德森这号人物012---There is no Anderson.
我也想如法炮制  莫妮卡012---I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?
看来我没办法帮你了012---I don't think I can help you after all.
我不知道今天会播这场球赛012---I didn't realize this game was on.
没听说你喜欢橄榄球  我平时不喜欢012--- I don't know you like football.  Normally, I don't.
但今天是绿湾队在比赛012---But, you know, Green Bay is playing.
你喜欢绿湾队  那是我最喜欢的海湾012--- You like Green Bay?  It's only my favorite bay.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving.
谢谢  威尔  我很高兴你能来012---Thanks. Will, I'm so glad that you came.
你看起来帅呆了  你一定减掉了012---You look great. You must've lost like...
150磅012---150 pounds.
我会是赛百味三明治广告的下一号人选012---I'll be on one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
是派  零脂肪  无糖  也没有奶012--- A pie!  It's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy.
一点都不好吃  丢了吧012---It's no good. Throw it out.
我来介绍你们认识012---You wanna meet some people.
这是我丈夫钱德勒  这是威尔012---This is my husband, Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
我很想跟你握手  但我忙着看球赛012---Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand but I'm really into the game.
而且如果我们两个不站在一起012---Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego
我的自尊就不会那么受伤012---if we didn't stand right next to each other.
这是菲比012---This is Phoebe.
干得好012---Well done.
你要帮我吗  好012--- Wanna give me a hand?  Sure.
莫妮卡  我真的觉得你很漂亮012---Monica, I can't get over how great you look. You look stunning.
你也很帅  你身材真棒012---You look incredible too. You're so fit.
虽说我在看球赛  但我没聋012---I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.
我一直想告诉你  罗斯也会来012---I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
太棒了  我喜欢罗斯012---Ross is coming. Great, I love Ross.
很好  瑞秋·格林也会来012---Good. And Rachel Greene too.
有问题吗  没有  没关系的012--- Is there a problem?  No. It's okay.
只是...天啊  我恨她012---It's just... God, I hated her.
什么  我恨她012--- What?  Yeah. I hated her.
高中时她对我很差劲012---She was horrible to me in high school.
但那是很久以前的事了012---But hey, that was a long time ago.
我现在一切都好  或许再见到她会很有趣012---I'm in a good place. Might be fun to see her again.
你有蛋糕或饼干什么的吗012---Got any cakes or cookies or something?
不行  威尔  不行012---No, Will! No!
我们很久没大叫了  或许我们该叫一下012---It's been a while since we screamed. Maybe we should.
好吧  不要啊  加油012--- Oh, okay. No!  Come on!
该死的裁判  下地狱去吧012---Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!
你这是要干嘛012---What are you doing?
你还得吃掉一整只火鸡012---You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.
让我跟你解释一下人体的运作原理012---Let me explain to you how the human body works.
我得先让我的胃暖暖身012---I have to warm up my stomach first.
吃薯片像是在做拉筋运动  好吧012--- Eating chips is like stretching.  Okay.
别担心  崔比亚尼永远吃不饱012---Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
我知道你的意思012---I actually know what you're talking about.
我要告诉你一件事012---I'm here to tell you something, friend.
你可以吃个不停  但你无法填满内心的空虚012---You can eat and eat, but nothing will ever fill that void.
这家伙到底是谁012---Who the hell is this guy?
他是我们的高中同学威尔  他是乔伊012---This is Will, from high school. This is Joey.
威尔  罗斯012--- Will!  Ross!
你来了012---Hey, you came!
天啊  你看起来棒极了  大帅哥012---Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff!
大帅哥  很高兴能见到你012--- Hot stuff ?  It's good to see you, man.
我也是  你是做哪一行的012---Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?
我是期货经纪人  听起来很有趣012--- I'm a commodities broker.  Really? That sounds interesting.
才怪012---Yeah, it's not.
但我现在既有钱  身材又好012---But I'm rich and thin.
自从兰西戴维斯的毕业派对之后我就没有见过你012---I haven't seen you since Lance Davis' graduation party.
那一晚真的很疯狂012---That was such a fun night.
如果我们都有被邀请就好了 但还是很疯狂012---Would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
那时我们逊毙了012---We were lame back then.
你还记得我们当时多迷恐龙吗012---Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
对  你是做哪一行的012--- Yeah.  So, what do you do now?
你要在城里待多久012---So how long are you in town?
亲爱的  太好了012---Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.
瑞秋·格林012---Rachel Greene.
对了  你没事吧012---Oh, that's right. Are you gonna be okay?
我没事  只是...012---Oh, I'll be fine. It's just...
天啊  罗斯  我恨她012---God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!
高中是很久以前的事了012---Will, high school was a long time ago.
看看她拿着地瓜泥站在那里的样子012---Look at her standing there with those yams.
我的两个死对头012---My two greatest enemies, Ross:
瑞秋·格林跟碳水化合物012---Rachel Greene and complex carbohydrates.
天啊  莫妮卡  那是谁012---Oh, my God. Monica, who is that?
他是我们的高中同学威尔012---That's Will, from high school.
我不记得他了012---Oh! I do not remember him.
他真的越来越性感了012---Wow, really got that sexy smoldering thing going on.
天啊  看他盯着我瞧的样子012---Oh, my God. Look at the way he's just staring at me.
他好像想用唇语跟我说话  但看不出说的什么012---He's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.
我恨你012---I hate you!
好了  晚餐准备好了  好吧012--- Okay, dinner's ready!  Okay!
真的很精彩  谁赢了012--- Solid effort. Solid effort.  Oh, so who won?
绿湾队  底特律队012--- Green Bay.  Detroit.
什么  技术上来说狮队赢了012--- What?  The Lions technically won.
但在士气方面是绿湾美人鱼队赢了012---But it was a moral victory for the Green Bay Mermen.
你是威尔吧  对012--- Hi! Will, right?  Right.
我是瑞秋·格林012---Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.
我记得你  真的吗  你真好012--- Oh, I remember you.  Really? aren't you sweet?
我得告诉你  我真的很难记得你的样子012---I gotta tell you though, I'm having the hardest time placing you.
等一下  我想我记得你012---Hang on! I think I remember you.
我们...012---Did we...
我们在兰西戴维斯的毕业派对上鬼混过吗012---Did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?
你真是不可思议  谢谢你012--- You are unbelievable.  Thank you.
瑞秋  你坐这边  威尔  你坐到那边去012---Rachel? Why don't you sit here? And Will, you sit way over there.
就那样012---That's it?
即使没有人帮我  我也可以吃掉它012---Even if nobody helps me, I can eat that.
没问题  至少给我一点挑战012---No problem. At least give me a challenge.
这是钱德勒的鸡肉012---This is Chandler's chicken.
这才是火鸡012---This is the turkey.
这有多大012---How big is that?
大约19磅012---About 19 pounds.
它跟我刚出生时差不多大012---It's like me when I was born.
谁想吃地瓜泥  威尔012---Alright. Who would like some yams? Will?
你喜欢那样做  对吧012---You'd like that, wouldn't you?
什么  拜托把鸡肉...012---What? Oh, you know what, can we please keep the chicken...
跟火鸡放到另一边去012---...and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?
那个味道真的恶心  太典型了012--- The smell is just...  Typical.
什么  我说那太典型了012--- I'm sorry. What?  I said it was typical.
瑞秋·格林的典型作风012---Typical of you. Rachel Green.
瑞秋女王在瑞秋王国想做什么就做什么012---Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in Rachelland.
说真的  这家伙是谁012---Seriously, who is this guy?
抱歉  你对我有意见吗012---Sorry, do you have a problem with me?
我不知道  我有吗012---I don't know. Do I? Do I?
我想你有012---I think you do.
你在高中时对他有点恶劣012---Apparently, You were a little mean to him in high school.
有点恶劣  你让我活在痛苦深渊012---A little mean? You made my life miserable.
我不知道  抱歉012---I had no idea. I'm sorry.
你应该抱歉  去他的012---Well, you should be. Screw it.
把地瓜泥拿过来给我012---Bring on the yams.
威尔  但你很努力在减肥012---Will, but you worked so hard.
地瓜泥  好的012--- Yams!  Okay.
不论在高中时  我对你做了什么012---Will, I just want to say that I'm real sorry
我都非常抱歉012---for whatever I did to you in high school.
不只是我  我们组了一个社团012---It wasn't just me. We had a club.
你们组了一个社团012---You had a club?
没错  "我恨瑞秋·格林社"012---That's right. The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!
天啊  你们全都聚在一起恨我吗012---My god. So you all just joined together to hate me?
还有谁加入了那个社团  我跟罗斯012--- Who else was in this club?  Me and Ross.
你不必指我  她知道罗斯是谁012---No need to point. She knows who Ross is.
你加入了"我恨瑞秋社"  没错012--- You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?  Yes, he was.
不要012---No, no.
还有谁参加了你们的社团012---So who else was in this club?
那个来自泰国的交换学生012---Actually, there was also that exchange student from Thailand
但我想他不知道那是怎么一回事012---but I don't think he knew what it was.
罗斯  我们交往了两年...012---So, Ross, we went out for two years...
你没有告诉我你参加过"我恨瑞秋社"012---...and you never told me you were in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?
你跟她交往过  我们说好的012---You went out with her? We had a pact.
那是高中的事了  又不是永久的约定012---It was in high school. It's not like it was binding forever.
那为什么里面有"永远"这个字眼012---Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
莫妮卡  你知道这件事吗012---Monica? Did you know about this?
我发誓不知道012---I swear I didn't.
所以你们才会常把房门锁上吗012---Is that why you used to lock the bedroom door?
对  我得说我松了一口气012--- Yeah.  A little relieved, I gotta say.
听着  瑞秋  我很抱歉  好吗012---Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
那时我是个愚蠢的孩子012---I was a stupid kid, okay?
我会加入社团是因为...  是一起成立012--- The only reason I joined...  Cofounded.
一起成立012---Cofounded.
我一起成立那个社团是因为我那时疯狂地爱着你012---Cofounded the club, was that I was insanely in love with you.
显然我处理得不够好012---Obviously I didn't handle it very well.
但如果你仔细想想012---If you think about it,
"我恨瑞秋社"其实是"我爱瑞秋社"012---the "I Hate Rachel Club" was really the "I Love Rachel Club."
但它真的是"我恨瑞秋社"012---Except that it was really the "I Hate Rachel Club."
难道你们就聚到一起说我的坏话吗012---Okay. So you'd get together and like just say mean things about me?
不只是那样  没有没有012--- We did a little more than that.  No, no, no.
你们还做了什么012---What else did you do?
我们散布一个谣言  什么谣言012--- We started a rumor.  What rumor?
快点  威尔  脱掉上衣  告诉我们012---Come on, Will, just take off your shirt and tell us.
罗斯  那真的没什么012--- Ross?  It was no big deal.
我们说...012---We said that...
那个谣言是...012---The rumor was that...
你同时有男性跟女性的生殖器官012---...you had both male and female reproductive parts.
什么  没错  我们说你爸妈012--- What?  That's right. We said your parents...
丢铜板决定把你当成女孩养大012---...flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl,
但你还是有小鸡鸡012---but you still had a hint of a penis.
天啊  那是你们编的012--- Oh, my God!  You started that?
你也听过  我们学校里每个人都听过012--- What? You heard that?  Everyone at our school heard it!
我的学校里每个人都听过012---Everyone at my school heard it.
你就是那个长岛的双性啦啦队员012---You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?
不012---Oh, no!
现在我终于懂了012---Oh my God! This is all making so much sense to me now!
所以亚当·卡特不想跟我约会012---This is why Adam Can'ter wouldn't go out with me.
为什么比利·特雷特只想对这块区域下手012---This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
比利·特雷特成了男同志012---Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now,
所以那不是我们的错012---so that one's not really our fault.
莫妮卡  你为什么不告诉我012---Monica, how come you never told me this?
我想或许那是真的012---I thought it might be true.
我担心你会大哭把它掏出来给我看012---I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
乔伊别看了  那里面没有东西012---Joey, stop staring! There's nothing there!
那不是真的012---It's not true!
恐怕我需要证据012---I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
你是我的珠穆朗玛峰012---You are my Everest.
你不必吃完它012---Joey, you don't have to finish that.
我必须吃完  不然接下来会怎样012---Yes, I do. Otherwise, what's next?
今天我吃不完一只火鸡012---Today I’m just a guy who can't finish a turkey,
明天我只能吃一半的三明治012---but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar,
把剩下的部分包起来放在冰箱  不行012---...wrap it up and put it in the fridge? No!
我得去换条裤子012---I just... I just gotta change my pants.
我在想什么  牛仔裤根本没有伸缩性012---What was I thinking? Jeans have no give.
好了012---Okay, okay.
你们看史恩·麦马洪在我的纪念册上写了什么012---Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year.
"亲爱的瑞秋  你真是个好人"012---"Dear Rach, you're such a great person."
不是女孩  是"人"012---Not girl, "person."
瑞秋  我觉得你太敏感了012---Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
"亲爱的瑞秋  你是个好人012---"Dear Rach. You're a great person.
关于你有小鸡鸡的事我很遗憾"012---Sorry about your teeny weenie."
你要我怎么做012---What do you want me to do...
你要我打电话给全校的人012---I want me to call everyone in the entire school
告诉他们那不是真的012---and tell them it wasn't true?
对  可以顺便告诉他们我变瘦了吗012--- Yes.  Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
还有我012---Oh! Me too!
我不会打电话给任何人012---Look, I won't call anybody.
那是很久以前的事了012---It was a million years ago.
我不在乎那是多久之前的事了012---I don't care how long ago it was.
你们告诉大家我是双性人012---You told people that I was half and half!
我要说明一点012---You know what? I just want to point out
在高中  我没做过任何伤害你的事012---I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
那不完全是真的012---That's not totally true.
什么  什么012--- What?  What?
你告诉大家罗斯012---You did start that rumor about Ross...
跟50岁大的图书馆员亚特曼太太亲热012---...making out with Mrs. Altmann, our 50yearold librarian.
你怎么知道那件事012---How did you know that?
那是真的  不是012--- It's true?  No.
是真的  我看到你们躲在书卡柜的后面012---Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog.
亚特曼太太012---Mrs. Altmann?
她在塔塔卡奇奇回泰国前一晚012---She also made out with TaTakaKiKek
