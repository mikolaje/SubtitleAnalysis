等一下  在进屋之前我要你知道012---Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know that
我爱你012---I love you.
我蜜月时玩得很高兴012---I had a great time on our honeymoon.
我等不及要跟你共度一生了012---I can't wait to spend the rest of our life together.
你还戴着那条贝壳项链012---You're sticking with the shell necklace, huh?
你们回来了012---You're back!
快进来012---Come on in!
你们蜜月玩得开心吗012---How was the honeymoon?
我们很开心  最棒的是012---So much fun. But the best part is,
我们认识了一对很棒的夫妇012---we met this great couple on the flight back.
那是最棒的吗012---That was the best part?
蜜月过得不错啊  小子012---Good honeymooning, tiger.
他们很酷  他们也是去度蜜月的012---They're really cool. They were on their honeymoon too.
他们人超好  就住在城里012---They're terrific.They live here in the city.
我们能打电话给他们吗  现在打会不会太快了012---Can we go call them? Is it too soon to call?
我想打给他们012---I wanna call.
抱歉  我们很兴奋012---I'm sorry. We're just kind of excited.
我们终于认识一对夫妇朋友了012---We finally have a couple to hang out with.
夫妇朋友  你是指两个人吗012---A couple? Like two people?
像是一  二  两个人吗012---Like one, two people?
那不一样  葛瑞格跟珍妮结婚了012---This is different. Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
葛瑞格跟珍妮012---Greg and Jenny?
"葛瑞格  我是钱德勒  这是莫妮卡"012---"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler. This is Monica"
"嗨  莫妮卡  她是珍妮"012---"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"嗨  珍妮  嗨  葛瑞格"012---"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."
他们真的很棒  如果你们  你知道吗012--- They're great. If you just got a chance...  You know what?
快送我们纪念品  然后滚出去012---Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get out of here.
我们没来得及...  你开玩笑吧012--- We didn't get a chance to...  You've gotta to be kidding me!
我们没给任何人买礼物012---We didn't get anything for anyone.
好漂亮的项链012---Yeah. Nice necklace.
这个可以送给你012---That you can have.
《老友记》  第八季  第4集  录像带012---Friends S08E04 The One With The Videotape
你们好呀012---Hello.
欢迎你们回来  蜜月玩得可好012--- Welcome home.  How was the honeymoon?
太棒了  你们呢  你们要有宝宝了012---Great! How about you? You're having a baby!
你看  我有宝宝的B超  太棒了012--- Look, I have a sonogram picture.  Good.
罗斯  宝宝遗传了你的黑色卷发012---Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.
现在罗斯知道了  到底是怎么发生的012---Now that Ross knows, can you tell us how'd it happen?
在什么时候  你们做了几次012---When did it happen? How many times does it happen?
莫妮卡  那么问是不对的012---Monica, that's not right.
从你们在哪里做开始说吧012---Start with where.
事情发生在六个星期前012---It happened about six weeks ago.
我回到家  发现罗斯也在012---I just got home from work and Ross was already there.
他跟乔伊在一起玩012---Guess he'd been hanging out with Joey.
别客气  兄弟012---You're welcome, buddy.
对  谢谢012---Yeah, thanks.
我有很多事要做  罗斯很好心012---I had a lot of work to do, and Ross, nice guy that he is,
主动说要帮忙012---offered to help me out.
我们边喝酒边聊天012---And then we had a little wine, we got to talking.
接下来罗斯突然就对我采取了主动012---And next thing you know, out of nowhere, Ross comes on to me.
这很容易让人误会012---That's a little misleading.
什么  你刚刚说的谎话012--- What is?  The lie you just told.
我说是你主动的  没错012--- That you came on to me?  There's the one!
但那是真的  老实一点吧012---But you did. Let's be honest.
没错  老实一点吧012---Yes, let's.
那不重要012---It's not important.
重要的是我们要生孩子了012---What's important is, we're having a baby,
谁先泡"随"并不重要012---and it doesn't matter who came on to who.
是"谁"才对012---"Whom."
没错012---That's right.
你先吻我的012---You know you kissed me first.
什么  是你求我吻你的012---What? You were begging to kiss you!
你处处给我发送暗号012---You were sending me signals all over the place!
我向你发暗号  对012--- I was sending signals?  Yeah.
谁觉得是我向罗斯012---Please. Okay. Anyone in this room think
发送乞求暗号的012---that I'd actually send Ross begging signals?
请举手012---Please, show of hands.
别人怎么想并不重要012---You know, it doesn't matter what people believe!
重要的是发生了什么012---What matters is what happened.
罗斯  跟我解释一下暗号的事012---Okay, so these signals, Ross, explain this to me,
或许我得小心一点012---'cause maybe I need to be more careful.
我正在发送讯号吗012---Am I sending these signals right now?
你知道吗  瑞秋  别纠结这个问题了012---You know what? You know what? Rachel, just drop it.
拜托告诉我  我是怎么求你的012---No, please. Show me how I begged you.
我可以证明  我都录在录影带里了012---I can show you! I have it on videotape.
那不过是一种表达方法012---It's an expression.
我不敢相信他录下他们做爱的经过012---I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex.
对  你录之前要先告诉对方才行012---Yeah. You gotta tell a girl before you tape her.
那是菜鸟才会犯的错误012---Such a rookie mistake.
你知道谁家有很棒的摄影机吗012---You know who has a great camera?
葛瑞格跟珍妮012---Greg and Jenny?
你还想打电话给他们吗012---Do you still want to call them?
我想打给他们  快打吧012--- I want to call them.  Let's call them.
问他们有没有买纪念品送给朋友012---Ask them if they brought their friends souvenirs.
喂  第八街外送餐厅012---Hello. 8th Street Deli?
快挂掉  光跟他们说话你就会食物中毒012---Hang up. You get food poisoning just talking to that place.
抱歉  打错了  来吧  宝贝012--- Sorry, wrong number.  Here you go, babe.
喂  又是外送餐厅012---Hello? It's the deli again!
好吧  我要吃三明治012---All right, I'll have a sandwich.
我觉得这个电话号码是错的012---I don't think this number's right.
怎么  你们拿到假电话了012--- What?  You got fakenumbered.
什么  没有人会那么做  我们会012--- What? People don't do that.  Oh, I think we do.
他们给了我们假号码012---They gave us a fake number?
他们为什么要那么做  我不知道012--- Why would they do that?  I don't know.
跟你聊天很开心012---You were a delight to talk to.
你问了一些很有见解的问题012---You asked all those insightful, great questions.
你也很风趣  一直在开玩笑012---And you've never been funnier. I mean, joke, joke, joke!
你真的很耍宝012---You were a hoot!
别担心了  你们还有我跟菲比012---Don't worry about it. You still got me and Phoebe.
对不起  我不要葛瑞格跟珍妮的退货012---Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
瑞秋不肯跟我说话  她连门都不肯开012---Rachel won't talk to me. She won't open the door.
我很好奇是为什么  变态012---I wonder why, pervert.
好吧  我不是变态012---Okay, listen, I am not a pervert.
变态都是那么说的012---That's, like, the pervert motto.
举起你的右手  把左手插进裤子里012---Raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants
再重复那句话012---and repeat that.
我不是故意要拍瑞秋012---Filming Rachel was not something I planned.
事情的经过是这样的  乔伊可以帮我作证012---Okay, look. Here's what happened. Joey can back me up on this.
还记得一个半月前  我跑去问你一个问题吗012---A month and a half ago, remember I came to you with a problem?
我的私人问题012---The personal thing?
什么私人间题  关于性的问题012--- What personal thing?  About sex?
我好几个月没有性生活了012---That I hadn't had sex in months?
我刚才就知道你的是哪件事012---Yeah, I knew what you were talking about.
你有空吗012---Do you have a minute?
我想谈一件我很难启齿的事012---I'd like to talk about something I'm uncomfortable talking about.
没问题012---Sure.
你跟你妈一起洗澡如何012---How about you showering with your mom?
我已经想好问题了012---I actually had a topic in mind.
我进入了干涸期012---I'm kind of going through a dry spell,
在性生活方面012---sexwise.
有好几个月了吗  五个月...012--- For, like, months?  Five, to be...
骗人的  是六个月012---...lying. Six.
六个月  那一定很难熬012---Six months? That's rough.
没有那么糟糕012---It's not all bad.
我学着去欣赏生活中的一些小事  譬如说012---I'm learning to appreciate the small things in life, like...
鸟的叫声跟天空的颜色012---...the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
天空是蓝色的  罗斯  我昨天才做过爱012---The sky's blue, Ross. And I had sex yesterday.
拜托  帮帮我  我今晚有约会012---Please help me. I have a date tonight.
我得顺利达阵  我很担心自己的健康012---It has to go well. I'm scared for my health.
好的  好的012---Okay, okay.
我有个点子  我想出一个故事012---I got something. It's this story that I came up with.
非常浪漫  听到这个故事的女人都会心动012---Very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it is putty.
真的吗  说吧  好012--- Really? Tell it to me.  Okay.
你听完后定会想跟我上床012---Now, you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it.
记住  那只是一个故事012---Remember, it is just the story.
我会试着控制自己012---I'll try to control myself.
好012---Okay.
多年前  我在西欧自助旅行012---Years ago, I was backpacking across Western Europe...
你在西欧自助旅行012---You were backpacking across Western Europe?
你再干涸六个月去吧  罗斯012---Have a nice six more months, Ross.
好吧  抱歉  求求你012---Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Please, please.
你去了西欧  然后012---You were in Western Europe, and...?
我在巴塞罗那郊外012---I was just outside Barcelona,
在第比达包山脚下健行012---hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.
我走到小路的尽头012---I was at the end of this path,
来到一片林中空地  发现了一座湖012---and I came to a clearing and there was a lake.
它非常隐密  四周都是高大的树木012---Very secluded. There were tall trees all around.
那里非常安静  美极了012---It was dead silent. Gorgeous.
我看到在湖的对面012---And across the lake I saw
有个美女在洗澡012---a beautiful  woman bathing herself.
但她在哭012---But she was crying.
为什么012---Why?
酒真的很棒012---This is great wine.
是法国酒012---It's from France.
法国在欧洲012---In Europe.
就在西欧012---Western Europe.
几年前012---You know, a few years ago
我在西欧自助旅行012---I was backpacking across Western Europe.
真的吗  等一下  后面的故事更精彩012--- Really?  Wait, it gets better.
对  我在巴塞罗那012---Yeah, I was in Barcelona.
我在巴塞罗那念过一年书012---I studied for a year in Barcelona.
总之我在健行...012---So anyway, I was hiking...
我喜欢健行  那真的太棒了012--- I love hiking!  That's great!
我在第比达亚波山脚下健行...012---I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo...
我想是"第比达包山"才对012---I think it's "Tibidabo."
你想来讲这个故事吗012---Okay, do you want to tell the story?
你怎么来了  约会还顺利吗012---What are you doing here? How'd your date go?
太棒了 我正要过街去和她做爱012---Great. I'm across the street having sex right now.
你的故事烂透了012---Your story sucks.
如果不起作用  一定是你说的方法不对012---Look, if it didn't work, it's because you didn't tell it right.
告诉我你是怎么说的  不  我不想谈012--- Show me how you did it.  No, I don't want to.
你上次看到裸女是什么时候的事012---How long since you seen a girl naked?
我在西欧自助旅行012---I was backpacking across Western Europe...
我没有感觉012---I'm not feeling it.
我在巴塞罗那郊外健行012---I was outside Barcelona, hiking...
罗斯  我并没觉得欲火焚身  你呢012---No, Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
我六个月没做爱  每天都欲火焚身012---It's been six months. I'm always hot.
你讲故事不够动人  你根本就不相信它012---You're not selling the story. You don't believe it.
我得走了  我有约会  但试试这招012---I gotta go, I got a date. But try this.
学我在试镜前做的那一招012---Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition.
不  我帮你设置好录像机012---No. I'll set you up with my video camera
你可以自拍看看哪里做错了012---and you could record yourself and see what you're doing wrong.
我会试试看012---I'll try that.
已经设定好了  可以拍了012---Alright, now, you're all set up. You're good to go.
按下录影键就可以了  祝你好运 谢谢012--- Just hit record.  Good luck. Thanks.
乔伊  如果你跟女人约会出了问题012---Hey, Jo, listen. If you ever have any problem with the ladies,
我可以帮你012---you know I'll help you out.
那对我来说意义重大012---That means a lot to me, man.
你好啊012---Hello.
需要我帮你效劳吗  要擦镜头吗012---Can I get you anything? Lens cleaner?
电池还有电吗012---Your battery okay?
罗斯  谢天谢地你在这里  快帮帮我012---Ross, thank God you're here. You have to help me.
你在自言自语吗012---Were you talking to yourself?
那样说会比较不丢脸  对  没错012---That's less embarrassing. Yes. Yes, I was.
她一走进来  我一分心012---So when she came in, I got distracted
就完全忘记了录影机的事012---and totally forgot about the camera.
录影机拍录下了整个经过012---It kept rolling and recorded everything.
我们得看看那卷录影带012---Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
真是个好主意  那会让瑞秋原谅我012---What a great idea! That'll get Rachel to forgive me.
那对她来说不公平  忘了录影带的事吧012---You know what? It's not fair to her. Let's forget the tape.
谢谢012---Thank you.
不行  你说得对012--- No.  You're right.
乔伊  不行  我了解012--- Joey, no.  Loud and clear.
我不明白为什么葛瑞格和珍妮012---I still don't get why Greg and Jenny
要给我们假的电话号码012---would give us a fake number.
如果他们是这方面的老手012---You know, if they knew what they were doing,
甚至都不会给你们真名012---they probably didn't give you real names, either.
或许有人会给假电话号码012---Maybe people give out fake numbers,
但没有人会给假名012---but they don't give out fake names.
是吗  嗨  肯·亚当斯很高兴能认识你012---Oh, yeah? Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.
瑞吉娜·费兰吉012---Regina Phalange.
真不懂  我们没做错事  就是嘛012--- I just don't get it. We didn't do anything wrong.  I know.
虽然你说了很多冷笑话012---Although you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
你说很好笑啊  快讲笑话吧012---You said they were funny. Joke, joke, joke!
讲笑话...012---Joke, joke...
可能是你问了太多问题害的012---Or maybe it was your questions.
我的问题怎么了012---What about my questions?
你问了太多问题012---The sheer volume.
像是跟谜题王坐在一起012---It was like flying with the Riddler.
你又在讲笑话吗  你又在问问题吗012--- I'm soory. Was that another joke?  Was that another question?
罗斯还在吗012---Is Ross still here?
他走了  但他告诉我们发生了什么事012---No, Rach, he's gone, but, listen, he told us what happened.
听起来真的是个误会012---It does sound like an honest mistake.
是吗  如果我把我跟你做爱的过程录下来012---Really? How would you like it if I had sex with you
你会有什么感觉呢012---and I taped it?
算了吧012---Oh, forget it.
他来了  我孩子他爹012---There he is, the father of my child,
西村的黄片之王012---the porn king of the West Village.
那是个意外  行吗012---Look, it was an accident, okay?
我觉得很内疚  我发誓我还没有看过它012---I feel bad that happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it.
总之  拿去吧012---Anyway, here.
或许亲手毁了它  你会觉得舒服一点012---I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
谢谢012---Thank you.
什么012---What?
你们不想看这玩意吧  我们当然想012--- You don't want to see this, do you?  Hell, yeah!
我不会让你们看这个012---I am not gonna show you this.
我们不是要看性爱镜头012---Not the sex part.
只是想看你们怎么开始的012---Just the stuff leading up to it.
算了  让她毁掉吧012---Forget it. She's destroying it.
我们会想其他办法012---Okay, fine, fine. We'll think of another way
解决"谁先主动"的问题012---to put the "who came on to who" thing to rest.
快想012---Come on now, think!
别想这事了  菲比  那是瑞秋的录影带012---Forget it, Phoebe, okay? It's Rachel's tape,
她想怎么处置它是她的自由012---and she can do whatever she wants with it.
她想毁了它  别说了012---And she wants to destroy it, so end of story.
我想看  什么012--- I want to see it.  What?
你显然不希望大家看这盘录影带012---Clearly, you don't want people to see this tape.
我也不想让大家看012---I don't want people to see this tape, either.
但你非常不希望我们看012---But you so badly don't want us to see it
让我想要看个究竞  明白吗012---that it makes me want to see it. Do you see?
我们到底要不要看录影带012---Are we watching the tape or not?
我不让别人看是为了保护你012---I don't want people to see it for your sake.
我不相信你012---I don't believe you.
我想你不希望他们看到你求我012---I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
瑞秋  求你了  这算是预告部份012--- Rachel, please?  Oh, a little preview.
好吧  我要这卷录影带证明012---Fine. Fine. But I want the record to show
我是想保护你012---that I tried to take the high road.
因为再过五分钟我会说...012---Because in about five minutes, I'm gonna be saying...
好吧  要开始了012---Okay, here we go.
你好啊  需要我帮你效劳吗012---Hello. Can I get you anything?
我好开心012---I'm so happy.
谢天谢地你在这里  罗斯  快帮帮我012---Thank God you're here, Ross. Help me.
你在自言自语吗012---Were you talking to yourself?
我出现了  你就要怀孕了012--- There I am.  You're gonna get pregnant.
我搞砸了012---I screwed up so bad.
好几个星期前我告诉莫妮卡012---I told Monica that I'd send
我会把喜帖寄出去012---all those wedding invitations weeks ago.
你没有寄012---You didn't do it?
我把它们放在办公桌上  直到今天才想起来012---I put them in my desk at work, and forgot about them until today.
亲爱的  没关系的012---Sweetie, it's okay.
客人都来了  我没事的012---Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
但你把我的手弄痛了  我知道012--- Kind of hurting my hand though.  I know.
我竟然会做出这种事012---I can't believe I did this,
何况莫妮卡每天都在嘱咐我这件事012---especially after Monica went on and on and on about it.
喜帖在这里  瑞秋  小心点  瑞秋012---"Okay, Rachel. Here are the invitations, Rachel. Be very careful, Rachel.
拜托  别在喜帖附近喝东西  瑞秋012---Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations, Rachel."
你们在我们的喜帖上面做爱了吗012---Did you do it on our invitations?
我们没在寄出去的喜帖上做012---Not on the ones we sent out.
你们在我们裱起来的喜帖上面做爱了012---So just the ones you gave back to us and we had framed?
一切都发生得太快了012---Can you believe it's already happening?
感觉上他们像是昨天才订婚012---It seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
我知道012---I know.
还记得他们订婚那一晚吗012---Remember that night they got engaged?
你跟我差一点...012---How you and I almost...
我记得我们差一点就做了012---Oh, I remember how we almost.
你觉得我们当时真的会做吗012---You think we would've gone through with it?
如果没被逮到的话012---If we haven't gotten caught.
你觉得我们会做吗012---You think we would have done it?
我知道我想做  但我不知道你想不想012---I know I wanted to. I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
我也想012---Oh, I wanted to.
那么我们两个都想012---So we both wanted to.
有意思012---Interesting.
总之012---Anyway,
这样的结果或许是最好的012---it probably worked out for the best.
没错012---Yeah, sure.
再过十秒他就要吻我了012---In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.
再过五秒你们就会知道为什么012---In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.
我有没有跟你说过012---Ross, did I ever tell you about the time
我到西欧自助旅行的事012---that I went backpacked through Western Europe?
准备看她求我吧012---Get ready to see some begging.
是你对罗斯主动的012---Oh, you came on to Ross!
什么012---What?
现在我好开心012---Now I'm so happy.
你这是什么意思  你用了欧洲的故事012--- What are you talking about?  You used the Europe story!
那是你想做爱时会用的魔法故事012---That's the magic story you use when you want to have sex!
你怎么知道那个故事012---How do you know about that story?
你怎么知道那个故事012---How do you know about that story?
是一个家伙告诉我朋友艾琳的012---My friend Irene heard it from some guy.
就是我012---Some guy!
不  她说那个家伙叫做肯·亚当斯012---No, she told me that his name was Ken Adams.
