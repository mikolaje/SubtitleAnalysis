另一个〝我们〞012---The other "us."
好吧012---Okay.
我们要结婚了012---We're getting married.

我们希望你参加  如果你不来我们也能够理解012---We'd like you to come. We understand if you don't want to.
我为什么不去呢  上次婚礼我很快乐012---Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
我只是想说…012---I just thought that...
我为何不能替你们高兴呢  如果我不能…012---Why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me...

如果她嫁给别的男人  你们绝对不会期望我去的012---If she were marrying a guy, you wouldn't expect me to go.
如果她嫁给一个男人  她就是最烂的女同志了012---If she were marrying a guy, she'd be the worst lesbian ever.
我错过了吗012---Did I miss it?
没有  这个家伙自杀后就换我了012---No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
她很漂亮012---Whoa, she's pretty.
她人也很好012---And she's really nice.
她教我怎么在摄影机前演戏012---She taught me about how to work with the cameras...
还有“闻屁味”演戏法012---...and smell-the-fart acting.
抱歉  什么  你说什么012---I'm sorry, what? Excuse me?
要这么短的时间记住这么多台词012---You got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes...

就像这样012---Like this:

我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
你也未免让她太放松了吧012---That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
是啊012---Yeah, uh-huh.
她已经82岁了012---Um, she was, you know, 82 years old...
她叫艾道曼太太012---...and her name was, um, Mrs. Adelman.
亲爱的012---Oh, honey.
感觉好奇怪012---It's just so strange. You know...
她可能今天早上起床时想〝我先吃点早餐…012---...she probably woke up this morning and thought...
散个步  然后去按摩一下〞012---...I'll have some breakfast, take a walk, then have my massage.
但是她不知道上帝想说〝好的  但是到此为止〞012---Little did she know God thought, "Okay, but that's it."
但是最诡异的一件事就是…012---Oh, but the weirdest thing was...
她死的时候  我正在帮她清理灵气012---...I was cleansing her aura when it happened.
当她的灵魂离开身体…012---And when her spirit left her body...
我不认为它走远了012---...I don't think it went very far.
这是什么意思012---What do you mean?
我想它上了我的身012---I think it went into me.
真的好难喔012---This is so hard.
我没法决定要选羊肉还是鸭肉012---I can't decide between lamb or duck.
羊肉比较恐怖012---Well, lambs are scarier.
要不然那部电影就会叫做沉默的鸭子012---Or the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
好了  谁点了什么012---Okay, who ordered what?
我是点了喝了一半上面还有唇印的卡布奇诺012---I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
这杯里面有烟屁股的  是无咖啡因的吗012---And this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
我的天啊012---Oh, God.
我真不相信你妈过来  你会这么紧张012---You're so uptight about your mom coming.
我知道  我不想让她那样认为只是因为012---I know. I just don't want her to think that because...
我没嫁给巴瑞  我的人生就是垃圾012---...I didn't marry Barry my life is crap.

不停地重复她跟罗德·史戴格老掉牙的故事012---...tell her story about Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
菲比  你想她会跟我们在一起多久012---Uh, Pheebs? How long do you think this lady will be with us?
不知道  老太太显然还有什么心愿没完成呢012---I don't know. She obviously has some unfinished business.
坐直012---Sit up!
她在那边012---There she is!

真是太棒了012---Oh, it's wonderful!
这是客厅  还是餐厅  谁分得出来呢012---Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?
我猜乐趣就在那儿吧012---I guess that's the fun.
差不多啦  这是我的朋友012---Pretty much. Here, meet my friends.
摩妮卡  你看起来真美012---Monica! You look gorgeous!

我从我父亲的家直接到大学妹妹会之家012---I went from my father's house to the sorority house...

真的012---Really?
我知道你让我想起谁012---I know who you remind me of.
艾芙林·邓末012---Evelyn Durmer.
她做拉皮手术失败之前  现在她长得像苏比·赛尔斯012---That's before the lousy face-lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
菲比  艾芙林·邓末是谁012---Pheebs? Ha, ha. Who's Evelyn Durmer?
我不知道  谁是苏比·赛尔斯012---I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
我的天012---Oh, my God!
那边有一个丑男光着身子在拉大提琴012---There's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
还好他没有演奏小一点的乐器012---Just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
你的生活真棒  小乖乖012---You have some life here, sweetie!
妈  我知道你和爸爸都很生气  我没嫁给巴瑞012---Mom, I realize you were upset when I didn't marry Barry...
住在郊外的大房子里  什么都有保障012---...and get the house in the suburbs with all the security.
但是这对我来说好多了012---This is just so much better for me.
我知道  你不爱巴瑞012---I know. You didn't love Barry, honey.
我从没看你这么快乐过012---And I've never seen you this happy.
我看着你  然后想〝这就是我想要的〞012---I look at you and I think, "This is what I want."
是说我吧012---For me.
不只是你012---Well, not just for you.
什么意思012---What do you mean?
我正考虑离开你爸爸012---I'm, uh, considering leaving your father.

同性恋婚礼  鸡胸肉012---Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
天啊  我想我快吐了012---Oh, God. I think I'm gonna be sick.
怎样  我又没在上面加小乳头012---What? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
你不知道他们感情不好  不知道012---You had no idea?  None.
他们不常吵架012---They didn't fight?
才不会  他们根本不说话012---No, they didn't even talk to each other.
我怎么会知道他们之间有问题啊012---How was I suppose to know they were having problems?
在我的年代  是不能离婚的012---You know, in my day, divorce was not an option.
看是谁来了012---Hey, look who's up!
我真不敢相信会发生这种事012---I just can't believe this is happening.
我小时候  每个人的父母都在闹离婚012---When I was little, all parents got divorced.
我想我已经长大了  就不用担心这个问题012---I figured as an adult, I wouldn't have to worry about it.
你可以把这件事当做是种赞美吗012---Can't you look at this as flattering?
她这么做是因为想跟你一样012---She just wants to be like you.
她不能模仿我的发型就好了吗012---Well, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
我父母离婚时  他们要我去看心理医师012---When my parents divorced, they sent me to a shrink...
她跟我说孩子都会责怪自己012---...and she told me that kids blame themselves.
但你的状况还真是这样012---But in your case, it's actually kind of true.
他来了012---Oh, that's him.

很高兴见到你  谢谢你过来012---Nice to see you.  Thanks for coming.
没关系  尽管你的确打扰了我忙碌呆坐的一天012---That's okay. Although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
要不要坐下012---Um, do you wanna sit?
不用了  我花了整个早上才站起来的012---No, I spent most of my morning trying to stand up.
我能为你做些什么  亲爱的012---What can I do for you, my dear?
好吧  我不知道该怎么说012---Okay, I don't know how to say this, but, um...
我认为当你太太的灵魂脱离身体时012---...I think when your wife's spirit left her body...
有一点困在…012---...it, um, kind of stuck around...
我的身体里012---...in me.
你说我老婆附在你身上012---You're saying my wife is in you?
对  你不用相信我  但是…012---Yeah. You don't have to believe me, but...
你知道她有什么没完成的愿望吗012---...um, can you think of any unfinished business she had?
有什么原因让她留下来吗012---Any reason to hang around?
我不知道该怎么说012---I don't know what to say.
我唯一想到的就是…012---All I can think of is that...
她常说在死之前  她想要看遍世间所有事012---...she used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
所有事  所有事012---Everything?  Everything.
这样  那可真不少012---Whoa. That's a lot of stuff.
等等…012---Oh, wait, I...
我记得她也说  她想跟我上最后一次床012---I remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
对不起  我脑袋里出现笑声012---I'm sorry. There's laughing in my head.
值得一试  对吧012---Worth a shot, huh?
你看这个012---Ha, ha. Look at this.
这些是三年前的万圣节012---These are all Halloween, three years ago.
你看  巴瑞在这里012---Oh, and look, here's Barry.
他从办公室直接过去012---He came straight from the office?
不  那是他的变装服012---Oh, no. That was his costume.
他其实是牙齿矫正医师  但是他装扮成一般的牙医012---See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
两位012---Um, you guys?
记得我之前说  谢谢  我不需要你们帮忙012---Remember when I said that I don't need your help?
你其实是说…012---Actually, I think you said:
〝别碰那个  滚出我的厨房〞012---"Don't touch that and get out of my kitchen."
真的  真奇怪  不管怎样…012---Really? Weird. Anyway...
我计划得很好  计划再计划012---I planned really well. I planned and planned.

她还跟着你012---She's still with you?
对啊  我想她还没看完吧012---Yes. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.
我马上回来  她又得跑厕所了012---Be right back. She has to go to the bathroom again.
这脸蛋真漂亮012---Such a pretty face!
真的好好玩喔  只有女生012---Oh, this is so much fun. Just the girls.
你知道我们该做什么  你们有大麻吗012---Do you know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
天啊！012---God!
听着  不准在这些食物旁抽大麻012---Look, no one's smoking pot around all this food.
那就算了012---Well, that's fine.

我在切  我在切  什么都没听到012---I'm dicing. I'm dicing. I don't hear anything.
这不是不尊重你爸  但是我在想…012---This is no offense to your dad, but I was thinking...
可能有更精釆的012---...there might be more.
你知道吗  我不能跟你谈这件事了012---You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you.
好啦012---All right.
你还没告诉爸爸  就来先跟我丢这个炸弹012---You come here and drop this bomb on me before you even tell Daddy.
难道你要我祝福你  要我说服你不要这样012---Do you want my blessing? Want me to talk you out of it?
那你到底想怎样012---Then what do you want?
我想只有你会了解012---I guess I figured you would understand.
为什么我会了解012---Why on earth would I understand this?
你没嫁给你的巴瑞  女儿012---You didn't marry your Barry, honey.
但是我嫁给我的巴瑞012---But I married mine.
噢012---Oh.

或是不要那么自私012---Or something a little less selfish.
卡萝  怎么了  发生什么事012---What's the matter? What happened?

我知道他们不能接受这件事012---I knew they were having trouble with this, but...
但他们是我父母  应该把我嫁出去  我很遗憾012---...they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away.
苏珊和我大吵一架  我说应该取消婚礼012---Susan and I fought because I said maybe we should call it off.
她说〝这不是为了他们  是为了我们〞012---She said, "This isn't for them. It's for us."
如果我不了解这个的话  那就应该取消婚礼012---And if I couldn't see that, we should cancel the wedding.
我不知道该怎么做012---I don't know what to do.
我不敢相信我会这么说  但是苏珊说的对012---I, uh, can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
