老天  你们不会相信的012---Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You are not gonna believe this.
我被发掘了012---I have just been discovered.
等一下  四年前我就以法国之名  将你据为己有012---Wait a minute. I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
总之…012---Anyway.
你们要答应我不要疯掉  也不要说有多棒   直到我说完012---Promise you won't freak out and say how great this is until I'm done.
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
我刚认识了一位  小唱片公司的制作人…012---Uh, I just met this producer of this teeny record company...
她说我有一副  清新  与众不同的嗓音…012---...who said, ahem, that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound...
她想请我录《臭猫》的试唱带012---...and she wants to do a demo of "Smelly Cat."
我刚说过别这样了012---Okay, I told you not to do that yet. Ha, ha.
好012---Okay.
她还要拍音乐录影带012---And she wants to do a video.
我还没讲完  好吗012---I'm not done yet, okay? Ha, ha.
天啊012---God. Okay.
如果一切顺利  他们还可能出一张专辑012---If that goes well, they may even want to make an album.

罗斯  如果你爱我  那你就把派  从那人的的风帽上拿起来012---Oh, God, Ross, if you care about me, get the pie out of the man's hood.
拿什么  他的风帽上有块派012---Get the what? There's a pie in the hood. Go.
你在干嘛  抱歉  我的派掉进你的风帽里了012---What are you doing?  I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.
现在我得从那家伙的裤裆里把咖啡弄出来…012---I have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants...
然后我七点前要赶回医院去012---...and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
可恶  罗斯  快滚出厕所012---Damn it, Ross. Get your butt out of the bathroom.
别紧张  我在吹头发012---Calm down. I'm blow-drying.
吹什么头发  你根本没有头发012---Blow-drying what? You have no hair.
怎么回事012---What's going on?
你男友在里头待了超过一小时012---Uh, your boyfriend has been in there for an hour.
真不敢相信  这就好像我又跟他住在一起012---It's like I'm living with him again.
我要睡觉时他在这里  醒来时也在  我要洗澡时他也在012---He's here when I go to sleep, when I wake up, when I wanna shower.
我感觉好像又回到十六岁012---Uh, I feel like I'm 16 again.
你已经不是十六岁了  而且你们两个又都是成年人了012---Well, you're not 16. You're both adults now.
快出来  蠢货012---Get out, you doofus!
其实  你们半斤八两012---Or, you know, he's rubber and you're glue.
都是你的了012---All yours.
你最好有把排水孔上的毛发清干净012---I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
你最好有把排水孔上的毛发清干净012---I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
闭嘴  闭嘴012---Shut up.  Shut up.
别这样012---Cut it out.
你以后别再这样了012---I've never wanted you more.
你们怎么说  我该不该打电话给他012---So, what do you say, boys? Should I call him?
人家就是这样说的012---You know what they say:
〝问你拖鞋一个问题…012---Ask your slippers a question...
你一定是疯了〞012---...you're going crazy.
你好  嘿012---Hello? Hey.
嘿012---Hey.
抱歉  我今天没过去012---Listen, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
没关系012---Oh, that's okay.
因为你有事嘛012---You, uh... You had a thing.
我听说你那里很棒012---Yeah, well, I hear the place looks great.
别提了  我愉快得很012---Oh, forget about it. I'm having a ball, ha.

我只是012---Yeah, I just...
想打个电话打声招呼012---...wanted to call and say hey.
好012---Well, okay, then.
那是烤箱计时器的声音吗012---Was that the oven timer?
没错  好朋友012---That's right, my friend.
现在是看…  《海滩游侠》的时候了012---It's time for Baywatch!  Baywatch!
噢012---Oh.
你能相信他们居然让史黛芬妮得了皮肤癌吗012---Can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
我真不敢相信他们升她为小队长012---I can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
你会这么说是因为你爱上雅丝敏布莉012---You're saying that because you love Yasmine Bleeth.
怎么可能有人不爱雅丝敏布莉012---How could anyone not love Yasmine Bleeth?
嘿  在跑步了012---Hey. Hey, they're running.
这正是全片的精华所在012---See, this is the brilliance of the show.
他们应该继续跑下去012---I say always keep them running.
从头跑到尾012---All the time running.
跑吧012---Run.
跑吧012---Run.
跑啊  雅丝敏  像阵风快跑012---Run, Yasmine. Run like the wind.
但之前你说想一个人住的012---But you wanted to live by yourself.
是啊  我还以为那样会很好012---I did. I thought it'd be great.
我以为那样一来  我就有时间好好思考012---I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.
但结果我发现  我根本没有你认为的那么多好思考的012---But it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
那你何不找钱德商量  然后搬回去好了012---Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
你们真的认为他会收容我吗012---You really think he'd take me?
昨晚我们聊得很好…012---We had a good talk last night...
但是当初我搬出去时  我伤他很深012---...but when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
我保证  他一定会欢迎你搬回去的012---I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
他才不会搬回来012---I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
但我们昨晚真的聊得非常愉快012---But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. Heh.
那就好像…012---I mean, it was...
我们当初刚搬在一起住时一样012---It was like when we first started living together.
我知道你不想听…012---Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now...
但我们看到他在新家的样子  他真的很快乐012---...but we've seen him in his new place. And he's happy.
他真的装潢过了012---He's decorated.
钱德  他已经向前迈出去  好吗  你也不要眷恋过去012---Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay? You have to, too.
你要接受现在你们只是朋友的事实012---No, you're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now.
你们不再是…012---You're not...
室友了012---...roommates anymore.
好了  菲比  准备好了吗012---Okay, Phoebe. Ready to try one?
好012---Okay. Ahem.
臭猫  臭猫012---Smelly cat, smelly cat

臭猫  臭猫012---Smelly, smelly, smelly
真的很臭的臭猫012---Really bad smelling smelly cat
哇  天啊012---Oh, whoa! Oh, my God!

她们是你的合音天使  就在你的后面  亲爱的012---They're your backup singers. Behind you, hon.
噢012---Oh.
我以为她们只是来参观的012---Oh, I thought they were just watching me.
就像是在看水族馆一样  好012---Like at an aquarium, you know?  All right.
从头开始  好012---From the top.  Okay. Ahem.
臭猫  臭猫012---Smelly cat, smelly cat

好了  抱歉012---Okay, sorry.
我没感觉到…012---I'm just not getting...
…大家都懂…012---...that everyone, um, gets...
…这只猫到底有多臭012---...how smelly this cat actually is.
或许我们可以聊一下这个012---Maybe if we could talk about this...
因为我想要感觉到你们真的在乎这只猫012---...because I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
这我们可以谈012---Honey, we can talk about this.
只不过这里一分钟的租金要一百块美金012---It's just that it's costing about $100 a minute to be in here.
好吧  那只猫是很臭  不过你们还是爱他  我们开始012---Oh, okay. So, um, the cat stinks, but you love it. Let's go.
不  他不可能是迅猛龙012---No, there is no way he was a velociraptor.
看他高耸的头盖骨012---Look at the cranial ridge, okay?
如果恐龙狄诺是迅猛龙  他早就把摩登原始人一家吃掉了012---If Dino was a velociraptor, he'd have eaten the Flintstones.
没错012---Yeah. Yeah.
噢  你刚在睡午觉吗012---Oh, were you taking a nap?
本来是  噢  我…012---I was.  Oh, I...
请你等一下  我有插拨012---Oh, wait, Tony, can you hold on? That's the other line.
喂012---Hello?
是的  她在  但可以请她回电吗012---Yeah, she's here, but, uh, can she call you back?

她有留电话号码吗012---Did she leave a number?
你有看我抄下来吗012---Did you see me write one down?
我没有她电话号码  浑蚤012---I don't have her number, butt-munch.
她会再拨回来的  别这么幼稚012---Well, she'll call back. Don't be such a baby.
我不幼稚  你才幼稚012---I'm not a baby. You're the baby.
别烦我  那你就别来惹我012---Look, you wanna get off my back? Get out of my face.
等一下  东尼  等一下…012---Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.
你好012---Hello?

东尼  我可以晚点再打给你吗012---Hi, Tony, can I call you back?
我妹的男友打来了012---That's, uh... That's my sister's boyfriend.
还我啦012---Give me that.
好012---Okay.
亲爱的  趁我还没忘记  我的子宫帽是不是忘在你那里012---Sweetie, before I forget, did I leave my diaphragm at your place?
嗨  妈012---Hi, Mom.
嘿012---Hey. Yeah, ha, ha.
皇宫情况如何012---So, uh, how's the palace?
你居然会提到  因为我才在想…012---It's funny you should mention that because I was thinking...
那些盒子是怎样012---What's with the boxes?
噢  我有个消息要告诉你012---Oh, uh, actually, I, uh, have some news.
乔伊会回来把他的麋鹿帽子拿走  还是要我把它扔了012---Is that Joey guy gonna pick up his moose hat or should I toss it?
你何不亲自问他呢  乔伊  这位是我的新室友艾迪012---Why don't you ask him yourself? This is my new roommate, Eddie.
幸会012---EDDIE: Nice to meet you.
我也是012---Likewise. How you doing?
这给我012---Uh, I'll take that.
我就是为了这个而来的012---It's, uh, what I came for, heh.
这倒是个新闻  你们怎么认识的012---So this is new. Where'd you two meet?
在超级市场  在家乡味食品区012---At the, uh, supermarket in the, uh, ethnic-food section.
我帮他选西班牙辣香肠  耶  哈哈哈012---I helped him pick out a chorizo. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
是个... 我是说...   哇012---It's a... I mean...  Wow.
后来我们聊了一下  他说要找地方住  而我刚好有空房间012---We got to talking. And, uh, he needed a place, and I had a spare room.
这下子那是空房间了012---Oh, now it's a spare room?
是啊  既然没有人在用…012---Well, yeah. In that it's not being used...
我又让它空着012---...and I have it to spare.
对的012---Right.
好了  我拿到我来拿的东西了012---Well, I, uh, got what I came for.
再见了012---I'll, uh... I'll see you guys.

这家伙很有趣吧012---Is this guy great, or what?
对啊012---Yeah.
他是012---Yeah, he is.
我不敢相信他找到新室友了  是谁012---I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
艾迪什么的  他们刚认识012---Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
这关系不会持久的  他不过是  在低潮时填补空档的室友012---It'll never last. He's just a rebound roommate.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
快看  快看012---Ooh, check it out. Oh, check it out.

那又如何  你们也没有人录过音乐录影带啊012---...so what? None of you ever made a video.
好012---Okay.
快滚出去  小猫  你好臭012---Get out of here, cat! You stink!

臭猫  臭猫012---Smelly cat, smelly cat

这真是酷  我现在可以听到你们听到的声音了012---This is so cool. Now I can hear what you hear.
相当不同  对吧012---Pretty, uh, different, huh?

艾迪012---Eddie.
早  早012---Morning.  Morning.
我来拿我的邮件012---I just, uh, came by to pick up my mail.
邮件在哪里  在桌上012---Where's the mail?  Oh, it's, uh, over there on the table.
你现在不像以前那样  放在桌子上了吗012---You don't keep it on this table anymore?
不  艾迪习惯把邮件放那边012---No, Eddie likes it over there.
好吧  给你  艾迪式煎蛋012---All right, here you go, my friend. Eggs à la Eddie, huh.
哦  哦012---Ooh. Ooh.
太棒了012---Oh, oh. That's great.
呵012---Huh.
怎么了012---What?
我还以为你喜欢的是我做的面包夹蛋012---I thought you liked your eggs...
中间还穿个洞的那个012---...with the bread with the hole in the middle, à la me.
我是啊  但艾迪的做法是这样  非常好吃012---I do, but, uh, Eddie makes them this way. They're pretty darn good.
好了  大家012---Well, you guys...
我走了012---...I'm out of here.
再见了012---See you, pals.
再见012---See you.
你们两个相处得怎样   再幸福不过了012---So how are you two getting along?  Oh, I couldn't be happier.
很好012---Great, huh?
我为你感到高兴012---I'm happy for you.
好了  我受够了012---All right, that's it!
他就这样住进来  这位强尼新蛋蛋先生…012---He just comes in here, Mr. Johnny New Eggs...
用他那套大摇大摆地移动我的邮件  还有那套012---...with his moving the mail and his:
〝再见了  大家〞012---"See you, pals."
果汁也没了012---And now there's no juice!
没留果汁给想喝果汁的人  我想喝果汁012---There's no juice for the people who need the juice. I need the juice!
那边还有一盒012---There's another carton right over there.
这不再是关于果汁的事了  好吗012---Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, all right, man?
好吧012---All right.
那么是关于什么呢012---So, what's it about?
蛋012---Eggs.
谁的蛋蛋你比较喜欢  他的还是我的012---Whose eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
两个人的蛋蛋我都喜欢  少来了012---Well, I like both eggs equally. Oh, come on!
没有人会同样喜欢两种蛋012---Nobody likes two kinds of eggs equally.
你一定比较喜欢一种胜过另一种  而我要知道答案012---You like one better, and I wanna know which.
这有什么差别   你的蛋蛋现在又不在这里了012---What's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore.
你把你的蛋蛋带走  然后搬离了这里012---You took your eggs, and you left!
难道你以为我从此  就找不到新蛋蛋了吗012---Did you really expect me to never find new eggs?
今晚我想要看《娱乐百分百》012---I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
才不要  我们要看《赛伦盖提草原上的掠食者》012---Tough. We're watching Predators of the Serengeti.
你们两个别争了  好吗012---Ugh. Would you guys stop?
这是我的电视012---It's my TV! What?
住手  咬我啊012---Quit it.  Bite me!
天啊012---Oh, my God.
摩妮卡一直在转台…012---Well, Monica keeps changing the channel.
好  那你去跟妈妈告状啊012---Aw, that's great. Why don't you tell Mommy on me?
这下子我现在变成妈咪了012---Now I'm Mommy in this little play?
听着  我拒绝被卷入012---Look, I refuse to get sucked into...
这一类畸型的盖勒家庭纠纷  好吗012---...this weird little Geller dimension thing, okay?
所以我要去好好泡个泡泡浴…012---So I'm gonna go take a nice long hot bubble bath...
因为你们两个  真的吵得我快疯了012---...because you kids are driving me crazy!
我们该怎么办012---What do we do about this?
把《娱乐百分百》录下来012---We could tape Entertainment Tonight.
我不是说电视节目012---Not that!
我是说我们012---This! Us!
天啊  罗斯  你真的是…012---Oh, my God, Ross, it's... You're just...

你老是窝在这里012---...all the time!
为什么  你为什么受不了我在这里012---Why? Why can't you stand me being here?
我们相处得很愉快啊012---We're just having fun.
愉快  你认为这叫愉快吗012---Fun? You think this is fun?
是啊012---Yeah.
我还以为我们是  像小时候那样逗着玩的012---I thought we were fooling around, like when, uh... When we were kids.
罗斯  我小时候恨死你了012---I hated you when we were kids.
你小时候恨死我了吗  是012---You hated me when we were kids?  Yes.
我恨死你了012---I hated you.
我就像〝你是我哥  所以我必须爱你〞那样爱你012---I loved you in a you're-my-brother- so-I-have-to way...
但基本上我是恨你的012---...but basically, I hated your guts.
你干嘛要恨我012---Why did you hate me?
