好吧  钱德  摩妮卡  只剩一个香蕉坚果马芬012---Okay, Chandler, Mon, there's only one banana-nut muffin left.
我先说要的012---I ordered mine first.

给我012---Give it to me.
不要012---No.
给我012---Give it to me.
好吧  你可以拿去012---Okay, you can have it.

我到这里就已经在桌上了012---That was there when I got here.
嘿  你们绝对猜不到  谁要在来纽约012---Hey, you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
快点  菲比  在他咽下去之前快告诉我们012---Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he swallows.
好  是雷恩  和我约过会  在海军服役的那个012---Ryan, that guy I went out with who's in the Navy.
你和在海军服役的人约会012---You went out with a guy in the Navy?
是啊  我在华盛顿广场公园  弹吉他时遇到他012---Yeah, I met him while playing guitar in the park.
雷恩给我太妃糖  因为他没有零钱012---Ryan threw in saltwater taffy because he didn't have change.
嘿  所以你就写了 《太妃糖人》012---Hey, is that when you wrote "Saltwater Taffy Man"?
不是012---No. Heh.
不是  他是我的潜艇人 他每两年就会出水一次012---No, he's my submarine guy. He resurfaces, like, every couple years...
然后我们就会一起度过最棒的三天012---...and we have the most amazing three days together.
只不过这一次  他会来两个星期  整整两个星期  也就是〝耶〞012---Only this time, he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means "yay."
等等  这家伙一潜到水底下  就是两年012---So wait, this guy goes down for, like, two years at a time?
这就是舔我的马芬的代价012---That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
嗨012---Hi.
哦  糟糕  发生了什么事012---Oh, no. What happened?
我刚才和卡萝通话  小班得了水痘012---I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got chicken pox.
哦  不  真是的012---Oh, no. You're kidding.
是啊  所以如果你还没有得过  你很可能会得的012---Yeah, so if you haven't had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
好吧  我已经得过了  是啊  我得过了012---Well, I've had it. Yeah, I've had it.
得过了  得过了012---Had it.  Had it.
我从来没有得过  我觉得好孤单  哦  你看012---I've never had it. I feel so left out. Oh, look.
《老友记》 第二季 第23集: 长水痘012---Friends S02E23: The One With the Chicken Pox
亲爱的  你又铺好床了012---Honey, you made the bed again.
我告诉你  你不必这么做  这又不是营地012---I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
所以我猜昨晚偷内裤  是完全不必要的了012---Oh. Then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.
好吧  我要去冲个澡012---Okay, I am going to take a shower.
今天我会唱  吉姆克罗齐的《李洛伊布朗》012---And today I will be singing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."
摩妮卡012---Monica?
嘿  摩妮卡  我有一个问题012---Hey, Mon, I have a question.
李洛伊是整个镇最坏的人012---Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town...
还是整个镇最胖的人012---...or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
最坏的  否则这首歌  就会是《肥肥李洛伊布朗》012---The baddest. Otherwise, the song would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
我只是在等待着你  亲爱的012---I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.
你在重铺床012---Are you remaking the bed?
对不起  对不起  你知道吗  你弄的根本没问题012---I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what? The way you did it, it was just fine.
那你重铺是因为…012---Then you're redoing it because?
如果我告诉你  你会认为我疯了012---If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
反正已经无可避免了012---You're pretty much running that risk either way.
好吧  你看…012---Okay. You see...
棉被的标签不该是在左上角012---...the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner...
应该是在右下角012---...it should be at the bottom right corner.
嗯  这不是太疯狂啊  我只是用简单的方法解释给你听012---- Uh-huh. Well, that's not so crazy. - I'm just easing you in.
好的012---Ha. All right.
好  你有看到这些小花朵吗012---All right, you see these little flower blossoms?
它们应该朝上  不是朝下012---They should be facing up, not down...
因为…好  床头  应该是太阳出来的地方012---...because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be.
你不爱我了  对吧012---You don't love me anymore, do you?
其实  如果可能的话  我更爱你012---Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
真的吗012---Really?
好吧  那么  来吧012---Wow. Well, then, come on.
我想让你看如何  把卫生纸折成三角形012---I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
乔伊  如果你需要工作…012---Joey, if you need something to hold you over...
我这里就可以给你一份工作  当入门处理员012---...I can get you a job right here as an entry-level processor.
那样的工作不用经验吗012---Don't you need experience for a job like that?
并不是很难学012---It's not that hard to learn.
当人发现你不知道你在做什么时… 嘿  你是演员012---And as for people realizing you don't know what you're doing, hey, you're an actor.
就演得像个处理员  人们就会认为你是一位处理员012---Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
嘿  钱德  这是今天上午的预测012---Hey, Chandler. Here's this morning's projections.

嘿  嘿012---Hey  Hey.
乔伊是一位处理员012---Joey is a, uh, fellow processor.
不是开玩笑吧012---No kidding?
哦，是的012---Oh, yeah.
我处理人们要处理的东西  我是他们要找的人012---I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
你在哪儿工作  好吧  我现在在待业中012---Where do you work? Uh, well, right now I'm in between things.
你知道是怎么回事  有一天  你在处理  第二天…012---You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day...
你没有那么多… 可处理了012---...you're not so much processing anymore.
我正告诉乔伊关于  佛莱许曼小组的职缺012---I was telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
佛莱许曼小组012---Fleischman's group.
不管你做什么  不要碰三明治012---Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches.
你们都是怪胎处理员吗012---Are all you processors dorks?
这唇膏你涂起来很棒012---Ugh. This lipstick looks just great on you.
你看起来很美  甜心  真的012---You look fabulous, honey. You really do.
是啊  你确定吗  真的吗012---Yeah, are you sure? Really?
看  你看起来很漂亮  拜托  把灯光调暗012---See, you look beautiful. For God sakes, dim the lights.
我好丑陋012---I'm hideous.
不会有问题的012---It's gonna be okay.
雷恩在水底下很久012---Ryan's been underwater.
他会很高兴看到  你的屁股上没有长牡蛎012---He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnacles on your butt.
进来012---Come in.
嘿  宝贝  我回来了012---Hey, baby, I'm back...
嘿  雷恩  你好吗012---Hey, Ryan. What's up?
这是怎么回事012---What's going on?
不…你必须保持距离  我长了痘痘012---PHOEBE: No, no. You have to stay back. I have the pox.
水痘或天花012---Chicken or small?
是水痘  真是讽刺  考虑到你刚从水底出来012---Chicken, which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
为什么你不在家里的床上  因为我祖母从未得过水痘012---Why aren't you at home in bed?  My grandmother's never had chicken pox.
拜托  拜托  告诉我你得过012---Please, please, tell me you have...
因为…哦  我的天  我忘了你有多么可爱012---...because oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.
对不起  我从来没有得过012---I'm sorry, I never had them. Oh, oh!
如果我有一个愿望  会是组装一台时间机器  回去我还是七岁时012---If I had one wish, it'd be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7...
当吉米豪瑟得水痘时…012---...when Jimmy Hauser had chicken pox...
我会抓住那小子  把他抹遍我的脸012---...I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
是啊  或是你知道  你可以希望  我现在没有得012---PHOEBE: Yeah, or, you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
我可以看看你的脸吗012---Can I please see your face?
不要  你不会想见到  长了痘痘的脸012---No. You don't wanna see a face covered with pox.
你的脸盖满了鲑鱼  我也不会在意012---Your face could be covered with lox, I wouldn't care.
而你讨厌鱼012---PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh.
真好心  好吧012---So sweet. All right.
好吧  你可以看012---Okay, all right. You can see.
这就是我012---This, ahem, is me.
对不起012---Sorry.
我很可怕012---I am scary.
对不起  是闪电…012---Sorry, the lightning...
闪电是不幸的巧合012---Lightning was an unfortunate coincidence.
你看起来很可爱…012---You look lovely. Lovely.
我讨厌这样012---I hate this.
我告诉你  我为我们计划了  最棒的两周012---I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us.
在我脑海里  我们是比这样更接近的012---And almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
菲比  我花了将近八个月的时间  与男人们在钢管中生活012---Phoebe, I've spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men...
一直都在想像这个时刻012---...thinking about this moment.
我不会让一堆…012---I am not gonna let a bunch...
会发痒的斑点挡在我们之间012---...of itchy spots stand between us.
好吧  这是我得过最浪漫的病了012---Okay. This is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
嘿  嘿  第一天过得如何012---Hey. Hey. How's the first day going?
相当不错  就像你说的那样012---Pretty good. It's like you said.
大部分只是把号码从  一列填到另一列012---It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
对啊  就是这样012---Well, there you go.
嘿  大家都好友善012---Hey, and everybody's so nice.
我刚刚才和一位叫珍妮的红头发女士畅谈012---I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
珍妮  东岸开发部门主管的珍妮012---Jeannie? The head of East Coast Operations, Jeannie?
是啊  原来我们的孩子上同一所学校012---Yeah. Turns out our kids go to the same school.
是啊  世界真小  对吧012---Yeah. Small world, huh? Ha, ha.
世界真怪012---Weird world.
你的孩子  我想我的角色应该有孩子012---Your kids?  I figure my character has kids.
那句话我没有一个字听得懂的012---You know, there isn't a part of that sentence that I don't need explained.
嗯  跟你说  当你在演戏时  你需要思考这样的东西012---Well, see, when you're acting, you need to think about stuff like that.
我的角色  约瑟夫处理员…012---My character, Joseph the processing guy...
有两个小女孩  爱绪莉和布莉塔妮012---...has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.
爱绪莉重覆布莉塔妮所做的一切012---Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
嗯  无形的孩子  有时是会这样012---Oh. Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
没错  你知道  约瑟夫和他的妻子  凯伦在考虑生第三个孩子012---Yeah, yeah. You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.
你知道吗012---You know what?
刚刚生了012---Just did.
真的  哇  你一定是有一些  非常强而有力的想像精子012---Really, wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
你知道是什么使痒痒  更糟糕的吗012---You know what makes the itching even worse?
你不停谈论它吗012---That you don't stop talking about it?
好吧  我们玩就好了  好吗012---Fine. Let's just play, okay?
好  好012---Good, okay.
来吧  双六012---Here we go, double sixes.

你在做什么  你在抓痒吗012---What are you doing? Are you scratching?
没有  我这是在祈求好运  好吗012---No. This is what I do for luck, okay?
你在抓痒012---You're scratching.
给我骰子  不要012---Give me the dice.  No.
给我骰子  不要  拿去012---Give me the dice.  No. Here. There.
你看  双六012---Look, double sixes.
我们不能抓痒  你知道的  不能  会留下疤痕012---We can't scratch. You know we can't. We'll scar.
我没法停止这么想  好难喔012---I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard.
我只想拿起这些房子  在我身上磨擦012---I just wanna grab these houses and rub them all over my body.
不行  给我012---No. No.  Give it.

不要动  你在…012---Don't move. What are you?
停  现在就停012---Aah! Stop that. Stop that right now.
你知道  菲比  我是想过你可能会这样012---You know, I might've expected this of you, Phoebe.
但是  雷恩  你是一个军人012---But, Ryan, you're a military man.
你和米尔顿一定要  上船加入我们012---You and Milton have to join us on the boat.
凯伦会准备午餐  你带孩子来  我们会玩得很痛快012---Karen will pack a lunch, you bring the kids. We'll make a day of it.
噢  这听起来很棒  我们得订一个时间012---Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up.

哦  谢谢  谢谢012---Oh, thanks. Thanks.
再见  再见  珍妮 约瑟夫012---Bye-bye, Jeannie. Ha, ha.Bye-bye, Joseph.
好假的一个人012---What a phony.
好了  我敢肯定  当她走下空无一物的码头时  你会给她一个教训012---Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing.
嘿  道格拉斯先生  老板012---Hey, Mr. Douglas.  Sir.
听着  宾  我得到了你的备忘录012---Uh, listen, Bing, I got your memo.

我这组的人  想与家人共度周末的节日012---Well, the people in my group want to spend the holiday with family.
我有家庭  但我会在这里012---I have a family. I'm gonna be here.
是啊  宾  那是怎么一回事呢012---Yeah, Bing. What's that about?
是要让我的人休息一下  知道吗  在道德上012---It's about cutting my people a little slack, you know, for morale.
如果你想看一些粗略的数字  我可以让他们在星期三给你012---If you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
粗略数字012---Rough numbers?
这家公司可不是用  粗略数字建立的对吧  道格拉斯先生012---This company was not built on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?
周二把最后的数字  放在我的办公桌上012---Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
照你说的  老板012---If you say so, sir.
约瑟夫很棒  是不是012---Joseph's good, isn't he?
好吧  我要杀死你012---Well, I'm going to kill you.
嘿  嘿  我只是想约瑟夫  是喜欢搅和事情的人012---Hey, hey, I just figured Joseph's the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.
你知道  进入状况  搅乱一池春水012---You know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
为什么呢012---Why?
听着  我很抱歉  但是  约瑟夫就是这样的人012---Look, I'm sorry, but that's what Joseph does.
好吗  如果你想把事情完成012---Okay? If you try to pull something...
他会拉你一把的012---...he'll call you on it.
他会说〝你想要一把什么〞012---"What are you trying to pull?" he'll say.
胶带012---Ooh. Duct tape.
我也应该带点什么来012---Was I supposed to bring something too?
这是给外面那对抓痒双胞胎的  我用胶带把他们的手捆起来012---This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mitts to their hands.
你还真严厉012---You're strict.
是啊  为他们好012---Yeah, well, it's for their own good.
你知道吗  我喜欢你  把这个标带这样折下去很有效012---You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.
看  急用时就不用花那么多时间来刮了012---See, in a tape emergency, you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
没错012---Exactly. Oh.
天啊  我很喜欢现在  可以在你身边表现得很神经质了012---God, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.
跟我说实话012---Tell me the truth. Hmm.
我不觉得现在你桌子上的东西摆成直角后更好些了吗012---Don't you like it better that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
如果不是直角  就是斜角012---If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
非常好  谢谢012---Very good.  Thank you.
你知道吗   明天我要调你的钟012---You know what? Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.
我的钟怎么了012---You're gonna do what to my clocks?
我要设成我的时间012---I'm gonna set them to my time.
好吧  我糊涂了012---Well, I'm confused.
我们不是一起在共享时间012---I thought we shared time.
没有  没有  你看  我的卧室里我把钟调快了六分钟012---No, no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
你想知道为什么012---You wanna know why?
因为要和厨房有点时差012---Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen?
你知道吗  算了  我不要告诉你  不  快  快告诉我012---You know what? Forget it.  No, come on, come on, tell me.
不  你不明白  不  说吧012---No, you don't understand.  No, come on.
不  你没有这些烦恼的小事情012---No, you don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
不对  这不是真的  事实并非如此012---No, that's not true. That is not true.
哦  是吗  是啊012---Oh, yeah?  Yeah.
好  那告诉我你的事012---All right, well, tell me one of yours.
好吧012---Okay.
哦012---Ah.
有一件  我总是把我的运动袜…012---One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks...
和套装袜分开012---...from my dress socks.
是啊  如果混在一起了呢012---Yeah. What if they get mixed up?
天啊  我会…012---Boy, I would just, uh...
我会不正常的012---I would freak out.
你才不会012---You would not.
我不敢相信  我讨厌这样  你太正常了012---I can't believe this. I hate this. You're too normal.
我不敢相信我的男友  就没有一件事012---I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
我的男朋友  就没有一件事012---My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
看  如果有人偷听到  我的名声就完了012---See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well there.
嘿012---Hey.
道格拉斯先生正在找你  为什么道格拉斯先生要找我012---Mr. Douglas is looking for you. Why? Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
因为他很怀疑你在贷方项目搞鬼012---Because he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
为- 为- 为什么他会怀疑012---Why? Why does he suspect that?
因为一开始  他以为是约瑟夫…012---Because at first, he thought it was Joseph...
不过在问过约瑟夫后  就转向你了012---...but after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you.
无论如何  我想应该告诉你  好了  够了012---Anyway, I just thought you should know. All right. That's it.
听着  乔伊…012---Look, Joey...
对不起  我知道这是  你一生最棒的角色012---...l'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you...
而如果我可以解雇约瑟夫  我会这么做012---...and if I could just fire Joseph, I would.
但遗憾的是012---But unfortunately that's not possible.
我不得不让你们两个都走012---So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
你说什么  每个人都喜欢约瑟夫012---What are you talking about? Everybody loves Joseph.
我不喜欢  我恨约瑟夫012---I don't. I hate Joseph.
好吧  我认为他是一个拍马屁的烂人012---Okay, I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.
哦  是吗012---Oh, yeah?
你不能开除约瑟夫  你知道为什么吗012---Well, you can't fire Joseph. You know why?
他不是在你的部门012---He's not in your department.
好吧…  所以我不能解雇约瑟夫012---All right, okay. All right, so I can't fire Joseph...
不过我可以与他太太上床012---...but, uh, I can sleep with his wife.
不  凯伦  是啊  凯伦012---Not Karen. Yeah, Karen.
我想和她来个一夜情  哦  你知道吗012---I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what?
我刚这么做了012---I just did.
你怎么能这样对我012---What the hell are you doing to me, man?
哦  这不是我012---Oh, it's not me.
这是我的角色012---It's my character.
钱迪012---Chandie.
是啊  这个流氓处理员  专门引诱同事的妻子…012---Yeah, the rogue processor who seduces his coworkers' wives for sport...
然后在第二天嘲笑着012---...and then laughs about it the next day.
事实上  她的内裤  就在我的抽屉里012---In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
真的  不  异想天开  虚构的012---Really? No, freak show, she's fictional!
好啦  放轻松012---Come on! Hey. Take it easy.
如果对你那么重要  我…我会去找别的工作012---If it means that much to you, I'll, uh... I'll go find something else.
