谢谢你们能赶过来012---So thanks for coming by, guys.
我们希望你们能帮我们  想一些婚礼上用的点子012---We wanted to bounce some ideas off of you about the wedding ceremony.
好啊012---Oh.
怎么了  你还好吗  好啊  只是因为012---What's the matter? Are you okay? Yeah, it's just...
摩妮卡说了“婚礼”012---Monica said "wedding."
我们希望你们之中  有人能上台念些感性的文章012---Uh, so we wanted to know if one of you would like to read something during the ceremony.
好吧  我想我应该也能胜任012---Okay, yeah, I guess, I guess I can do that too.
也能胜任012---Too?
我自己想了一个点子  来庆祝你们的婚礼012---Yeah, I kind of, ahem, have something else planned for you guys.
你能告诉我们是什么点子吗   抱歉012---Do you mind telling us what it is? Sorry.
我想把它当成最高机密012---I'm kind of keeping this one on the QT.
不管你是指哪个  我希望会有眨眼睛012---Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我跟《我日》的编剧谈过012---So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today,
什么是《我日》 《我们的日子》012---What is DOOL? Days Of Our Lives.
你们一定不相信  我演的角色就要醒过来了012---Anyway, you're not gonna believe it. My character is coming out of his coma!
那真的是太棒了  哇  乔伊012---That's wonderful. Wow, Joey.
不只是那个  我会有个新脑子012---And not only that. I'm getting a new brain!
你的工作跟私生活  进步都好大啊012---So great things are happening at work and in your personal life.
你要换个新脑子012---What do you mean you're getting a new brain?
他们要踢走剧中一个角色012---They're killing off one of the characters, and when she dies...
将她的脑子移植到我的身体里012---...and her brain is being transplanted into my body.
什么  脑部移植手术012---Heh, what? A brain transplant?
这太可笑了012---It's ridiculous.
可笑的是你三个半月没有做过爱012---I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
现在是冬天  街上的人少了很多012---It's winter. There are fewer people on the street.
他们要踢走谁012---Who are they killing off?
西西雅梦露  她饰演洁西卡拉哈特012---Uh, Cecilia Monroe. She plays Jessica Lockhart.
不  不012---No! No!
她最擅长将饮料泼到别人的脸上012---She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces.
我从来没看过她喝完一杯饮料012---I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
还有她打人巴掌的样子  你不想那么做吗012---The way she slaps people. Wouldn't you love to do that?
别那么做012---Don't do it.
她参与这出戏的演出很久了012---And she's been on the show forever.
要代替她一定很难  是啊012---It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. Yeah.
那你得帮帮我  当你012---Help me out here. When you--
当你做过脑部移植手术后012---When you come out of the "brain transplant"...
你要变成她012---...you are going to be her?
对  她被困在德瑞克的身体里012---Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.
你为什么就是搞不懂  我还以为你是科学家012---Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist.
老友记  第七季  第15集  乔伊换脑012---Friends  S07E15  The One With Joey's New Brain
瑞秋  那边那个男的012---Rash, so that guy there:
是异性恋还是同性恋012---Straight or gay?
他太帅了  不可能是异性恋012---Oh, yeah, he's too cute to be straight. Ha, ha.
大波霸小姐会帮我们查个清楚012---Ooh, Knockers will help us figure it out.
好了  他是异性恋012---All right, straight.
而且一眼就看得出来012---And not subtle.
他忘了拿手机012---He left his cell phone. Oh?
我们得把它交给阿甘  放在失物招领处012---Oh, well, We could hand it to Gunther, he'll put it in lost and found.
或是用它打电话到中国  看看那些人在做什么012---Or we could use it to call China, see how those guys are doing.
如果他打电话来找手机  我接了电话012---What if, uh, he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it, and I answer...
我们开始聊天  之后坠入爱河呢012---...and we start talking and we fell in love?
那到是个很棒的故事012---I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
就像是数码时代的童话故事012---Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. Yeah.
听起来真棒  我要去拿手机012---That does sound great. I'm gonna get the phone.
什么  等一下  为什么你会成为故事的女主角012---What? Wait. Why do you get the story?
我不知道  我已经很久没有约会了012---I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
菲比  三天前你才约过会012---Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
那不是约会  那只是  朋友聚会  然后做爱012---That wasn't a date. That was, That was just friends getting together and having sex.
好吧  这样  我去拿手机012---Okay. Great. See, I get the phone.
不行  不行  一星期前你才跟泰格分手012---No way! No way! You just broke up with Tag a week ago.
对  直到现在  我才明白  我能再爱一次012---Yeah, and until now, I didn't think I would love again.
说的好  等一下012---Nice try. Hey, wait.
我们该怎么公平地决定  谁能拿走手机呢012---How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
我不知道012---I don't know.
要不012---Well, um...
或许我们可以012---Maybe we could, uh...
你动作太慢了012---Ah-ha! Too slow! Ha-ha-ha.
你太自信了012---Ah-ha! Too cocky.
我在跟他约会  你管不了012---I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
不  我管得了012---Yes, there is.
你打算怎么做  杀了他吗  就像你杀了查尔斯012---What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
我的宝贝012---Oh, my baby.
卡012---Cut!
你演得太好了  刚刚那一巴掌  很逼真  你怎么办到的012---That was a great scene. And that slap looked so real. How do you do that?
那只是多年的经验而已  快给我拿些冰块过来012---Oh, just years of experience. Can I get some ice here?
我只想说  我觉得你的演技很棒012---Anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
你该不会是  那个快死掉的影迷吧012---You're not the fan who's dying, are you?
不  我是乔伊崔比亚尼   昨天我们合拍过一场戏012---No. No, uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani. We did a scene together yesterday.
我就是那个昏迷的人  那是真人012---I'm the guy in the coma. Oh, that was a real person?
因为你离开后我要移植你的脑子012---An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say, since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show...
我在想如果  我要离开剧组012---...I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me... I'm leaving the show?
不知道  为什么  你听到什么了012---I don't know, why? Did you hear something?
是谁告诉你的012---Who told you that? Oh, uh...
编剧之一  哪个编剧  是秃头佬还是高个子012---Oh uh, One of the writers. Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
那个不重要   因为那不是真的012---You know, it doesn't matter, because it is not true.
好吧012---Okay. Whoo, eh.
如果那是真的  你竟然敢来叫我教你012---And if it were true, how dare you come to me and ask me for tips...
该如何饰演我演了二十年的角色012---...about a character I've been playing for 20 years! I'll give you a tip!
梦露小姐  好吧  你干的不错012---Miss Monroe-Oh, there you go.
好吧  听着  我有个点子012---Okay, look, I have an idea.
我们为什么不看看  他的快速拨键记录了哪些电话号码呢012---Why don't we, Why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial'?
跟他有最多共通点的人012---And then from that, we can tell who has more in common with him...
就可以把手机拿走012---...and whoever does gets the phone.
行  好吧  好吧012---Fine. All right. All right.
速拨键的第一个名字是 "妈妈"012---First name on the speed dial is "Mom." Oh.
喔  我妈妈自杀死了012---I lost my mom to suicide.
不行012---Okay, no way.
你不能利用那一点  抢走帅哥跟最后一块蓝莓松饼012---You can't use that to get the cute guy and the last muffin.
今天我已经用过那个借口了  对不起012---Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
班  卡洛斯  大卫012---"Ben, Carlos, David--"
我赢了  他在速拨键里记下了巴尼斯012---Oh, I win. He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
你不知道  他指的是不是巴尼斯服饰店012---So? You don't know that it's Barney's the store.
那可能是他朋友家或是酒吧的电话012---That could be y'know his friend's house, or a bar, or--
谁会把巴尼斯服饰店的电话  记录成快速拨键呢012---Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
他的新女朋友012---His new girlfriend.
那是什么声音012---What is that?
我想是快死掉的猫在举行游行012---I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.
听起来是从对街传来的012---Sounds like it's coming from across the street.
我的天啊  什么012---Oh, my God. What?
还记得罗斯说过  他要在婚礼上给我们惊喜吗012---Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?
他跟我出去混时说  "你有苏格兰的血统吧"012---He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish, right?"
不  不可能  不可能是罗斯012---No. There is no way. It cannot be Ross.
不可思议  为什么你有苏格兰血统012---Unbelievable. Why is your family Scottish?
为什么罗斯是你哥哥012---Why is your family Ross?
他不能在婚礼上演奏  大家都会跑光的012---He cannot play at our wedding. I mean everyone will leave.
别这样  那只是噪音012---I mean, come on. That is just noise!
那根本不算是歌012---It's not even a song.
等一下  如果你仔细听012---Wait. If you listen very carefully, I think...
我想它是库尔  与伙伴合唱团唱的《庆祝》012---...it's "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang.
你说的对  他们是要将我踢出这出戏012---You're absolutely right. They are writing me out of the show.
他们还没有决定  什么时候  但应该很快012---They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently it's soon...
就是这样了012---...and then that's it.
我真的很抱歉  如果我可以决定  你永远都不会离开这出戏012---I'm sorry. If it was up to me, you would never leave the show.
谢谢你  我是认真的012---Yeah, thanks. No, I mean it.
我不敢相信他们会对你这么做  还有你的影迷012---I can't believe they'd do this to you. And to your fans.
他们一定会崩溃伤心  他们是那么地爱你012---They're gonna be devastated. Heartbroken. They love you so much.
你说的对012---Oh, you're right.
谢谢012---Thank you.
你说你叫什么名字012---What's your name again? Uh
乔伊  谢谢你012---Joey. Joey. Well, thank you.
你真的太贴心了012---That is so sweet. Oh.
听着  之前我来找你012---The-The only reason that I, that I came up to you before...
是因为012---...was because, well...
因为要饰演你我真的很紧张012---...because I'm really nervous about being you.
请你帮我抓住角色的精髓012---You know, if you could help me capture the essence of the character.
帮助我让洁西卡  继续活下去  可以吗012---Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
好吧  乔伊  我会帮你012---All right, Joey, I will help you.
不是因为我对这出蠢戏有亏欠012---Not because I owe it to this stupid show...
而是因为我亏欠洁西卡012---...but because I owe it to Jessica.
真的是太棒了  谢谢你  别客气012---Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. You're so welcome.
我一直在观摩录影带  你觉得这招如何012---I've been watching some tapes. How's this?
洁西卡拉哈特  永远都不会再踏入这里012---Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!
永远都不会012---Ever!
但洁西卡没有英国腔012---Oh, but, Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
我有英国腔012---I can do an English accent?
我要把这点写在我的履历表里012---That baby's going on my resume.
嗨  你好吗   我很好012---Hi, Pheebs. How are you? Good.
还记得我们在咖啡厅012---Um, Phoebe, remember when we were in the coffeehouse...
我们决定我可以  拿走那个帅哥的手机吗012---...we decided I was gonna keep the cute guy's phone?
记得啊  我把它放在我的皮包里012---Yeah. And remember how I said I was gonna keep it in my purse...
如果它响了  我就能立刻接听012---...so that if it rang, I could just pick it up? Yeah.
你还记得你从我的皮包  把手机偷走了吗012---And then do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?
我听不懂你在说什么012---Ooh, now you lost me.
你偷走了手机  不  我没有012---You stole the phone. No, I didn't.
没有  如果我拨号过去  它会不会响呢012---No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
不会  好吧012---No. Hmm. Okay.
既然你要拨号了  我要让你看看  我刚买的响铃皮包012---Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.
喔  它真的响了012---Oh, it does work.
菲比  那是另一只手机012---Phoebe. That is a different phone.
是吗  喂  对  你好  瑞秋在吗012---Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi. ls Rachel there?
她在  请稍等  是找我的012---Yes, she is. Just one moment, please. It's for me!
那是铁证012---That is damning evidence. Ugh.
我的天啊  我敢说是他打来的012---Oh, my God. I bet that's him.
我的数码童话故事就要开始了012---My digital fairy tale's about to begin.
你真是012---It's ri--
你能不能别再那么做了012---Would you stop doing that?
喂  对  我就是捡到你手机的人012---Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
菲比  你不能  我在打电话012---Phoebe, you can't do th-Shh, I'm on a call.
对  今晚你能过来拿  就八点半吧012---Well, yeah, I mean, you could pick it up tonight. Say, 8:30?
到我家来012---At my apartment. It's, um--
摩顿街五号  十四号房012---It's, um, 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.
或许之后我们可以去吃点东西012---And then maybe, you know, after, we could grab a bite to eat or whatever.
好的  到时候见  再见012---Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.
你知道他来的时候我会在这里012---You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
你怎么知道他什么时候会来012---Oh, and how will you know what time to come over?
你刚刚说出来了012---You just said it.
这个角色的精髓源自于她的自信012---Joey, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.
譬如说  当洁西卡走进一个房间时012---So when Jessica enters a room, for instance...
她拥有那个房间里012---...she owns everything...
所有事物跟所有人012---...and every person in that room.
你来试试看  好吧012---You try it. Okay.
他没有对这个房间生气012---Right. Well, he's not mad at the room.
再试一次  他拥有它  他拥有这个房间012---Try it again. He owns it. He owns the room.
这是他的  他拥有  这个房间  他拥有它012---It is his. He owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!
这看着有点奇怪   但已经好多了012---It's a little weird, but it's getting better.
我一定会很想念这个女人  我不知道我该怎么办012---Oh, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
我演这出戏二十年了012---It's been 20 years of my life.
或许这是件好事012---Hey, hey. Maybe-Maybe, uh-Maybe this is a good thing.
它给你机会做改变   扮演不一样的角色012---You know? It'll give you a chance to shake things up. Play different characters.
你才华洋溢012---You're so talented.
或许我该在几年前离开   那时很多人找我接戏012---Probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in...
但我在这里过得太舒服了012---...but, you know, I just got so comfy here and...
我错失了很多大好的机会012---Ugh, I turned down some amazing work.
譬如说呢  喔012---Like what? Well...
就说如果我在十五年前离开012---...let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago...
现在的墨西哥影坛会完全不一样的012---...the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today.
哇012---Wow.
但现在现在时机不一样了012---But, well, now... Now's a different time for me.
嘿  别这样  别这样012---Oh, hey, come on. Don't, uh-Don't do this.
听我说句话  好吗012---Let me tell you something, okay?
当我看到你演戏时  我想 "天啊  她是个很棒的演员"012---Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."
但我也会想 "她好辣"012---But-But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."
你觉得我很辣012---You think I'm hot?
你拥有这个房间012---You own the room.
或许我们应该012---We-We should probably get the...
对  我们应该012---Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get--
当洁西卡吻男人时012---So when Jessica kisses a man...
她通常会把012---...she usually puts, um...
双手放在那个男人脸上012---...both her hands on the man's face.
我注意到了  那是因为她充满了热情吗012---Yeah, I notice that. Is that because she's so passionate?
不  那是因为  那样子摄影机只能拍到她012---No, it's because that way the camera only sees her.
你想试试看吗012---You want to try it?
好的012---Yeah, okay.
太棒了  真的很不错012---That was good. That was really good.
但我想你手的位置不对012---But I think that maybe your hands are just a little off.
它们应该  像这样012---They should be, maybe-Like, right-Mm.
我想吃一些点心012---Well, I feel like a snack.
你要吃点脆饼吗  它可是你故乡苏格兰的点心012---Do you want some shortbread? It's Scottish, like you are.
不  谢谢  我不喜欢苏格兰的东西012---Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything from my Scottish heritage.
什么012---What?
因为我的家族被赶出苏格兰012---Well, it's just that my entire family was run out of Scotland by...
是维京人干的012---...Vikings.
听起来你家人  准备要恢复苏格兰传统012---Oh well, it sounds to me like your family's ready to, uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
你不能在婚礼上吹风笛012---You can't play bagpipes at the wedding!
你们怎么知道012---How did you know about that?
我们听到你在家里吹风笛012---We heard you play all the way from your apartment.
是你们去报警的012---Were you the ones who called the cops?
现在那个真的不重要了012---That's not really important right now. Ahem.
重要的是  我们谢谢你的好意012---What is important is, while we appreciate the gesture...
我们只是觉得  我们的婚礼上不适合吹风笛012---...we just don't feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
为什么   因为我们讨厌风笛012---Why not? Because we hate them.
给我机会为你们表演  再做最后的决定012---Just give me a chance to perform for you, and then decide whatever you want.
我也不会告诉你们  我要吹哪首曲子012---I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play, either. But, uh...
就说当表演结束后012---...let's just say when it's over...
我们一定会庆祝一下012---...I'll bet there'll be a wee bit 0' celebration.
嘿  嘿012---Hey, hey!
是谁012---Who is it?
我是汤姆012---Hi, It's Tom.
我来拿手机的012---I'm hereto pick up the phone. Ah!
为什么要你去开门012---Whoa, why do you get to answer the door?
为什么不行   因为这里是我家012---Why shouldn't I? Because it's my apartment.
那么由我来把手机交给他012---Well, then I get to give him the phone.
好吧  希望你能好好  跟他解释那些打到中国的电话012---Okay. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
嗨012---Hi.
我们争执了多久012---Wow, how long were we arguing for?
你不是那个忘了拿手机的人012---You're not the man who left the cell phone.
对  他是我的助理  他会来吗012---No, that's my assistant. Is he coming?
不会012---Um, no.
你能让我们谈一下吗012---Could you, uh, give us one second?
没问题  我们马上回来012---Sure. We'll be right back, sir.
我们该怎么办   我不知道012---Well, what do we do? I don't know.
你能相信吗012---Can you believe this?
我们在等一个帅哥  结果来了一个超级大帅哥012---We were waiting for a hot guy and an even hotter one shows up.
我知道012---I know--
什么012---What?
瑞秋  听我说012---Rachel, listen...
如果你能把他让给我  我真的欠你一个大人情012---...if you let me have him, then I will really owe you one.
好吧012---All right.
好吧  菲比  我把他让给你012---All right, All right Phoebe, I will let you have him.
但你欠我一个大人情012---But you owe me. You owe me big.
哪一位漂亮的小姐要陪我去吃晚餐012---So which one of you lovely ladies am I gonna take to dinner, huh?
是我012---Oh, that'd be me, sir.
你先走  谢谢012---After you. Okay, thank you.
太棒了012---Nice.
你的确拥有那个房间012---Well, you certainly own that room.
事实上  我租下了整间公寓012---Actually, I rent the whole place.
我刚了解你的意思了  谢谢夸奖012---And I just got what you meant. Thank you.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
洁西卡拉哈特在我家里面012---Aah! Jessica Lockhart! In my apartment!
我是你的头号大影迷   我是你的头号大影迷012---I am such a huge fan. I am such a huge fan.
很高兴能知道012---Well, it's nice to know that--
摩妮卡  摩妮卡012---Monica! Monica!
她是我的室友瑞秋012---That, uh-That's my roommate, Rachel.
难怪你家里会有女人内衣012---Oh, that explains all the women's underwear.
没错012---Sure. Yeah.
我的天啊  是真的012---Oh, my God, it's true!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我能请你帮我一个忙吗012---Can I just ask you to do me-Aw. just one favor?
当然可以012---Certainly.
