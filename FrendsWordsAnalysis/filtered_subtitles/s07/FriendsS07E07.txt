早安   嗨012---Morning. Hi.
昨晚约会还顺利吗012---Hi! Oh, How was your date last night?
很不错  太好了012---Pretty good. Oh, good.
天啊  我真的很抱歉012---Aah! My God. Sorry about that.
没事  真的是太棒了012---Okay, really good.
我得走了  我要迟到了012---Anyway I gotta go. I'm late for work.
什么啊  你要把她丢给我012---What-what?! You're going to leave this person with me?
别担心  她真的很棒012---Hey, Don't worry, she's a terrific girl.
你能帮我一个忙吗012---And hey listen, could you do me a favor?
她出来了  你能跟她说我不想定下来吗   谢谢你啊012---When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship? That'd be great.
什么  你在开玩笑吗012---Why?! What, are you kidding?
不经意跟她提起这件事  装做轻描淡写的样子012---Just casually slip it in, you know. Lay the groundwork.
告诉她我是个独行侠  不  我是爱的逃犯012---Tell her uh, I'm a loner. No, an outlaw.
她不会想跟我这种人混在一起012---she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
太复杂了012---Y'know what? That's a lot to remember.
我不能直接告诉她你是猪吗012---Can't I tell her that you're a pig?
我会找时间亲自打电话给她012---Hey, I'm gonna call her later myself.
我保证012---Honest.
钱德以前常这么做  他还会做煎饼给她吃012---Oh come on, Chandler used to do it. He'd even make the girl pancakes!
他还会多做几块留给我吃012---Plus, He'd make extras and leave them for me.
算了吧   我什么都不会告诉她   这不是我的责任012---Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. It's not my responsibility.
好吧012---Fine.
那些煎饼怎么办啊012---Now, where did we land on those pancakes?
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
抱歉   我没办法把门锁上012---Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
没关系  我搬进来时  乔伊就把它弄坏了012---Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it when I moved in.
你一定是瑞秋  我是艾玲  嗨012---You must be Rachel. I'm Erin. Hi.
我不想跟高中女生一样无聊   但他有跟你谈到我吗012---I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
你要吃煎饼吗012---Would you like some pancakes?
老友记   第七季  第7集  罗斯的博士论文012---Friends  S07E07  The One With Ross's Book
快说吧  我们为什么要来这里   好吧  猜下012---Come on. Why are we here? Okay, okay, take a guess.
这里有辣妹012---The hot chicks?
好吧  之前我将一些名字输入图书馆的电脑里012---Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier...
你知道的  当时只是为了好玩012---...you know, for fun.
我输入我的名字   你猜我发现了什么012---And I typed mine in, and guess what came up?
我的博士论文012---My doctoral dissertation.
它就放在大学中最大的图书馆里012---It's here! Yeah, It's right down here in the biggest library in the university.
哇  那真的很酷  对012---Wow, that's actually pretty cool. yes.
这里还收藏了一本书   作者是叫做温蒂巴琴娜的女人012---There's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.
那是怎么一回事012---What is that?
看起来这两个家伙   真的很喜欢杜威十进分类法012---Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
我们真的很抱歉012---We're so sorry.
你该不会是带我来这里做那档子事吧012---You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
她又把鸡肉退回来了012---She sent the chicken back again?
她说鸡肉太干  想亲自跟你解释  她要什么样的鸡肉012---She said it's too dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you how she wants it.
我倒想会会这个鸡肉专家012---Well fine! I'd like to meet this chicken expert.
叫她进来吧012---Send the colonel in.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
幸运的混蛋012---Lucky bastard.

高级大餐厅里   处理上等鸡肉的辣妹大厨师012---...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?
我很好012---I'm fine.
你手上戴了什么   我看不见了012---Oh, what is that on your finger? I'm blind.
谁是那个幸运的男人012---So who's the lucky guy?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我真的很抱歉   甜心012---I am so sorry, sweetie.
你没事吧012---Are you okay?
你没有告诉她  我们将会结婚吧012---You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
她看到戒指了  她被吓到了吗012---She saw the ring. Did she freak out?
她的确被吓了一大跳   但很多人都吓了一大跳012---She was shocked when I told her, but then again, so were most people.
肯定啊012---Right
事实上她也交了男朋友012---Well, She actually has a boyfriend y'know herself.
他叫做克拉克012---Name's Clark.
她还邀请自己来参加我们的婚礼012---She also invited herself to our wedding.
还有克拉克012---Clark too.
你拒绝了她吧012---You said no, right?
你拒绝了她吧012---You said no, right?
她逼得我头晕  还质问我  婚礼是不是在城里举行012---Well, she cornered me. She asked me if the wedding was in town.
我该怎么办   说谎骗她012---I mean, What was I supposed to do? Lie.
那会有多难呢  "你的支票寄出去了"012---How hard is that? "Your check's in the mail."
"你的宝宝好可爱"012---"Oh, your baby's so cute."
"我等不及要看你的书  罗斯"012---"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."
她会来参加婚礼  或许并不是件坏事012---Come on! So she comes to the wedding. Maybe it won't be so bad.
你以为她会安静地坐着   你不认为她会想举杯致词吗012---What do you think she'll sit quietly? You don't think she'll want to make a toast?
你不认为她会想唱 《兼职情人》吧012---You don't think she'll want to grab the microphone and sing "Part-Time Lover"?
我的天啊   她不会喜欢鸡肉  对吧012---Oh, my God. She's not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?
你知道吗  一定会没事的012---You know what? It'll be okay.
或许她根本不想来012---Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
真的吗   不   那是个谎言012---Really? No, that was a lie.
你知道说谎有多容易了吧012---See how easy that was?
所以你会骗她吗012---So you would have just lied?
我会012---Yes.
它真的就那么简单   对012---It would have really been that easy? Yes.
很好  那星期六表演给我看  我们要跟她和克拉克共进晚餐012---Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
你们还好吗012---Hey, what's up?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿   你的朋友是谁啊012---Hey, who's your friend?
嘿012---Hey!

你还在这里012---You're still here.
我们整天泡在一起   玩得很开心012---Yeah, We ended up spending the day together and had such a great time.
那当然   艾玲真的很棒012---Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.
你们也是012---And then there's you guys.
听着  我得走了012---Well, listen, I better get going.
今天真的很愉快   谢谢  我知道012---Today was great. Thanks. I know.
好吧012---0Kay.

很高兴能再见到你  拜012---Good to see you again. Bye.
再见  再见012---Bye-bye. Bye.
那套系统已经崩溃了012---So the system kind of broke down, huh?
乔伊  对不起  我没办法告诉她那些话012---Oh Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her.
我们开始聊起天来  我012---And y'know we got to talking, and I--
我们要你娶她012---We want you to marry her.
什么012---What?
她真的很棒   你根本不了解她012---She is so amazing. You have no idea.
不了解   你觉得是谁把她带回来的012---No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
丘比特012---Cupid.
她真的好酷   还会说四种语言012---Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
天啊   你们真的知道男人想要什么012---Man, do you know what guys want.
别这样   她跟你是天生的一对   她真的很漂亮012---Look Joey, Come on, she's so perfect for you. I mean She's sweet.
她喜欢棒球   午餐时喝了两瓶啤酒012---She likes baseball. She had two beers at lunch.
我的啤酒012---My beers?!
听着   她真的是个好女孩012---Look you guys, she's a very nice girl.
我们相处甚欢   但我不觉得我们会有什么结局012---Okay. We had a very good time, but I just I don't see it going anywhere.
你总是那么说012---Yeah, but you always say that.
或许只要你给她一次机会   事情就会变得不一样012---Maybe if you gave this girl a chance, it would go somewhere.
对不起  我真的不那么认为012---Look I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so.
随便你  好吧012---Whatever. Fine.
嘿  别开始评论我012---Hey, don't start judging me.
你爱上了你的助理012---You're the one who's in love with your assistant.
还有你  你跟在屋顶上养鸽子的男人有一腿012---Huh? And you, You're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps pigeons on the roof.
菲比012---Phoebe!
那是秘密恋情012---Secret affair.
大家在我的书面前做那档子事012---People are doing it in front of my book.
你说什么012---I'm sorry?
学校图书馆收藏了我的博士论文   我跑过去看012---My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school. I went to see it.
发现学生们在古生物学区 "做那档子事"012---And there were students making babies right in the middle of the paleontology section.
我的天啊   你有看到精彩好戏吗012---Oh, my God. Did you get to see anything good?
我问问  你们念书的时候012---Let me ask you something, at your school...
校园里有没有什么地方  是学生会跑去鬼混的012---...was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to fool around?
没错  真的有012---Yeah, there was.
图书馆的角落里  有些书根本不会有人去借012---It was—there the corner of the library where all these dusty books that nobody ever read.
没错  是那里012---Yes, there was.
太棒了  因为大家都会跑到那里去  像是秘密基地一样012---Great, because people kept showing up. I think it's like a thing.
等一下012---Hold on a second.
你是指五楼后区的墙边吗012---Fifth floor, against that back wall?
我的老天爷啊012---Oh, for crying out loud!
我们该去看电影了  干嘛这么急012---All right, So we should go catch our movie. Well now what's the rush?

我们正要去看电影012---We were  just about to take off and see a movie.
喔  不  怎么了012---Oh, no! What's wrong?
菲比  我们忘了  我们得去参加派对012---Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
喔  不会吧012---Oh, no.
什么派对012---What party?
生日派对012---A birthday party.
谁的生日派对012---Whose birthday party?
爱莉森的生日派对012---Alison's birthday party.
爱莉森几岁了012---Oh. And how old is Alison?
三十二岁012---Thirty-two.
等一下   你们为什么不一起出去玩呢012---Wait a minute. Why don't you guys do something?
这一招还真的有用012---Yeah, Look how that worked out.
对不起  我是学校里的教授012---Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.
你知道五楼437号书架的古生物学区吗012---Do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
我知道  等我五分钟012---Well, yes. Just give me five minutes.
我得找人来帮我代班012---I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
不  不  不012---No, no, no.
我能跟负责人谈一谈吗012---Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
有什么事吗012---How can I help you?
你好  我想问馆方能不能增加人手012---Hi, I was wondering, if it is possible to increase security...
巡逻古生物学区012---...in the paleontology section?
我写的书放在那里012---I wrote a book that's up there.
但大家去那里不是看书  而是012---And instead of reading it, people are...
他们在我的书面前打滚012---Well, they're rolling around in front of it.
我们知道你提及的问题012---We are aware of the problem you're referring to.
但增加巡逻这件事   恐怕馆方的人力不足012---But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library's very understaffed.
我帮不上你的忙012---I can't help you.
好吧012---Well, fine.
如果我是唯一愿意欣赏012---If I'm the only person with any appreciation...
书写文字之美的人  我会亲自去捍卫它012---...of the sanctity of the written word, then I'll go up there and defend it myself.
别跟着我012---Don't you follow me.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你跟艾玲玩得还开心吗   真是不可思议012---How did it go with Erin? Unbelievable.
我们玩得非常开心012---We had the best time.
那你不再生我们的气了  不  你们是对的012---Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore? No, no. You guys were totally right.
这次比我们第一次约会棒得多012---This is so much better than the first time we went out.
第一次真的很尴尬   我们都很紧张012---Y'know? That was so awkward, We were both nervous.
你们不是上过床了  对  那倒是让我冷静了下来012---Didn't you sleep together? Yeah, that really calms me down.
我们有很多共通点012---And we have so much in common.
她喜欢三明治  运动  虽然她是大都会队的球迷012---She loves sandwiches, sports. Although she is a Met fan.
现在那都不是问题   但如果我们有了孩子012---not much of an issue now, but if we had kids...
我的天啊  你竟然会提到生孩子的事012---Oh, my God! Listen to you talking about having kids.
喔  我的乔伊012---Oh, my Joey.
求求你别比我先结婚012---Please don't get married before I do. Oh.
我不敢相信克拉克会放我鸽子012---I just cannot believe that Clark stood me up.
他可能还是会来012---He may still show up.
你是笨蛋吗012---What are you, stupid?
我们已经等了三小时  只有三小时吗012---It's been three hours. Is that all?
谈一些比较快乐的事吧012---Let's go on to happier things. okay?
为什么不告诉我你们的婚礼呢012---Why don't you tell me about your lovely wedding?
关于我们的婚礼  有一件事我们想告诉你012---Well actually uh, there was something that we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
婚礼的规模很小012---It's going to be a small ceremony.
小到不行012---Uh, Tiny.
我们甚至不知道为什么要举行婚礼012---We're not even sure why we're having it.
事实上我们只会邀请了家人来参加012---It's actually we wants to be just family.
喔   等一下012---Oh, wait.
你们把我当家人看待012---You two think of me as family?
我得问你们一件事   请老实地回答我012---Oh,  I have to ask you something now, and be honest.
你们要我唱《无心呢喃》 还是《红衣女郎》012---Do you want me to sing "Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?
你怎么能那么说   大都会队也好不到哪里去012---How can you say that? The Mets have no closer.
班尼提兹呢   第一场比赛呢012---What about Benitez? What about game one of the Series?
你为什么不闭嘴   你才要闭嘴012---What about shut up? You shut up.
我喜欢跟她吵架012---I love arguing with her.
我马上回来  好012---Be right back. Okay.
你跟乔伊进行得如何012---So how's it going with Joey?

还好012---Okay?
请告诉我你喜欢他   告诉我你真的喜欢他012---Wait okay, tell me that you like him, please. I mean, tell me that you like him.
他真的很棒  我知道  你们希望我们能成功012---Look, he's a really great guy, and I know you really want this to work out...
但我不觉得我们会有未来012---...but I just don't see this having a future.
但你说过你喜欢他   发生了什么事012---But you said that you liked him. I mean what happened?
你改变主意了吗012---Did you just change your mind?
可以那么说   那么快改回来啊012---Kind of. Then change it back!
对不起  我们之间真的没有火花012---I'm sorry. It's just there's no real spark.
没有火花   你们不是都上过床了吗012---No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
是啊012---Yeah.
荡妇012---Ugh, tramp!
乔伊知道吗012---Does Joey have any idea?
我想他不知道   你知道吗012---I really I don't think he does. And you know what?
或许你们可以告诉他  我不想012---Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm not interested...
认真地跟别人交往012---...in a serious relationship or something.
你是说你是个独行侠012---You mean, like, that you're kind of a loner?
对  那个说法不错012---Yeah, that'd be great.
或许你真的是个淫娃   你说什么012---And maybe that you're a real stronzo. I'm sorry?
我猜你会说的四种语言里   不包括意大利语吧012---Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
嘿   要走了吗   对啊  我们走吧012---Hey. Want to go? Yeah, let's go.
待会见   再见012---Okay. See you guys later. Bye, guys.
嘿   谢谢你们012---Hey, thank you so much.
我猜不是丘比特把她带来这里的012---I guess it wasn't Cupid that brought her here.
不   只是一个会飞的老矮人012---No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
怎么了   需要我帮忙吗012---Yes, yes. How can I help you?
我们只是四处看看012---Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
原来你们是爱念书的学生012---Oh, you're-you're fellow scholars.
你们到底在找什么012---What exactly were you looking for?
或许你们想看012---Perhaps--
查斯特史塔克博士012---Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...
对剑齿虎的研究012---...on the Smilodon californicus?
快滚012---Get out of here!
你来找人吗012---Meeting someone?
还是你想来看看012---Or are you just here to brush up...
玛莉安对进化论的看法012---...on Merriam's views on evolution?
事实上  我觉得玛莉安的观点  太先进了012---Actually, I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
我也觉得玛莉安的观点太先进了012---I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
对不起  你是哪位012---I'm sorry. Who are you?
我是本校的教授罗斯盖勒012---I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.
罗斯盖勒   为什么那个名字好熟  它是012---Ross Geller? Why do I know that name? It's a...

这本书是你写的吗012---Did you write this?
对012---Yes.
你就是借走我的书的人012---You're the person who checked out my book?
你跟我想像中完全不一样012---You know, you look nothing like I would have thought.
你好年轻012---You're so young.
我四年级跳级了012---Well, I skipped fourth grade.

还去了冰淇淋店  一起喝一杯奶昔012---We went to this ice cream place. Split a milk shake.
我喝的比较多   但还是很棒012---Seventy-thirty, but still.
我想带她到北区的民宿去过一夜012---And guess what, I'm thinking of taking her upstate to one of those bed-and-breakfasts.
真的吗  她答应了吗012---Really? She said she wants to go away with you?
不  那只是个惊喜  但那有点难  因为她说她的工作实在很忙012---No-no-no-no-no! it's a surprise. but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
好吧  甜心  乔伊  我们得谈一谈  好吗012---Joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay?
今天她让我觉得012---I got the feeling from her today...
她不想认真地跟别人交往012---...that she's not looking for a serious relationship.
你怎么会那么想   是她告诉我的012---Where are you getting this? She told me.
她说她是个独行侠012---She said she's kind of a loner.
这样012---Oh.
乔伊   嘿   瑞秋  没关系的012---Joey-Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.
我也是个独行侠  对吧012---I'm a loner too, right?
乔伊   你知道吗   她配不上你012---Hey, Joey. You know what? You are way too good for her.
我发誓下次我会告诉她们   你不想定下来012---Yeah and honey I promise, next time I will just say good-bye and tell them you're not looking for a relationship.
不012---No.
不   别那么做   只要012---No, don't do that. Just...
下次确定她真的喜欢我   对   你说得没错012---Next time, make sure she really likes me. Well, that too.
乔伊012---Joey?
怎样012---Yeah?
你要吃煎饼吗   终于问我了012---Do you want some pancakes? Finally.
我们该怎么办012---What are we gonna do?
我们该选《无心呢喃》012---I say we go with "Careless Whisper."
钱德012---Chandler?
她看到我们了吗  看到我们了吗012---Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
珍妮丝   你来干什么012---Janice, what are you doing here?
我想回我家去012---I thought I was gonna go back to my apartment...
但今晚我不想独处012---...but then I just felt like I really couldn't be alone tonight.
我在想或许我可以待在你们家012---I was just wondering if I could maybe stay here with you.
我真的觉得我该跟家人在一起012---Just I really feel like I need to be with family.
