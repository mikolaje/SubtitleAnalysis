嘿  谁要法国吐司  给我一点012---Hey. Who wants French toast? Oh, I'll have some.
我也要  牛奶和鸡蛋在冰箱里   谢谢012---Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge. Thanks.
怎么回事   甜心  不知道  我的手怪怪的012---Oh, what's the matter, honey? I don't know, My hand feels weird.
我猜因为  我已经订婚了012---I guess it's because I'm engaged.
什么时候会开始变得烦人了   已经开始了012---How long before it starts getting annoying? It starts?
开始计划婚礼吧012---Yeah, so let's actually get started on the wedding plans.
好  现在就开始012---Okay. Already?
有很多事要做   要想花012---Yeah, we got a lot to do. We gotta think about the flowers...
外烩  音乐012---...the caterers, the music...
我觉得音乐的安排   钱德  太多意见了012---Oh, I got some thoughts on the music... Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
给你良心的建议  你只需要出现  说对名字就好了012---Take it from me. All you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
好012---0Kay.
那是什么  老天  是婚礼计划书012---What in God's name is that? Oh, my God, the wedding book?
四年级后我就没看到它了012---I haven't seen that since the 4th grade.
这里面什么都有  比如说  地点012---This baby has got everything. Take, you know, locations for instance:
先以字母顺序排列   再以地理位置排列012---First organized alphabetically, then geographically...
然后以大小排列012---...then by square footage.
好聪明012---That is so smart. Ha.
快溜   快溜   就趁现在012---Break it off. Ahem. Break it off, now.
老友记   第七季  第2集  瑞秋的色情小说012---Friends  S07E02  The One With Rachel's Book
所以以上证明了012---And that should conclusively prove...
《侏罗纪公园》是我先想到的012---...that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first.
我们来看看  罗斯012---Now, let's take a look-Hey, Ross.
菲比  我的天啊  你来干什么012---Phoebe, oh, my God, what are you doing here?
我有事和你说  很紧急  有关摩妮卡和钱德012---I need to talk to you. It's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
我的天   当然012---Oh, my God. Um, of course.
等我一下012---Uh, would you please excuse me for a moment?
你们知道彼此从哪儿来的吗   何不012---Um, heh, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you...?
怎么回事012---What's going on?
没什么  我在想  既然他们刚订婚012---Well, urn, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged...
应该多给他们一些独处的时间012---...that maybe it'd be nice if they had some privacy.y'know?
所以   我可以搬到你家待几天吗012---So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
好  当然可以  摩妮卡和钱德发生了什么事吗012---Okay, yeah, sure. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
没事  怎么了012---Nothing. Why?
菲比  是你说很紧急的012---Phoebe, you said it was urgent.
是啊  我的电影5分钟后要开演了012---Oh, yeah, it is. I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
你知道  我有一屋子的学生在这儿吗012---Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
抱歉  我没礼貌  有人想要一起去看电影吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
我还没和我爸妈谈到预算012---I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet...
不过可以跟我说音乐部分的安排012---...but tell me how this is for music.
这样好不好  行进时用弦乐四重奏  鸡尾酒会时安排爵士三重奏012---All right, urn, a string quartet for the processional, a jazz trio for cocktails...
跳舞时用湾市摇滚012---...the Bay City Rollers for dancing...
等一下  那是我的六年级婚礼012---Wait, that was for my 6th grade wedding.
也不可能用他们  伊恩不演出了  德苗克012---Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek...
我不该知道德苗克这个人的012---Well, Derek is a name I shouldn't know.
摩妮卡  有没有别的枕头  比较舒服一点的012---Hey, Mon, do you have another pillow, you know, something a little snugglier?
你为什么不回你家去   却要在这里睡012---Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
因为鸭子  什么  鸭子012---The duck. What, the duck?
怎么了   现在鸭子又做什么了012---What the hell did the damn duck do now?
它不是在那里生病的012---Uh, well, he did not get sick somewhere in there...
立刻就被发现了   而且处理干净了012---...and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up.
我可以看这本书吗012---Now, do I get to look at this book...
还是只有和婚礼相关人员可以看012---...or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
你当然可以看   我要你的意见012---Of course you can look at it. Yeah, I want your opinion too.
来012---Okay. Here you go.
桌子中间的花饰   花饰012---What do you think about centerpieces? Centerpieces.
玫瑰还是百合  当然是玫瑰了012---Roses or lilies? Definitely roses.
我觉得它们比较像婚礼的用花012---Well, I just think they're a bit more wedding-y, you know.
但是很清楚应该选百合  老天  简直就是心有灵犀012---But lilies are the clear choice. Oh, my God, it's like one mind.
各位  各位  让我休息好不好012---Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.
不然我会脾气不好012---I'm gonna get cranky.
乔伊  走廊对面的沙发很好的012---Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall.
是的  很不错012---Yes, it is perfectly good...
但那不是鸭子生病的地方之一012---...and it is not one of the places the duck got sick.
什么012---What?
好  我要走了  乔伊   鸭子到底做了什么012---All right, I'm gonna go. Joey, what did the duck do?
我不知道  但他没吃你的面霜012---I don't know, but he did not eat your face cream.
小朋友012---Hey, little buddy.
你觉得如何012---How you feeling? Aah.
那面霜里到底有什么012---What the hell is in that face cream?
好软012---That's so soft.
有枕头套啊012---Pillowcases.
嗯012---Oh, ah.
柔达看着扫烟囱的人  她的父亲是个传道者012---"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar--"
传道者012---Vicar?
还有好几小时才会回来012---"--wouldn't be home for hours.
她欲火中烧012---Her loins were burning.
她不顾一切伸出手去抓住他的012---She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his--"
哇012---Whoa.
哇012---Whoa.
这是色情小说012---This is a dirty book.
菲比012---Uh, Phoebe?
嗨  罗斯012---Oh, Ross, hi.
菲比  你在干什么  抱歉  我有客人在012---Phoebe, what are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
菲比  好吧  我们到外面谈012---Phoebe. Okay, let's talk outside.
菲比  你不能在我家帮别人按摩啊012---Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment.
有什么大不了的   我在摩妮卡和钱德家都可以012---What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's.
他们知道吗012---And they knew about it?
好吧   罗斯  到底怎么回事012---Okay, look, Ross, what is this really about?
这是我家   我希望能自由出入012---Look, this is my home, and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want.
好吧   我会找个其他地方  给我剩下的客人做的012---Okay. I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments.
我只是觉得   这有什么大不了的012---I just don't know what the big deal is.
大不了的地方就是  当我想回家拿一瓶拼图啤酒  冰啤酒放松时012---The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment...
我不要光着身子  身上油油的陌生人在我家里012---...when I want to kick back with a puzzle-Beer, cold beer.
嘿  乔伊  你好吗012---Hey, Joey. What are you doing?
扫地  怎么了  挑起你的性趣了吗012---Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on?
不会012---No.
如果我扫的是烟囱呢012---What if I was, uh, sweeping a chimney?
乔伊   你吃了我的面霜了吗012---Joey, did you eat my face cream?
你去哪儿  传道者还要几小时后才会回来012---Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
乔伊012---Joey...
你从哪儿学到那个词的012---...where did you learn that word?
你想是哪里012---Where do you think...
柔达012---...Zelda?
你看了我的书   对012---You found my book? Yeah, I did.
乔伊  你到我房里干什么012---Joey, what are you doing going into my bedroom?
抱歉  我只是小睡了一下012---Okay, I'm sorry. I went in there to take a nap.
我知道  我不应该看  可是你居然有色情小说012---And I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn.
知道吗  我不在乎  我不会感到有什么丢脸的012---Hey-hey, You know what? I don't care. I'm not ashamed of my book.
女人享受一点情色没什么不对啊012---There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica.
是女性性成熟的健康表现012---It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality...
那是你永远都不会理解的012---...which, by the way, is something that you will never understand.
你有色情小说012---You got porn.
你好  嗨   菲比在吗012---Hello. Hi, is, uh, Phoebe here?
不   不   今晚她不在  真是的012---Uh, no, no, she's out for the night. Oh, great.
可以帮你什么忙吗012---Heh. Can I help you with something?
我不知道   你是按摩师吗012---I don't know. Are you a masseur?
是   我是012---Yes, I am.
太好了  爸012---Great. Dad?
谢谢你   一小时后我来接他012---Thank you so much. I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
钱德  你父母听到你订婚的消息012---So, Chandler, your parents must've been thrilled...
一定会很开心的012---...when you told them you were engaged.
哦   是啊   我应该打电话给他们012---Oh, yeah. I should probably call them.
我记得我们刚订婚的时候012---I remember when we first got engaged.
我没听过这个故事  爸  你不必012---I don't think I've heard that story. Dad, really you don't--
是啊  我让茱蒂怀孕了012---Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.
我还是不知道怎么发生的012---I still don't know that happened.
你不知道怎么发生的  你的狗还以为我的避孕器是磨牙的玩具012---You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.
好感人的故事012---What a sweet story.
至少你不是在五年级的万圣节派对上听到的这故事012---At least you're not hearing it at your 5th grade Halloween party.
什么  他们要听吓人的故事012---What? They wanted a scary story.
提起婚礼计划  我们好兴奋啊012---Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans.
很快我们就要能从婚礼基金中提取一大笔钱了012---and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
什么  杰克  你告诉她  我做不到012---What? You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.
怎么了  我的婚礼基金还在   对吧012---What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund, don't you?
还在  只是现在叫做  "海滩别墅"012---We have it. Only now we call it "the beach house."
我不敢相信  你把我的婚礼基金花在了海滩别墅上012---I can't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house.
对不起  我们以为012---We're sorry honey, but we just assumed...
等你30岁后  你会自己付钱012---...if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
你们买海滩别墅时我才23岁012---You bought the beach house when I was 23.
那也就是   你在海边享受了7年好时光012---Which means you had seven years of beach fun...
那可是无价的012---...and you can't put a price on that, sweetie.
我们觉得很抱歉012---We really do feel bad about this though.
你和理查交往时   我们又开始存钱012---We started saving again when you dated Richard.
结果你们闹翻了  我们重新装修了厨房012---But then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
那我开始和钱德约会呢012---What about when I started dating Chandler?
我们以为钱德不会求婚012---Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose.
很显然  开始吃饭时   我的酒喝得不够012---Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. Heh.
我不相信   我结婚竟然没有钱了012---I can't believe there is no money for my wedding.
也许还有   如果你爸没有012---We might still have some if your father didn't think it was a good idea...
在网络上卖冰的话012---...to sell ice over the Internet.
那个主意看来很简单   只能用 "笨"来形容012---It seemed like such a simple idea. Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.
够了  我不想再听了012---All right, enough. I don't want to hear about it anymore.
祝你好运   钱德012---Good luck, Chandler.
现在我要012---Okay, now I'm going to...
碰你了012---...touch you.
好软啊012---Oh, that's soft.
我不敢相信   你认为你的父母可能帮忙付吗012---I can't believe this. Do you think your parents could help pay for it?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我妈大部分的钱   都花在她第四次的婚礼上了012---My mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
剩下的钱她离婚还要用012---She's saving the rest for her divorce.
而我爸存的钱用在到桃利屋的012---And any extra cash my father has, he saves for his yearly trips to...
年度旅行了012---...Dollywood.
你们的晚餐发生什么事了012---What happened at dinner?
我父母把婚礼基金花掉了012---My parents spent the money for our wedding.
我的天   你点了什么菜012---My God, what did you order?
等一下   没有婚礼基金了  太惨了012---Wait, there's no money? Well, this is terrible.
你们必须在活动中心结婚了012---You guys are gonna have to get married in, like, a rec center.
亲爱的  没关系的  不  有关系012---Honey, it's gonna be okay. No, it's not gonna be okay. It sucks.
没有乐团   没有百合   不   可那样很好啊012---No swing band, no lilies. No, you know what? It's gonna be okay.
你不需要有这种012---I mean, you don't need to have this...
意大利野宴012---...rustic Italian feast, you know?
你不需要这种订做的帝国式腰线  公主型丝缎礼服012---And you don't need this custom-made empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.
你可以买现成的礼服012---You can wear off-the-rack.
真的  不会有问题的012---Look, it really is gonna be okay.
重要的是我们彼此相爱   要结婚了012---The important thing is that we love each other and we're gonna get married.
你知不知道 "现成的"是什么意思012---Do you even understand what "off-the-rack" means?
你为什么不自己付钱呢012---Why don't you just pay for it yourself?
怎么付   我没钱啊012---How? I don't have any money.
我有啊   要多少012---Well, I have some. How much?
将近有012---Well, close to...
哇   你开玩笑   到底多少012---Whoa! Are you kidding me? What? How much?
够办婚礼计划A  真的012---It's enough for wedding scenario A. Really?
你真好  努力存钱的人012---How great are you, you little saver? Heh.
正是理想婚礼的预算012---The amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding.
喔   你们真是天造地设的一对012---Oh, you guys are so made for each other.
你不是要把所有的钱都花在婚礼上吧012---Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
是啊012---Uh,yeah.
我花了六年存到这些012---Well, I've been saving this money for six years...
有些是将来要用的  不是都花在一场派对上的012---...and I kind of have some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
哇   钱德先生   你好啊012---Wow. Hello, Mr. Chandler.
这是我们一生中最重要的一天012---this is the most special day of our lives.
我知道  甜心  但我不要把钱都花在一场派对上012---I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna spend all the money on one party.
甜心  我爱你012---Honey, um, I love you. Heh.
但如果你再叫我们的婚礼是一场派对的话012---But, urn, if you call our wedding a party one more time...
你将可能不会被邀请012---...you may not get invited.
钱可以再赚   但我们只结婚一次012---We can always earn more money, okay? But we're only gonna get married once.
我了解   但我是非常坚决地   我的答案是不012---Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down, okay? The answer is no.
你很坚决012---You're gonna have to put your foot down?
对  我是012---Yes, I am.
有钱和有一只坚定的手012---Wow. Money and a firm hand.
终于是我可以认同的钱德了012---Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
嘿   瑞秋   乔伊012---Hey,Rach. Joey.
瑞秋  有没有闻到烟味012---Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?
我懂了  烟   烟囱  扫烟囱的人   很好笑012---Uh-huh. I get it. Smoke, chimney, chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.
不  不  我说真的  你没闻到012---No, no, no, I'm serious. You don't smell it?
有东西着火了012---Something's on fire.
我没闻到什么012---No, I don't smell anything.
你知道吗  可能是你熊熊的欲火012---Oh, you know what? It's probably just your burning loins.
你们在讲什么啊   没什么012---Hey, what are you guys talking about? Nothing.
讨厌   咖啡冷了012---Mm, damn, this coffee's cold.
瑞秋  可以在你身上加温一下吗012---Hey, Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
乔伊   你竟然告诉他012---You know, I cannot believe you told him. Joey...
我猜你是在我们分手后买了那本书的012---So I guess you bought that book after we broke up, huh?
是啊   因为第一本  在我们交往时被翻烂了012---Uh-huh, I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
是吗012---Oh, yeah? Yeah?
我们交往时  我看了一大堆色情杂志012---Well, uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines.
怎么样012---What's up?
罗斯  你怎么可以那样对待一位老先生012---Ross, how could you do that to an old man?
失陪了  小姐们012---Excuse me, ladies.
什么啊012---I'm sorry?
我的按摩客人   亚瑟012---My massage client, Arthur.
他女儿说替我工作的一个人012---His daughter called and said some guy that worked for me...
今天下午替他做了个很奇怪的按摩012---...gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
我做了很专业的按摩012---I gave him an extremely professional massage.
他说你用木汤匙戳他012---He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
好吧   不是传统的按摩012---Okay, so it wasn't a traditional massage.
可是我用筷子替他刺激穴道012---But I did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks...
并且温和地用拖把去角质012---...and I gently exfoliated him with a mop.
他再也不会来了  你害的我一星期少进帐80元012---Well, he's never coming back, okay? You just cost me $80 a week.
这是你的错   你没更改约他的时间012---You know what? This is your fault. You didn't move his appointment.
我的错  你不必替他按摩的012---Oh, it's my fault? You didn't have to massage him.
你可以请他回去的012---You could've sent him away.
也你不必用玩具推土机   在他背上滚来滚去012---You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back.
他说他很喜欢012---He said he liked that.
你对  你对  对不起012---You're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
老兄  你干嘛按摩一位老先生012---Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
他女儿很辣   懂了012---His daughter was hot. Gotcha.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey
听着012---Listen, urn...
我想过了012---...I've been thinking.
要你把所有的钱   花在婚礼上很不公平012---And it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all your money on our wedding.
你辛苦赚来的012---I mean, you work really hard for that.
嗯  是你赚来的012---Well. Well, you work for that.
我也想过了012---Look, I thought about it too.
对不起   我们应该把所有的钱花在婚礼的012---And I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
真的  对  我很坚决的012---You do? Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.
我向你求婚时  我就告诉你了012---Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you...
我会尽力让你快乐012---...that I would do anything to make you happy.
如果办一场完美婚礼能让你开心012---And if having the perfect wedding makes you happy...
那我们就这么做012---...then that's what we're gonna do.
你对我真好012---You are so sweet.
不  等等012---Oh, but wait.
那我们  未来的生活该怎么办啊012---What about our--? What about the future and stuff?
管他的呢012---Ah, forget about the future and stuff.
我们只生两个就好012---So we only have two kids.
选一个我们最喜欢的   让他去念大学012---You know, we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
你真想过这些   对啊012---Have you thought about that? Yeah.
你本来要几个孩子012---How many kids were we gonna have?
四个  一个男孩  一对双胞胎女孩  再一个男孩012---Uh, four. A boy, twin girls and another boy.
你还想过什么012---What else did you think about?
还有我们要住的地方012---Well, heh, stuff like where we'd live, you know.
像是在市中心外的小房子012---y'know? Like a small place outside the city...
我们的小孩可以学骑单车012---...where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff.
可以买只猫咪   脖子上挂着铃铛012---Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar...
每次它跑出小门时   都听得见铃声012---...and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.
在车库上盖个房间   让乔伊终老012---Of course we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
你知道吗012---You know what?
我不要一个盛大的婚礼012---I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
你应该要的  不012---Sure you do. No.
我要你刚刚说的每一样东西   我要一个婚姻012---I want everything that you've just said. I want a marriage.
你确定012---You sure? Mm-hm.
我好爱你  我爱你012---I love you so much. I love you.
你刚说到将来的时候   你说喵咪012---Hey, listen, when you were talking about our future, you said cat.
实际上你指的是狗   对不对012---But you meant dog, right? Ha, ha.
对  好012---Ha, yeah, totally. Oh, good.
你好   柔达012---Hello, Zelda.
你又是谁呢   传道者012---Who are you supposed to be? The vicar.
你知道传道者是什么吗  像是个守门员  对不对012---Do you even know what a vicar is? Like a goalie, right?
对012---Yeah.
乔伊   我是说真的   够了012---Look, Joey, it's enough, all right?
你老是开这些很蠢的玩笑   还有无聊的暗讽012---You keep making these stupid jokes and these sleazy innuendoes...
真的是不好笑啊012---...and it's just not funny anymore.
对不起   瑞秋  对不起012---All right, I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
也许我可以在谷仓里  粗暴地对持你  来补偿你012---Maybe I could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn.
好了   够了  你想做吗  我们来做吧012---All right, you know what? That's it. You want to do it? Let's do it.

我一直想抗拒  但你说的每一句话  都深深打动了我012---Been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
我有吗012---Uh, I did?
有  我想得到你的身体想了好久了012---Yeah, oh, I've been waiting so long to get on that body.
我的身体   对  没错012---This body? Yeah, that's right.
乔伊   放马过来吧012---Come on, Joey, sex me up.
你听起来开始像第七章里的屠夫妻子012---Hey, you're starting to sound like the butcher's wife there in chapter seven.
来吧  不要让我等了   脱掉你的衣服012---Oh, come on, now. Don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off.
但留着你的头盔   因为这会是一场狂风暴雨012---But I would keep that helmet on, because you're in for a rough ride.
我不要  我好害怕012---I don't want to. I'm scared.
