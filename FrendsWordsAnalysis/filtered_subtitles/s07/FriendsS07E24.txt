我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我知道  摩妮卡怀孕了012---I know. Monica's gonna have a baby.
这能算是她的 "新经验" 吗012---Hey, can this count as her "something new"?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
嘿  你觉得这就是钱德逃婚的原因吗012---Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
不是  她应该是刚刚才验的孕  我昨晚倒过垃圾012---No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
这将会是有史以来最糟糕的一场婚礼012---Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever!
新娘怀孕  新郎逃婚  我还拿着这个012---The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing and I'm still holding this.
菲比  我们不能告诉任何人这件事012---Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.
对  没错  好吗012---Right. Okay? Yeah. Okay?
嘿  等一下  你知道  她用哪种方法避孕吗012---Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was uses?
不知道  怎么了012---No. Why?
将来会是个很好的广告啊012---Just for the future. This is hardly a commercial for it.
老友记  第七季  第24集  摩妮卡和钱德的婚礼(下集)012---Friends  S07E24  The One With Chandler and Monica's Wedding
有什么消息吗012---Anything?
没有  我跟在片场的乔伊谈过  他也没有他的消息012---No. I talked to Joey on the set, He hasn't heard from him.
我又去问了钱德的父母012---I talked to Chandler's parents again.
你跟她们说他失踪了  没有012---You told them he was missing? No.
我装作打电话过去跟他们聊天012---I made it seemed like I was just calling to chat.
我很确定她们两个  都以为我对她们有兴趣012---Pretty sure they both think I'm interested in them.
我们得告诉她他失踪了  不  不  我们不能那么做012---All right, we've got to tell her he's gone. No, Hey! Hey! we can't.
罗斯  她很快就会开始做准备了012---Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon.
你能拖延一下她吗  我会把昨晚找过的地方再找一遍012---Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
需要多少时间012---All right, well how much time do you need?
她最晚要什么时候开始准备012---Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
顶多1个小时  给我两个小时012---One hour. Give me two.
那你干嘛问我012---Then why do you ask?
祝我好运  我跟你一起去012---Okay, wish me luck. Okay. I'm going with you.
为什么012---Why?
罗斯  你累了  你找了一夜了  很明显你不擅长找人012---Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly, you suck at this.
待会见012---All right, I'll see you guys later.
你知道该怎么拖延她吗012---Okay. Wait, do you know how you're gonna to stall her?
我会想出办法的  好吧  祝你好运012---I'll figure something out. Okay, good luck.
嘿  我想我们得先开始化妆  然后再弄头发012---Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my makeup and then do my hair.
好吧  但你开始准备前  我想和你谈谈012---Okay. But before you do that, I need you to talk to me.
谈什么012---About what?
我永远都没办法结婚了012---I'm never gonna getting married!
你会的  你的真命天子快出现了012---Yeah you will. The right guy's just around the corner.
好吧  我们谈完了吗012---Okay, are we done with that?
不  我是认真的012---No Monica! I'm serious.
也许我该忘了这些  当个女同性恋或什么的012---Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
跟你在一起的女人  真是个幸运儿012---Any woman would be lucky to have you.
或许我跟乔伊上床   会感觉好受一些012---Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
瑞秋  你没事吧012---Rachel? You okay?
对不起  艾朗  我对计划通告表有点意见012---Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedule.
今天本来没有我的戏   我必须要去参加一个婚礼012---Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today. and I have this wedding that I really have to be at.
我最好的朋友要结婚   我是证婚人012---It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating...
我真的四点后就得走012---...so I really can't work past 4.
乔伊  你得待到戏拍完  我们不能因为你一个而暂停拍戏012---Joey, you've gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you.
又不是你要结婚012---It's not like it's your wedding.
我要动手术012---I'm having surgery.
什么012---What?
我骗你说我要结婚  因为我不希望你担心012---Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding, because I didn't want you to worry about me.
但其实今天我要动手术012---But I'm having surgery today.
什么样的手术012---What kind of surgery?
移植手术012---Transplant.
但你星期一都得拍戏的012---But you're supposed to work on Monday.
毛发移植手术012---Hair transplant.
但你不是秃头012---But you're not bald.
不是在我头上移植012---It's not on my head.
我真的帮不上忙  或许你可以在四点前离开012---Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you'll probably gonna be out by 4 anyway.
我们只要拍一场戏  就你跟理查  他是专业的012---We've got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro.
没问题的012---You'll be fine.
早安  理查012---Morning, Richard.
你来了  太棒了  我们开始吧012---Hey, you're here. Great! Great! Great! Let's get going, buddy.
我们继续拍戏012---we've got a scene to shoot!
我系了两条皮带012---I'm wearing two belts.
你喝醉了吗  没有012---Are you drunk? No.
你喝醉了012---Yes, you are.
算是吧012---All right.
原来这就是你的办公室012---So this is your office?
你们怎么找到我的  我真应该躲在健身房里的012---How'd you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym.
你到底在做什么啊   我在惊慌失措中012---What the hell are you doing? Panicking.
顺便上网找证据证明  我跟摩妮卡有血缘关系012---And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica.
她还好吗  她很好  她不知道你失踪了012---How is she? She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone.
她也不必知道  走吧  我们回家了012---And she doesn't have to know. okay? Now come on, we're going home.
不  不   我做不到  为什么012---No! No! I can't do that. Why not?
如果我回去  我们就会成为宾氏夫妇012---Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings.
我不能当宾氏夫妇012---I can't be the Bings.
宾氏夫妇有什么不对的012---What's wrong with being the Bings?
宾氏夫妇的婚姻很可怕012---The Bings have horrible marriages.
他们会吵架  打成一团012---They yell, They fight, And they use the pool boy...
还会把救生员  当成他们性爱游戏的玩物012---...as a pawn in their sexual games.
钱德  你有没有穿上黑色晚礼服  要我到你饭店的房间吗012---Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
没有  那么你不是你父母012---No. Then you are neither of your parents.
不止是他们的婚姻  看看你的婚姻  看看大家的婚姻012---It's not just their marriage. I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's.
只有保罗纽曼的婚姻幸福美满012---The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman!
我很清楚我自己  我又不是保罗纽曼012---And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman.
我不会赛车或做爆米花  也不会捐钱给慈善团体012---I don't race cars, I don't make popcorn. None of my proceeds go to charity.
听我说  钱德012---But look Chandler...
现在没有人比我更看不起你012---...right now no one has a lower opinion of you than I do.
但我完全相信你做得到012---But I totally believe you can do this.
我也想  我很爱她  但我害怕012---I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afraid--
这事太重要了012---Ahem. It's too huge.
你说得对  这是太重要了012---Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge.
我们为什么不一步一步慢慢来012---So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time. Okay?
暂时忘了结婚的事   忘了它012---Umm, forget getting married for a sec. just forget about it.
你能回家洗个澡吗012---Can you just come home and take a shower?
这没什么可怕的  是吗012---That's not scary, right?
那得看你说 "我们" 是什么意思012---Depends on what you mean by "we."
漫漫长夜是最难熬的012---The nights are the hardest.
但天亮了012---But then the day comes...
白天就跟黑夜一样难熬012---...and that's every bit as hard as the night.
然后黑夜又来了  白天跟黑夜都很难熬  我知道了012---And then the night comes again... The days and nights are hard, I get it.
对不起  我得开始准备了  今天我要结婚012---Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready. I'm getting married today.
我知道  在黄昏的时候012---I know. At dusk.
对我来说黄昏是很难熬的012---That's such a hard time for me.
我要化妆了  我们得在一小时内赶到饭店  好的012---I'm gonna go put my make up on, We have to be at the hotel in an hour! Okay.
等下  干嘛012---But wait! What?
我们去吃午饭吧012---Let's go to lunch.
我不能去吃午饭012---I can't go to lunch.
对喔012---Right.
天啊  我跌倒了012---Oh, good God, I've fallen down.
发生了什么事012---What's going on?
好吧012---0Kay.
好  听我说012---All right, honey, listen.
当我告诉你这件事时  我要你记得012---When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember...
我们都会支持你  我们都爱你012---...that we're all here for you, and that we love you.
好吧  你真的吓坏我了012---Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
我们找不到钱德012---We can't find Chandler--
的背心012---'s vest.
我们找不到钱德的背心012---We can't find Chandler's vest.
怎么可能  等一下  你是认真的吗012---How can that be? Oh wait! Wait, Are you, are you serious?
背心找到了012---Found the vest.
我们得看好它  不能再弄丢了012---I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again.
好吧  别那样吓我  好吗012---Oh, wow. Okay, don't scare me like that, okay?
刚刚我还想说  "天啊  最糟糕的事发生了"012---I mean for a minute, there I was like, "Oh, my God. The worst has happened."
你们两个结过婚012---So you two were married, huh?
后来发生了什么事  你们就慢慢疏远了012---What happened, you just drift apart?
新娘来了012---Here comes the bride.
我的天啊  摩妮卡012---Oh, my God, Monica.
我想每天都穿这件婚纱012---I want to wear this every day.
你真的好漂亮012---You look so beautiful.
我都为自己感到高兴012---I'm so happy for me.
喂  嘿  找到钱德了吗012---Hello? Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
我们找到他了  没事了  该死012---Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine. Damn it.
怎么了  你在哪里  我还在片场012---What? Why? Where are you? I'm still on the set.
乔伊  不到一小时婚礼就要开始了012---Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour.
我知道  对不起  跟我对戏的演员喝醉了  戏没拍好他们不让我离开012---I know! I'm sorry. The guy's drunk. They won't let me go until we get this.
我的天啊  我得再去找位牧师012---Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to find another minister.
不  不  我就是牧师012---No! No, I'm the minister.
听着  叫他们两个一起来听电话  我现在就帮他们证婚012---All right, look-look, Put them both on the phone and I'll marry them right now.
乔伊  我得挂电话了012---Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
嘿  别挂我电话啊  我现在就可以证婚  我有权力012---Hey! Don't hang up on me. I'll marry you and me right now. I have the power.
你看看  你现在穿上了礼服012---There you go. You put on a tuxedo.
一点都不可怕吧  对不012---Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
对012---No.
我跟你说   要一步一步慢慢来012---I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
好吧  接下来我们做什么012---Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
结婚啊  好  好012---Getting married. Okay. Okay.
你一定也能做好  就像其它你做好过的事一样012---You can, you can do that too. Just like you've done everything else.
你说得对  我可以做好  对012---Yeah, you're right. I can do that. Yeah.
我要出去下  你要去哪里012---Okay, excuse me for a minute. Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
罗斯  我不会再逃跑了  我只想呼吸点新鲜空气012---Ross, I'm not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
好吧  好吧012---okay. okay
喔  新鲜空气012---Oh, fresh air.

好吧  菲比  我们得想个办法012---Well Phoebe, We gotta do something.
乔伊没办法准时赶过来  我会看看  饭店里有没有其他人在办婚礼012---Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
别告诉他们摩妮卡怀孕了  因为他们厌恶那种事012---Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant, because they frown on that.
好吧012---0Kay.
"安纳斯塔赛奇斯  巴巴西法奇斯联姻"  太棒了012---"Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding." Excellent.
恭喜012---Congratulations.

我不知道  他们是希腊正教的信徒吗012---I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
是的  是的012---Yeah. Yeah.
他们是我的朋友  摩妮卡史蒂芬诺波里斯012---They're…they're-they're my friends, Monica Stephanopolis.

嗨012---Hi.
有人看到钱德了吗012---Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
我还以为他跟你在一起  他刚才是跟我在一起012---I thought he was with you. He-he was with me umm,
我们在玩游戏  捉迷藏012---We're playing a little game. y'know? Hide-and-seek.
你不能问我们  儿子  你那是作弊012---You can't ask us, son. That's cheating.
说得对  谢谢你纠正我  爸012---You're right. Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.
他最好别到这里来  他不能看到新娘穿婚纱的样子012---Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in her wedding dress.
我还记得我们结婚的时候  我看到新郎穿婚纱的样子了012---As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
那是婚礼后的事  那样就不会带来恶运了012---But that was after the wedding. It's not bad luck then.
甜心  那样也没带来好运啊012---Honey, it isn't good luck.
我的天啊  摩妮卡012---Oh, my God. Monica.
我知道012---I know.
钱德还好吗  他好极了012---Hey, how's Chandler doing? Great.
他非常好  别担心钱德012---He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
菲比  我能跟你谈下吗  没问题012---Phoebe, can I see you for a second? Yeah.
发生了什么事  钱德又不见了012---What's going on? Chandler's gone again.
天啊  为什么要跟一个可能会逃跑的人玩捉迷藏呢012---Oh my God! Why would you play hide-and-seek with someone you know is a flight risk?
艾朗  你得放我走  那家伙烂醉如泥012---Aaron, you gotta let me go. The guy's hammered.
对不起  只要他还清醒地待在这里  我们就得继续拍下去012---I'm sorry Joey, As long as he's here and he's conscious, we're still shooting.
你有没有根大号的叉子啊012---You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
我刚刚跟导演谈过了012---So I uh, I just talked to the director.
就这样  今天就拍到这里了012---That's it. We're done for the day.
我们的戏拍完了吗012---Well have we finished the scene?
对  你表现的很棒  你也是012---Yeah. You were wonderful. As were you.
我把你的车开过来了  车子就停在外面012---So I got your car. It's right outside.

不  不  我们得走了  来吧  要走了012---No-no-no! we gotta go. Come on. Here we go.
那是我的屁股吗012---Is that my ass?
他在那里  干嘛012---There he is! What?
嘿012---Hey! Whoa!
这次你逃不了  先生012---You're not getting away this time mister!
除非你真的要我痛扁你012---Unless you want that ass-kicking we talked about.
罗斯  嘿呀012---Ross. Hi-yah!
我是认真的  你别想抛弃我妹妹012---I'm serious. You're not walking out on my sister.
没错  我不会的012---That's right. I'm not.
那你跑到哪里去了  我知道摩妮卡的事012---Then where the hell have you been? I know about Monica.
你知道了  什么012---You know? What?
我听到你跟瑞秋说话  什么  什么  说了什么012---Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking. What?! What?! Talking about what?!
你不知道吗012---You don't know?
知道什么  如果你们不立刻告诉我发生了什么事012---Know what—If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
干嘛  你会"嘿呀"吗012---What, you'll "hi-yah"?
摩妮卡怀孕了012---Monica's pregnant.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我的天啊  你没有被吓跑吗012---Oh, my God. And you're not freaking out?
我是吓坏了  后来我去了礼品店买香烟012---Well I was. Then I went down to the gift shop because cigarettes.
香烟  请谈正事012---Cigarettes? Big picture, please.
我在礼品店看到这个东西012---So I was in the gift shop, that's when I saw this...
我想  能穿上这玩意的东西  应该不可怕012---Yeah, y'know what? And I thought anything that can fit into this can't be scary.
很明显地  你没看过《灵异入侵少年军团3》012---Well you obviously didn't see Chuckie III.
别这样  看看这件小衣服有多可爱012---But come on, look at how cute and small this is.
我要把它送给摩妮卡  她会知道我没事的012---So I got it to give Monica, so she'd know I was okay.
兄弟012---Dude.
做得好  儿子  我就知道你一定能找到他012---Way to go, son. I knew you'd find him.
我们的小儿子要结婚了012---Our little boy is getting married.
看看你  真的好英俊012---Oh Look at you, so handsome.
你看起来很漂亮  妈012---You look beautiful, Mom.
你看起来也很漂亮  爸012---You look beautiful too, Dad.
我爱你们012---I love you both.
我很高兴你们都来了012---I'm so glad you're here.
你是钱德吗012---Are you Chandler?
你是乔伊吗012---Are you Joey?
这真的是太棒了  什么012---Huh. This is nice. What?
这是我第一次走在红毯上  知道自己不可能会离婚了012---I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
真希望你祖母能活着看到这一幕012---Oh I wish your grandmother had lived to see this.
但奶奶就在那边啊  不是那个老太婆  我是说我妈012---She's right there. Not that old crone. My mother.
恭喜你  亲爱的012---Congratulations, darling.
我们爱你  甜心012---We love you, sweetheart.
你看起来好美012---You look beautiful.
这是新买的吗  不要现在讨论012---Is this new? Not now.
他是谁  我是卡扛巴索斯神父012---Who's this? I'm Father Karabasos.
他是希腊正教的神父012---He's Greek Orthodox.
你们也是希腊正教的信徒012---As are you.
开始举行婚礼吧012---Let us begin.
亲爱的来宾012---Dearly beloved--
那是我的台词012---That's my line.
我从这里开始接手  谢谢012---I can take it from here. Thanks.
亲爱的来宾  抱歉我来迟了一点012---Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late.
或许你们会觉得很困惑012---You may be confused by this now...
但到了2002年阵亡将士纪念日  你们就会了解了012---...but you won't be Memorial Day weekend, 2002.
快点开始婚礼吧   免得新郎又逃跑了012---Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again.
今天我们齐聚在这里012---We are gathered here today...
参加这个男人012---...to join this man...
跟这个女人神圣的婚礼012---...and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
我跟摩妮卡及钱德认识很久了  我不能想像012---I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can't...
有谁会比他们两个更般配012---...imagine two people more perfect for each other.
因为我把演讲稿  忘在更衣室里012---And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room...
所以  我们直接念誓词吧  摩妮卡012---...we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
他逃跑了  快点  快点012---He took off? Go on. Go on.
钱德  从小012---Chandler, for so long...
我就在想  我能不能找到我的白马王子012---...I wondered if I would ever find my prince.
我的灵魂伴侣012---My soul mate.
三年前  在另一场婚礼012---Then three years ago, at another wedding...
我向朋友寻求安慰012---...I turned to a friend for comfort.
结果我找到了  我一直在找的一切012---And instead, I found everything that I'd been looking for my whole life.
现在012---And now...
我们在这里012---...here we are...
一起迎接未来012---...with our future before us.
我只想跟你在一起012---And I only want to spend it with you.
我的白马王子   我的灵魂伴侣012---My prince. My soul mate.
我的朋友012---My friend.
除非你不愿意012---Unless you don't want to.
轮到你了012---You go.
钱德012---Chandler?
不  没关系012---No, that's okay.
摩尼卡  我以为这会是我做的最艰难的一件事012---Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do.
但我看到你走过红毯时  我了解到它真的很简单012---But when I saw you walking down that aisle, I realized how simple it was.
我爱你012---I love you.
不论出现什么样的惊喜  没关系  因为我会永远爱你012---Any surprises that come our way, it's okay, because I will always love you.
