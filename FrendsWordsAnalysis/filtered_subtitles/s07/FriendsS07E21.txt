4个星期  宝贝  4个星期012---Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!
你有没有意识到你的嗓门越来越大了012---You realize you get louder each week?
还有这么多事要做  你写好你的婚礼誓词了吗012---There's still so much to do! Have you written your vows yet?
我想我会去买 "派特  我要买婚礼誓词"012---I figured I'd just buy those. "Pat, I'd like to buy a vow." Ha, ha.
亲爱的  你知道讲到婚礼  我是没有幽默感的012---Sweetie, you know I've no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
对  你写了你的了吗  还没有  但我知道我要说什么012---Right. So uh, have you written yours yet? No, but I know exactly what I'm gonna say.
你会不会刚好知道  我要说什么呢012---Do you happen to know what I'm gonna say?
现在写  没有那么困难012---Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard.
说你心里想的012---Just say what's in your heart.
看她写得多快  她一定爱我比我爱她更多012---Look at her go. She must love me more than I love her!
我是怎么啦  噢  不要开始这么想012---What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.

这你做过了  你的婚礼誓词里要说什么012---All right, uh...Uh-Oh! You've done this before. What did you say in your vows?
对卡萝  我承诺过对她至死不渝012---Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die.
她却没有这样保证过012---She made no such promise.
我真悲哀  摩妮卡知道要说什么  你没看到她下笔如飞的样子012---I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! you should have seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
摩妮卡  什么  紧急大事012---Monica what? What?! What's the emergency?

谢谢  只是除了你的胸部看起来有一点小外012---Thank you. Yeah, except your breasts look small.
那是我的眼睛012---Those are my eyes!
这才是我的胸部  是嘛  好吧012---Those are my breasts. Oh, yeah.
你何不从简单的开始012---Well, why don't you just start with something simple?
像是012---Like, urn:
"摩妮卡  我一遇到你就爱上了你"012---"Monica, from the moment I met you I knew I loved you."
我做不到012---Yeah, I' m not sure I can't do that.

好吧  好吧  也许你这么起头好了012---Okay, okay. Um, maybe you could start with:
"钱德  即使在我们还是朋友时012---"Chandler, even though we were friends...
我内心就想进一步发展"012---...there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
好吧  假如人类发生了一场核子浩劫  我是地球上最后一个男人012---All right, there's a nuclear holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.
你会和我约会吗012---Would you go outwith me?
婚礼誓词里可以说谎吗012---Ooh! Are we allowed to lie in the vows?
也许那时不要谈你的感情   就说些012---Well maybe you don't talk about those feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know ...
他教会你的事  像是012---...all the things he's taught you, like--

你会有个的  是啊  什么时候012---You'll get one. Yeah, when?
这样吧  我告诉你012---All right, I'll tell you what.
等40岁的时候  如果我们都还没结婚012---When we're 40, if neither of us are married...
我们俩来生个如何  我为什么会40岁还没结婚012---...what do you say you and I get together and have one? Why wouldn't I be married when I'm 40?
不  不  我只是说"假设"012---Oh, no, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
好  我们来假设  我为什么会40岁还没结婚012---Ok, Hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?

摩妮卡012---Look, Monica-Ah!
没有用的  我保证这有用012---Look! This is not gonna work. I bet this'll work.
你真棒  我爱你012---You are so great! I love you.
什么012---What?
没事  我说  你真棒  然后就没说话了012---Nothing! I said, I said you're so great, and then I just, I just stopped talking.
你说你爱我  我不敢相信  不  我没有012---You said you love me! I can't believe this! No, I didn't.

你的东西都会在这里012---Then all your stuff would be here.
那012---Well...
如果我的东西都在这里呢012---What if all my stuff was here?
那你会一直来回跑来跑去012---Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.
干嘛要那样呢012---Doesn't make any sense.
好012---0Kay.
那如果我们是住在一起  你明白我在说什么嘛012---What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying?
你希望这是一个惊喜012---You wanted it to be a surprise.
我的天012---Oh, my God!
钱德012---Chandler...
我这一生012---...in all my life...
从没想过我会这么幸运012---...I never thought I'd be so lucky...
能爱上我最好的012---...as to fall in love with my best--
我最好的  女生不这么做是有原因的012---My best-There's a reason why girls don't do this!
好  好  我来012---Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.
我以为012---I thought--
我做得到012---I can do this.
我以为012---I thought...
我说什么  和在哪里说很重要012---...that it mattered what I said or where I said it.
但我发现唯一重要的是你012---Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you--
你让我比我能想像的更快乐012---You make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
如果你愿意012---And if you let me...
我要用这一生  来让你有同样的感觉012---...I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.

帮钱德写他的婚礼誓词  他把我们赶出来了012---Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows. but he kicked us out
因为乔伊老是想一些不合时宜的点子012---because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
"摩妮卡  我爱你的美臀"  这有什么不得体012---How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass" inappropriate?
摩妮卡写得怎么样了012---How's Monica coming along with her vows?
这样说吧  幸好她有一个美臀  因为她不太擅长写作012---Well let's just say its she's lucky she's got a sweet ass. She's not so good at writing.
真不敢相信再过4个星期  他们就要结婚了012---I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!

真不敢相信012---I can't believe...
他们在一起3年了  那么久了012---...they've been together 3 years. Has it been that long?!
感觉没那么久  因为他们瞒了我们很久012---Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
是我  进来了012---Hey, it's me. Coming in.
我今天辛苦了一整天012---I've had a very long, hard day.
我要去买炸鸡  你要不要  不  谢了  不要炸鸡  再见012---Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some? Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
你还好吧  抱歉012---Are you okay? I'm so sorry.
他不肯离开  一直问我要不要炸鸡012---He wouldn't leave. He kept asking if I wanted chicken.
炸鸡012---Chicken?
我可以来点炸鸡012---I could eat some chicken.
乔伊012---Hey, Joe!
我想要三块鸡肉  包心菜沙拉  豆子  还有可乐012---Can I get a, uh, three-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke—
健怡可乐012---Diet Coke.
不知道他们为什么不直接告诉我们  对啊  好像我们不会认同似的012---I don't know why they didn't just tell us. I know, I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
你  还有你012---You? And you?

怎么会  什么时候012---How? When?
在伦敦发生的  在伦敦啊012---It happened in London. In London?
我们没告诉任何人  因为我们不希望小事变大012---The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
可是这是大事012---But it is a big deal!
我一定要告诉别人  不  不要012---I have to tell someone. No-no-no-no-no!
不行  拜托  拜托012---You can't. Please! Please?!

现在他们知道你知道  但他们不知道瑞秋知道012---Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
对  但你知道吗  谁知道什么并不重要012---Yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what.
现在有足够的人知道  就可以告诉他们我们知道了012---Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know.
谎言  秘密终于可以结束了012---Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
或者我们不要告诉他们我们知道  我们就可以找点小乐子012---Or, we can not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.

乔伊  你什么也不能说012---Joey, you can't say anything.
就算我想说  也不知道要怎么说012---I couldn't even if I wanted too.
这完全失控了012---Listen, this is totally getting out of hand.
她要我替她抹乳液  她在唬你012---Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! She's bluffing!
她没有退缩  她还这样012---Look, she's not backing down. She went like this.
他没有退缩  他去拿乳液了012---He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
天啊  你们还没玩完吗012---Oh, man. Aren't you guys done yet?
乔伊  菲比早点搞定钱德  这事就会早一点公开  早点结束012---Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.

会和其他有孩子的夫妇在一起012---...and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
也许他们会搬离城市012---And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city...
到某个靠近富豪车商的地方012---...to be near a Volvo dealership.
事情会变的012---Well, things change.
