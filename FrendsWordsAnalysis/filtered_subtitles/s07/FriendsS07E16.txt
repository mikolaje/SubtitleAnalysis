可以帮我一个大忙吗012---Hey listen can you do me a big favor?
院长办公室召开紧急会议012---The, uh, dean's office called and said there was an urgent meeting.
替我照看小班一小时好吗012---Can you watch Ben for an hour?
摩妮卡呢  她不在家012---Well, What-what about Monica? Uh, she isn't home.
只有我一个人012---So it would just be me alone?
小班也会在  不是012---Well, Ben would be there. No.
怎么了  那个  只是012---What's the matter? Well, uh, you know, it's just, uh...
我从没试过呢  和他单独在一起012---I've never done that before. Me and him, alone.
他又没有犯罪前科012---He's not an ex-con.
好  好吧012---Okay, okay, okay. Um...
我和他做什么呢  我不知道  和他说说话012---What do I, What do I do with him? I don't know, Just-just talk to him.

你可以吧012---Are you gonna be okay?
我可以  我不是和你说话012---Yeah I think so. I wasn't talking to you.
老友记  第七季  第16集  伦敦真相012---Friends  S07E16  The One With The Truth About London
第二位牧师如何  我还蛮喜欢他的012---What about the second minister we meet with? I kind of liked him.
你指喷口水那个  别这样  他还没那么糟012---You mean the spitter? Come on. He wasn't that bad.
说的容易  你倒遮着面纱012---Easy for you to say, you'd be wearing a veil.
第三个呢   那个直盯着你的胸部看012---what about the third guy? You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest.
你能怪他吗012---Can you blame him?
我不希望我说  "我愿意"时012---Sorry, I just don't like the idea of me saying, "I do"...
他想着 "我也愿意"012---...he's thinking, "I'd do it too."
那我们还有一个问题  什么012---Well, then we still have a problem. With what?
我们需要证婚人012---Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding...
但他们都相当的无趣  要么就是相当讨厌012---...and they're all either boring or annoying...
要么就是一直盯着女生看012---...or can't stop staring at the ladies.
应该让我们其中一人来证婚012---Ooh, you should have one of us do it.
我们是要 "结婚" 结婚  不是"六年级"的结婚012---Phoebe, We're getting "married" married, not "6th-grade" married.
是真的012---No! No! it's a real thing.
任何人都能在网络上被任命为牧师然后来证婚012---Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform weddings and stuff.
我要012---I call it!
什么啊  是我的主意012---What? It was my idea!
非常感谢你们  但你们  谁也不会替我们证婚012---Thank you very much, but neither of you is marrying us.
提出请求不再有任何意义了吗012---Does calling it not mean anything anymore?
我们要一位正式的牧师012---We are going to having a legitimate clergy member.
我说正式   指的是同性恋012---And when I say legitimate, I mean gay...
而且能控制自己口水的012---...and in control of his saliva.
小班  你知道  当你还是个婴儿时012---Ben, you know, when, uh-When you were a baby...
我们就常在一起了012---...you and I used to hang out all the time.
那时候我是你爸的女朋友012---Because I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
可是你现在不是了012---But you're not anymore.
不  我不是  因为你们想分开一下012---No, I'm not. Because you guys were on a break--
嘿  我们不是那样012---Hey, we were not on a Okay.
我爸什么时候会回来  52分钟后012---When's my daddy coming back? Fifty-two minutes.
你没有兄弟姊妹  是吧012---So no brothers or sisters, huh?
我有两个姊妹  我们彼此折磨012---But You know what, I had two sisters and we just tortured each other.
真的  像怎样  我们会012---Really? Like how? Well, you know, we would, um...
重覆另一个人说的每一句话012---We'd repeat everything the other said...
或是从衣柜跳出去吓人012---...or, uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other...
或是把糖换成盐  让别人把盐倒到早餐麦片里012---...or, ha, switch the sugar for the salt so they put salt on their cereal.
这个不错012---That's a good one.
你喜欢吗  是啊  你真好玩012---Yeah, you like that one? Yeah, you're funny.
我真的好玩吗012---I'm funny?
感谢上帝012---Oh, thank God.
嘿  我有一大堆这种故事012---Well, hey, I got a ton of these.
拿一枚25分硬币012---Um, you, uh-You take a quarter...
你拿一枚25分硬币012---You take a quarter...
把边缘涂黑012---...and you blacken the edge, right?
然后说 "我打赌  你不能让这枚硬币012---And then you say to person, "I bet you can't roll this quarter...
滚过你的下巴而不离开你的脸"012---...from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face."
等他们这么做了  就会在脸正中央留下一条线012---And when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
我可以对你这样吗012---Can I do it to you?
小班  我这是幽默  但我不笨012---Yeah, I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.
好吧012---Heh, okay?
你们找到证婚人了吗012---So did you, uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
没有  但"痴迷摩妮卡"的牧师打电话来012---No, but "Horny for Monica" minister called...
想知道我们是否还在一起012---...wanting to know if we're still together.
我们永远不会找到人的   要不让我来012---We'll never find anybody. Then let me do it.
乔伊  不不不  我想过了012---Joe-No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it.
我是个演员  我在人前也不会紧张012---I'm an actor right? so I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
我不会喷口水  也不会盯着摩妮卡的胸部看012---I won't spit and I won't stare at Monica's breasts.
大家都知道我喜欢的是臀部012---Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man.
那倒是真的  最重要的是012---That is true. Yeah and the most important thing...
不会是一位不认识你们的陌生人替你们证婚012---...is it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
而会是我  我发誓  我会做得很好012---It'll be me. And I swear, I'll do a really good job.
还有  我爱你们  这对我意义重大012---Plus, y'know I love you guys and it would really mean a lot to me.
这样也蛮酷的012---Might be kind of cool.
我可以吗  好啊  就你吧012---So I can do it? Yeah, you can do it.
好啊  好012---All right! Okay!
好  我要开始准备我的演说了012---Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech.
等一下012---Wait a minute.
网络上任命的牧师还是可以做爱吧  对啊  嗯012---Internet ministers can still have sex right? Yeah.
来了012---Coming.
我要找你麻烦012---I have a bone to pick with you.
对  小班学了一个恶作剧012---Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
他是不是  对  是的012---Oh yeah? did he pull the old--? That's right, that's right.
马桶座位上包了保鲜膜012---Saran wrap on the toilet seat...
于是尿尿喷得到处都是012---...so the pee goes everywhere.
哦  那个啊  对  那个012---Oh, that. Yeah, that.
你知道我最恨恶作剧的012---You know I hate practical jokes.
恶作剧低级又愚蠢   我才不要我儿子学这些012---They're mean, they're stupid and I don't want my son learning them.
拜托  马桶包了保鲜膜  你不觉得有一点点好笑吗012---Oh, come on. Saran wrap on the toilet seat? you don't think that just a little funny?
我光着脚012---I was barefoot. Oh.
现在告诉我  你只教了他马桶这一招  对不012---Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him, right?
对012---Yes.
嘿  向乔伊崔比亚尼牧师打招呼吧012---Hey. Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.
你做了  被任命了  对啊012---You did it! You got ordained? Yeah.
才下网  网上好多色情图片啊012---Just got off the Internet. Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

我已经写下我在婚礼要说的话了  要听吗012---Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony. Want to hear it?
好啊  注意  这只是第一篇草稿  所以012---Okay. Yeah. Now-now, Listen, this is just the first draft, so...
"今天我们齐聚此处  在这个喜悦的场合012---"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion...
来庆祝摩妮卡和钱德之间特别的爱"012---...to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.
对012---Huh? Right.
"这是奠基在付出和接受012---It is a love based on giving and receiving...
拥有和分享的爱012---...as well as having and sharing.
他们付出和拥有的爱被分享和接受了012---And the love that they give and have is shared and received.
藉着这样的拥有和付出012---And through this having and giving...
以及分享和接受012---...and sharing and receiving...
我们同样分享爱和拥有012---...we too can share and love and have...
还有接受"012---...and receive."
要不要打电话给喷口水的012---Should we call the spitter?
嘿  瑞秋  嗨012---Ha! Hey, Rachel. Hi.
好个惊喜  你怎么在这儿012---What a surprise. What are you doing here?
我正好在附近012---Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood...
经过你家  我就在想 "卡萝和可爱的小班012---...and I passed by your building and thought to myself, "What's up with Carol...
不知道怎么样了"012---...and sweet little Ben?"
真好  请进吧  好的012---That's nice. Well, uh, come on in. Okay.
我来煮咖啡   然后我们可以聊聊天012---Um, I'll make some coffee and, uh, we can chat.
好啊  太好了012---I'd love that. I would love that.
可爱的小班呢012---So, uh-So where is sweet little Ben?
我想和小012---I would love to have a little--
找到他了012---I found him!
好好笑  过来012---Very funny. Come here.
这就是我来找你谈的原因012---That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you, okay?
瑞秋  咖啡要加糖吗  好  那个012---Rach, you want some sugar in your coffee? Yes, but--
我的咖啡要不要加糖012---Do I want sugar in my coffee?
不加糖了  只加牛奶  谢谢012---No, just some milk would be good, Carol. Thanks.
记得我昨天教你的那些东西012---Okay. Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
"记得我昨天教你的那些东西"012---"Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?"
不要这样   "不要这样"012---Don't do that. "Don't do that."
你爸爸不喜欢恶作剧  "你爸爸不喜欢恶作剧"012---Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks. "Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks."
可恶  "可恶"012---Oh, damn it. "Oh, damn it!"
不  不要这么说012---No! Don't say that.
可恶  重覆我的说话012---Damn it! Go back to repeating.
可恶   真烂012---Damn it! Oh, crap.
"真烂"012---"Oh, crap!" Oh.
好  我又写了一些  准备好了吗012---Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
是  好012---Yeah, okay.
"当我想到这两位付出者  和接受者所分享的爱012---"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share...
我禁不住嫉妒  之后一生的拥有和爱012---...I can't help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving...
和付出"   我想不出这里要用什么字012---...and giving--" And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
用 "接受" 如何  对012---How about "receiving"? Yes!
乔伊  不是嫌你写得不好012---See, Joe, not that that's not great...
但找熟人朋友证婚的好处012---...but one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony...
就是能够和我们贴得更近012---...is that it can be about us.
你可以更有针对性  可以讲  我们的故事012---Y'know, It can be more personal. You can tell stories about us.
好  我可以谈谈伦敦  是在那儿你们俩个搞上了012---Ooh! Ooh! Okay, Maybe I'll talk about London. You know, when you two hooked up.
只是我不会说 "搞上了"012---Only I won't say "hooked up"...
我会说  "他们展开的美好旅程012---...I'll say, "began their beautiful journey...
对了   "是从他们做了开始的"012---There you go. ...by doing it."
乔伊  好吧012---Joe. Okay, all right, um...
所以是怎么开始的呢  你们的双眼越过房间相遇012---So, uh-So how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room...
然后你在浴缸里  她在喂你吃草莓012---...And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
那不是发生在你和伴娘身上的吗  对啊012---Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid? Yeah!
我叫它  "伦敦式艳遇"012---I call that "London style."
没发生在我们身上012---No that is not what happened with us.
也许你应该说有  因为"伦敦式艳遇"听来不错012---Ooh, but maybe you should say it is, because "London style" sounds nice.
对012---Yeah.
好吧012---Okay, uh...
那天晚上我很难过  因为有个家伙以为我是罗斯的妈妈012---Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought I was Ross' mom.
钱德对我很好  一直在安慰我012---And then Chandler was really sweet and he consoled me...
而我们确实喝多了  对了  宝贝012---...and we drank too much. Yeah, baby.
我很绅士地陪她走回  旅馆房间  道了晚安012---I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said good night.
但那晚上后来呢  晚些时候  这才对  宝贝012---But then, later that night-Yeah, baby.
嘿012---Hey.
可爱的睡衣  真的像在伦敦家里过的多采多姿啊012---Cute P.J.s. Really living it up here in London, huh?
我想不会再有人来  现在已经012---Well I was...I wasn't exactly expecting company after...
9点15分012---9:15.
乔伊在吗012---Is Joey here?
上次我看到他时  他和伴娘在一起还拿着一篮草莓出去了012---Last I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries.
你不会还在为那个家伙的话生气吧012---So, uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told you, are you?
你不会吗012---Wouldn't you be?
这是一个很感人的时刻  你又喝了很多012---Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink...
可你必须忘了那事  好吗012---You have to let that go, okay?
你是今晚屋里最美的女人012---I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.
真的012---Really?
那还用说  你是在大多数地方  都显得最美的女人012---You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms--
喔  喔  怎么了  我们亲嘴了012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? You and I just made out!
我们亲嘴了  现在没有012---You and I just made out! Not anymore.
可是我们不能这样的  我知道  我以为会很好玩012---But we don't do that. I know, I thought it would be fun.
你有多醉了012---How drunk are you?
醉得想要你   但还没醉得神志不清012---Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
不多不少恰恰好012---That's the perfect amount.
你知道哪里奇怪吗  哪里012---You know what's weird? What?
咱们越轨却感觉一点都不奇怪  可不是嘛012---This doesn't feel weird. I know.
你真是接吻高手  我吻过不止四个女人012---You're a really good kisser. Well, I have kissed over four women.
钻到被窝里如何012---Do you wanna get under the covers? Mm-hm.
好啊012---0Kay.
哇  你动作好快012---Wow, you are really fast!
我想你会欣赏速度的  对我来说是个好兆头012---It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
我们要"裸诚相见"了  对012---We're gonna see each other naked. Yep.
同时做   我数到三012---Do you wanna do it at the same time? Count of three?
一   二   三012---One, two, three.
我想我们的友谊  毫不夸张的说被彻底破坏了012---Well, I think it's safe to say our friendship is effectively ruined.
反正我们本来也没那么亲近012---Eh, we weren't that close anyway. Eh.
乔伊  乔伊  乔伊  是乔伊012---Joey, Joey, Joey. It's Joey.
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  乔伊  我在看电影012---Hey, Joe. I was just watching a movie...
老兄  对不起012---Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
不  不  不是012---No! No! No!
不  不  不  没事  我还跟伴娘在一起012---Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool, It's cool! I'll only be a second,I'm still with my bridesmaid.
保险套在哪儿012---I just—Where are the condoms you brought?
在那边  我的袋子里012---They're in my bag over there.
可以给我留一个吗012---...could you leave me one?
给你一个人012---For just you?
对012---Yeah.
好  给你  老兄012---All right. There you go, buddy.
你去疯吧012---Go nuts.
原来是为了那件事用的012---That's what that was?
如果我没留一个给你012---Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one?
你们两个可能永远不会在一起012---You two might've never gotten together.
想像一下  如果我照原来计划  送了一个妓女上去会怎样012---Oh, ooh. Can you imagine if I had sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?!
就像在天上一样012---It's like it was in the stars. Hmm.
是啊  你们是注定在一起的012---Yeah, totally meant to be.
告诉他你原先那晚是要去找谁的012---Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
什么  什么012---What? What?
什么012---What?
你原先是要去找谁的012---Who did you originally want to hook up with?
好吧  拜托  不要生气012---Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.
我那时真的很沮丧  好吗  而且醉得很厉害012---Okay? I was really depressed, okay? And really drunk.
我只想干点毫无意义的傻事  我只想...只想纯做爱  所以012---I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So
那晚我到你们房间012---when I went to your room that night...
其实是要找乔伊的012---...I was actually looking for Joey.
好啊  宝贝012---Yeah, baby.
不  宝贝012---No, baby.
哦  我的天012---Oh, my God.
你来找乔伊的012---You came to the room looking for Joey?
你有没有想过要告诉我  没有  我觉得这不重要012---Were you planning on telling me this? No, I didn't think it was important.
这不重要  这不重要012---It's not important? It's not important?
如果没有那个伴娘  你嫁的会是他而不是我012---If it wasn't for a bridesmaid, you'd be marrying him not me!
不  你知道我有多高兴  乔伊不在那里吗012---No! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey wasn't there that night!
嘿012---Hey!
虽然我是神职人员  可是我还是有感觉的012---I'm a man of the cloth but I still have feelings.
现在你不可能替我们证婚了012---Look there's no way you're doing this wedding now, okay?
什么  不公平  不是我的错012---What? That's not fair. It's not my fault.
我和伴娘在一起012---I was off with my bridesmaid.
而且谁说我会答应的012---And who's to say I would've said yes?
我是说  我会答应的012---I mean, I would've said yes.
钱德  你把这件事看得太严重了012---Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this. all right?
现在不是一切都很好嘛012---Everything worked out okay.
只是很奇怪012---It's just weird,
我不想站在那儿说婚誓时  脑子里全是你和摩妮卡的画面012---Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica.
我要  我不知道我要干什么  我要去走走了012---I need-I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
等下  钱德  没有什么大不了的  对我是012---Wait, Chandler, come on, it's not a big deal. It is to me.
你想和蝙蝠侠上床   可你不得不和罗宾将就着干了012---You wanted to sleep with Batman and instead you had to settled for Robin.
这太疯狂了  是啊  罗宾好像是同性恋012---This is crazy. No, Robin is so gay.
我们都同意了  不再恶作剧012---So now what have we agreed? No more pranks.
还有呢  你和爸爸不是想分开下012---What else? You and Daddy were not on a break.
很好012---Very good.
瑞秋  你在这里干什么012---Rachel, what are you doing here?
拜访我的好朋友卡萝012---I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
你的好朋友  对012---Your good friend? Yeah.
她姓什么012---What's her last name?
卡萝012---Carol...
同性恋  很好012---...Lesbian. Nice.
还有  我脸上那条线012---By the way, that, uh-That line down my face...
在今天最后一堂课  让一个学生说012---The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say:
"老兄  你从来不洗脸吗"012---"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"
我很抱歉  没有告诉你012---All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
听着  我不要你再教我儿子那些鬼东西012---I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore.
好吗  好  好012---Okay? Fine. Fine.
不过我要告诉你  我一教他那些东西  他叫我"好玩的瑞秋阿姨"012---but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff, he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."
我喜欢做 "好玩的瑞秋阿姨"012---And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.
我很高兴你们能建立感情  但012---I'm glad you guys were bonding but--
听着  他没有任何兄弟姊妹012---Look, he doesn't have any brothers or sisters,
得有人教他这些东西012---Somebody has to teach him this stuff.
我又没有教他任何  正常6岁孩子不该会的东西012---And I haven't taught him anything a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
