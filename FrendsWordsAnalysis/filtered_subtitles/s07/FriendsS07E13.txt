嘿  你在做什么  嗨012---Hey. What are you doing? Hi.
我想把沙发搬开012---Well, you know, I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
为什么要那样呢012---Why would you want to do that?
那样子我就有好位置可以坐了012---So that there would be a decent place for me to sit?
瑞秋  你本来就有好位置坐了  你的大腿不算012---Rach, there is a decent place to... And your lap does not count.
来吧  帮我把它搬开  不  不  不012---Okay? Come on, help me move this. No, no, no.
你不要  不要012---No? No.
萝希塔不想移开012---Rosita does not move.
对不起  萝希塔  是012---I'm sorry. Rosita? As in--?
就是 "不想动的萝希塔"012---As in "Rosita does not move."
乔伊  只不过是一张椅子  有什么大不了的012---Joey, it's just a chair. What's the big deal?
大不了的是  它到浴室跟到厨房的距离是一样的012---The big deal is that it's the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen...
而且它的角度让你完全  看不到史提夫的反光012---...and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming off of Stevie.
电视机史提夫012---Stevie the TV?
有问题吗  没有012---Is there a problem? No.
他又知道什么012---Oh, what does he know?
来吧  萝希塔  我们这些辣妹得合作才行012---Come on, Rosita. Us chicas gotta stick together.
你这个臭女人012---You bitch.
老友记  第七季  第13集  萝希塔之死012---Friends  S07E13  The One Where Rosita Dies
嘿  罗斯012---Hey, Ross?
我看过房地产广告版012---So I was checking out the real-estate section.
你看这个012---Yeah. Look at this.
看起来好像爸妈的房子012---Oh, it looks like Mom and Dad's house.
院子里的树  正前方也有根断掉的树枝012---Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front.
阁楼的窗户012---And the, uh, window in the attic...
喔  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
怎么了  阁楼的窗户怎么了012---What? What happened to the window in the attic?
我不敢相信他们要把它卖掉012---I can't believe Mom and Dad are selling the house.
却没有告诉我们012---I can't believe they didn't even tell us.
阁楼的窗户到底是怎么了012---I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic.
乔伊  我会买张新椅子赔你  好吗012---Okay, come on. Joey, I'll buy you a new one, all right?
我们马上到店里去  帮你买一张新椅子012---We'll go down to the store right now and we'll get you a new chair.
她还尸骨未寒012---She's not even cold yet.
萝希塔难道不希望  你继续过你的日子吗012---But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on?
我是说她永远  把你的幸福放在第一位012---I mean, you know, she did always put your comfort first.
没错012---That's true.
我不敢相信  我们得跟小时候的家说再见了012---I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
天啊  有个陌生人  就要搬进我的房间里012---Man, some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
15年来  他们把你房间  弄得跟神宠差不多012---Well, after 15 years of Morn and Dad keeping it as a shrine to you...
现在一切都该落幕了012---...it's time the velvet ropes came down.
他们也保留你房间有一阵子了012---They kept your room a while.
拜托  我搬出来20分钟后  爸就把我的房间变成健身房了012---Oh, please. Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.
我得说  一张日光浴椅  跟一堆维多利亚秘密的目录012---And I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogs?
那不是健身房012---Not a gym.
别这样  你知道他们爱你  就跟他们爱你一样012---Come on. You know they love you. As much as they love you?
我没出生前  他们以为她不会生  那不是我的错012---I was their first born. They thought she was barren. It's not my fault.
我讨厌今年012---Ugh. I hate this year.
今年有什么不对的了012---What's wrong with this year?
现在已经是二月  我只接到两个按摩客人012---It's already February and I've only given two massages...
而且他们给小费都给得很吝啬012---...and they were both the worst tippers in the world.
你是指我跟罗斯012---That was me and Ross.
喔  没错012---Oh, that's right.
如果你需要钱012---Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash...
我大学的朋友  做电话行销赚了不少钱012---...some friends of mine made good money in college doing telemarketing.
它一定比上次  我做的电话行销工作还棒012---Yeah, it'd probably be better than the last telephone job I had.
或许我不必常常说 "打我屁股吧"012---You know, I probably won't have to say "spank" as much.
什么012---What?
对  你从来没打过那种电话012---Oh, yeah, like you never called.
真的很简单啊   你只要照着稿子念012---So, basically, this is very easy. You read from the script...
试着多卖一点碳粉就行012---...and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
好吧  我办得到012---Okay, I can do that.
对了  我喜欢我的办公室012---Oh, by the way, I love my office. Ha, ha.
我们为什么不来练习一下   好吧012---Why don't we do a trial run? Oh, okay.
好吧012---Um, all right.
嗨  我是帝国办公室文具公司的菲比012---Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
请问总务部经理在吗012---Can I speak to your supply manager, please?
我就是总务部经理012---I'm the supply manager.
好  我想跟你谈谈买碳粉的事012---Um, okay. I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
我们不需要碳粉  好吧  抱歉打扰你了  再见012---We don't need any toner. Well, I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.
你说的对  这工作真的很容易012---Yeah, you're right. This is easy.
好吧  感觉那通电话哪里不对劲呢012---Okay. What was wrong with that call?
好吧012---Oh, well, all right.
我没有恶意  但你的态度真的很不好012---Um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
他们永远都会说  他们不需要碳粉  没关系012---They're always gonna tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay.
不管他们说什么012---Because whatever they say...
你都会在稿子里找到标准答案012---...you can find the answer to it, here in the script.
我想  你准备好要卖碳粉了012---Oh. So I think you're ready to sell toner.
还有问题吗  没有了012---Do you have any last questions? No.
等一下  对了  我的确有一个问题012---Oh, wait, yes, I do. I do have one question:
什么是碳粉012---What is toner?
乔伊012---Joey?
乔伊012---JOe?
原封未动012---Full bag?
啤酒还是冰的012---Beer's still cold.
这里一定发生了很可怕的事012---Something terrible must have happened here.
喔  不  不012---Oh, no, no, no.
史提夫  我没来过这里012---Stevie, I was never here.
爸  我在这里012---Dad? I'm here.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
感觉上好像昨天  你们跑来看我工作的时候012---God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
我们不敢相信你们要卖掉房子012---Dad, we can't believe you're selling the house.
也该让新的家庭  在这里开始他们的新生活了012---Well, It's time for a new family to start their memories here.
我希望在支票兑现前  他们不会发现012---And hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack...
地基有裂痕  天花板的石棉瓦破了012---...in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
我们快把东西拿一拿  离开这里吧012---Let's just grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
抱歉我们不能收藏你们过时的东西012---I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
没关系  我都等不及想要再看那些东西了  所有的回忆012---Oh, it's okay. I can't wait to see everything again. All the memories.
我不知道这里放了什么012---I don't know what's in the boxes down here.
但我知道  阁楼上有六 七箱简易烘焙烤箱012---But I do know that there are six or seven Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.
我以前最喜欢玩开餐厅的游戏了012---I used to love to play restaurant.
但你最爱的还是 "吃面粉糊"012---Yeah, not as much as you loved to play "uncooked batter eater."
你不能要求小孩子  等着要电灯泡把蛋糕烤好吧012---Hey. It is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies.
我想你的箱子应该都在这里012---So I think your boxes are over here.
太棒了012---Oh, great.
嘿012---Hey...
这是谁的烟012---...Dad, whose cigarettes are these?
我不知道012---I don't know.
一定是你妈的012---They must be your mother's.
但求求你别去质问她  我来扔掉吧012---But please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
酷啊  爸  我的成绩单012---Cool. Dad, my report cards.
嘿  快来看看012---Hey, check this out. Dad.
数学 "优等"  自然"优等"  历史"优等"  体育012---Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym...
我的磨石机012---Ooh, my rock polisher.
惨了  怎么了012---Uh-oh. What?
你知道每年春天车库都会淹水吗012---You know how the garage floods every spring?
你要怎么把房子卖掉呢012---How are you ever gonna sell this place?
我想我不小心拿摩妮卡的箱子012---I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes...
来挡水  免得保时捷进了水012---...to keep the water away from the Porsche.
喔  不  爸  爸012---Oh, no, Dad. Dad?
搞什么啊012---What the--?
喔  天啊012---Oh, God.
一切都毁了012---Everything's ruined.
爸  她一定会崩溃的012---Dad, she's gonna be crushed.
你该不会是偷偷在抽烟吧012---You don't secretly smoke, do you?
没有012---No.
所以是你妈在抽烟012---So it's just your mother, then.
嗨  我是帝国办公室文具公司的菲比012---Hi. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
请问总务部经理在吗012---Can I speak to your supply manager, please?
厄尔  谢谢012---Earl. Thanks.
嗨  厄尔  我是帝国办公室  文具公司的菲比012---Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
我想跟你谈谈买碳粉的事012---I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
我不需要碳粉012---I don't need any toner.
我知道了  但是听了我们的价格  大家都会想买碳粉012---I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices, everyone needs toner.
我不要012---Not me.
能问你为什么吗012---May I ask why?
你想知道为什么012---You want to know why?
你想知道为什么012---You want to know why?
我真的很想012---I surely do.
好吧012---Okay-
我不需要碳粉012---I don't need any toner...
因为我就要自杀了012---...because I'm gonna kill myself.
嗯012---Um...
那是因为你的碳粉用完了吗012---Is that because you're out of toner?
好吧  今天我不需要碳粉  谢谢你  再见012---Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.
不  等一下  我不能让你挂电话012---No, no, wait, wait. I can't just let you hang up.
请你跟我说话012---Just please talk to me.
喔012---Well...
今天我只需要做一件事012---I only had one thing to do today.
我想我能把它延期一下吧012---I guess I could push it back.
好吧  你为什么要自杀012---Yeah. Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
十年来  我一直在做012---I've been working for 10 years now at this...
这份没有意义又没有前途的工作012---...meaningless, dead-end job...
办公室里的人根本不知道我的存在012---...and nobody here even knows that I exist.
钱德012---Chandler?
你说什么012---I'm sorry?
听着012---Oh. Look...
我相信他们都知道你的存在012---...I'm sure that people know you exist.
是吗  我在一个小房间里工作  四周都是人012---Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
我已经跟你谈了五分钟  我要自杀的问题012---I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself...
没有人抬头起来看我一眼   等一下012---...and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang on.
嘿  大伙们012---Hey, everybody, uh...
我要自杀了012---...I'm gonna kill myself.
他们不理我012---I got nothing.
好漂亮的椅子012---Good chair.
好了  如果有人问起012---Now, if anybody asks...
你的名字  就叫萝希塔012---...your name is Rosita.
可怜的小东西  她是英年早逝012---Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
乔伊  新椅子一小时内就会送来012---Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour.
或许我们该把萝希塔搬出去012---Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here, you know?
开始疗伤止痛012---Start the healing process.
好吧  我想你说的对012---Yeah, I guess you're right. Okay.
她恢复了012---She's healed.
太奇怪了  不  一点都不奇怪012---That's weird. No, it's not weird.
这是奇迹012---It's a miracle.
这不是奇迹  乔伊  我相信这一定有合理的解释012---It's not a miracle, Joey. I'm sure there's an explanation.
没错  只要你的心地纯正012---There is. If you want something enough and your heart is pure...
奇迹一定会发生012---...wondrous things can happen.
她会了解的   我不是故意的012---Well, she'll understand, right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
爸  对她来说那并不重要012---Dad, that won't matter to her.
你看  我的箱子完全没事  她的东西都012---Look, all my stuff is safe and dry. And all her stuff is...
长出新的东西了012---...growing new stuff.
就是这样的事情012---See, this is exactly the kind of thing...
才让她认为你们爱我更胜于爱她012---...that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
天啊  她真的那么认为012---Oh, my God. Does she really think that?
你能怪她吗012---Well, can you blame her?
我不知道  或许我们在潜意识里  是偏爱你的012---I don't know. I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously.
你是个奇迹012---You were a medical marvel.
医生说你妈没办法  我不想听了012---The doctors said your mom couldn't-I don't want to hear about it.
真的吗   现在不想012---Really? Well, not right now.
摩妮卡来这里要找寻回忆012---Okay, look. Monica came here for some memories.
该死的   我们得给她一些回忆啊012---Damn it, we're gonna give her some.
好吧  拿012---Okay, grab...
把空箱子拿过来  要把我的东西012---Grab some empty boxes, okay? We'll take stuff from mine...
放在这些箱子里  只要能骗过她的就行012---...and whatever we can pass off as hers, we'll put them in there.
譬如说  这个  这可能是她做的012---Right. Like, this. She could have made this.
这可能是她的  没错012---This could have been hers. Sure.
现在是告诉我那个"医学奇迹" 的012---You know, if you want to tell the medical marvel story while we work...
适当时机了012---...that'd be fine.
我好高兴能把这张椅子  留下来自己用012---I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself.
对  我也是012---Yeah. Me too.
你知道这张椅子的头垫上  还附了喇叭吗012---Wow, you know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest?
不  真的吗  没错012---No, really? Yeah.
你可以把它跟电视机接在一起  还可以听收音机012---You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio.
我的椅子有自疗的功能012---My chair heals itself.
好吧  我们别提办公室的同事了  好吗012---All right. Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay?
一定有人值得你留恋012---There's gotta be someone else in your life that's worth sticking around for.
你的家人跟朋友呢  或许你有女朋友012---What about your family or friends? Or maybe a girlfriend?
是啊012---Heh. Yeah, right.
喔  抱歉  你的男朋友呢012---Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?
好了  我应该012---Okay, I should...
去做我想做的事了012---I should probably be getting back to my thing now.
再见  不012---See you. No.
我还没有说完  你休想挂我电话012---I'm not finished yet. Don't you dare hang up on me!
新来的女同事真的有一套012---The new girl's good.
哪些箱子是我的012---So which boxes are mine?
你的箱子都在这里  好吧012---These are yours right here. Okay.
着色簿  对  是你喜欢的012---Oh, a coloring book. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you loved that thing.
你去哪里都会012---You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without--
都会带着那本着色簿012---Without that coloring book.
真的吗012---Really?
看起来我老是没办法   把颜色涂在线里面012---Wow. Looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
才不呢012---Uh-uh.
哇  你看这个012---Wow, look at this.
我不敢相信以前我穿得下这件了恤012---I can't believe I even fit into this shirt.
喔  这是你的012---Oh, this is yours.
我不知道它怎么会跑到那里去的012---I don't know how that got in there.
嘿  这不是我的东西012---Hey, this isn't my stuff.
罗斯  这些是你的箱子012---Ross, these are your boxes.
我的箱子在哪里012---Where are my boxes?
车库淹水  甜心  你的箱子都进了水012---The garage flooded, sweetie, and it ruined everything in your boxes.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
只有我的箱子进水了  恐怕是那样的012---Just mine? I'm afraid so.
为什么罗斯的东西都没坏012---So why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?
我用你的箱子挡水  来保护我的保时捷012---I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
罗斯的东西都没事  但我什么回忆都没有了012---So wait. Ross' stuff is fine, but I have no memories...
只是为了你不希望  你的汽车底盘碰到水012---...because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car from water?
水里有树叶  泥巴跟杂物012---Well, there was also leaves and gook and stuff.
我不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
去他的  我要抽根烟012---Screw it. I'm having one.
嘿  钱德  嘿012---Hey, Chandler. Hey.
你要不要试试看一张可以平躺着012---How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines...
有滚轮按摩功能012---...has a rolling massage...
头垫还附了喇叭的椅子012---...and speakers in the headrest?
是啊  我倒是喜欢  但试过很多次了012---Yeah, I'd love to, but I've tried that so many times...
他们已经不让我进他们店里了012---...they won't even let me in the store anymore.
如果我说  你可以到我家试坐一下呢012---Well, what if I told you that you could do it in my apartment?
你是说012---Are you telling me...
你买了那张  让其他椅子都变成废物的椅子012---...that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete?
那张《椅子杂志》封为  "年度最佳椅子"的椅子012---The chair that Sit Magazine called "Chair of the Year"?
我刚刚买了012---I just purchased...
懒男孩E倾斜3000型012---...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.
喔  真的是太棒了  太帅了  你为什么会买呢012---Well, that's awesome. That's great. What made you do it?
说来话长  是我弄坏了乔伊的椅子012---Well, it's a long story, but I broke Joey's chair--
哇  是你弄坏了乔伊的椅子012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. You broke Joey's chair?
我还以为是我干的012---Yeah. I thought I broke Joey's chair.
所以我用我的椅子跟它调了包012---That's why I replaced it with mine. Oh.
所以它才会恢复了012---That's how it got fixed.
你以为呢  是妖精把它修好的012---Well, what did you think? That elves came in and fixed it?
不012---No.
是天使干的012---Angels.
我要把我的椅子拿回来012---I'm getting my chair back. Hey.
看起来它根本没有自疗功能012---Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all.
我猜这张椅子是我的了012---So I guess this chair's mine now.
乔伊  你弄坏了我的椅子012---Joey, you broke my chair!
你的椅子012---Your chair?
他以为他把它弄坏了  所以他调换了椅子012---Yeah, he thought he broke your chair, so he switched the chairs.
奇迹根本不存在  没错  乔伊  奇迹不存在012---So there was no miracle? No, Joe. No miracle.
喔  不  这真的是太糟糕了012---Oh, no. This is devastating.
我的信念被击垮了012---My faith is shaken.
我很高兴  这张新椅子能陪我走过这一切012---I'm so glad I have the new chair to get me through this difficult time in my life.
请问  厄尔在哪里012---Excuse me, could you tell me where can I find Earl?
他是总务部经理012---He's the supply manager here.
抱歉  我不认识厄尔012---Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
我就在这里012---I'm right here!
厄尔012---Earl?
我是菲比  菲比012---I'm Phoebe. Phoebe?
卖碳粉的小姐012---The lady who sells toner?
听着  你不能自杀012---Um, look, you can't kill yourself.
我很感激你能赶过来012---Look, urn, I really appreciate you coming down--
不  不  我不能让你那么做012---No, no, I can't let you do it.
为什么012---Why?
因为命运让我今天打电话给你012---Because it was fate that made me call you today.
我还以为你打电话来是要卖碳粉012---I thought it was toner.
好好想一想吧  好吗  这根本不是我的正职012---No. Think about it, okay? This isn't even my regular job, okay?
我第一天上班  第一个电话就打给你012---And my first day on the job, you're my first call.
其他人可能会挂掉电话   但我不会那么做012---And somebody else might have hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that...
因为我了解这种事012---...because I know about this stuff.
我妈是自杀的  真的吗012---My morn killed herself. Really?
她怎么自杀的012---Yes. How?
我才不会教你呢012---I'm not gonna give you tips.
你看不出来吗012---Look, don't you see that this--?
这些都是命中注定的  所以才有我来阻止你自杀012---This all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
难道不是巧合吗  不  这是命中注定012---Couldn't it just be a coincidence? No, it's fate.
看起来不像是命中注定012---It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
喔  好吧  好吧  有件事很奇怪012---Oh, well. Um, okay, here's a weird thing.
