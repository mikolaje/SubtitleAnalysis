哦，唔，耶012---Oh. Um, yeah.
有事012---May we help you?

呃，嗨，呃，我们室友要拆圣诞灯…012---Uh, hi, uh, my friend was taking down our Christmas lights...
结果跌下阳台 好像伤到脚还是脚踝了012---...and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle.
天啊，到现在你们家 圣诞灯还没拆012---My God, you still have your Christmas lights up?
填好后缴回来012---Fill this out and bring it back.

对012---Yeah.
你真好012---Oh, that is so sweet.
我爱你012---Oh, gosh. I love you.
保险012---Okay, insurance?
打勾 我要理赔012---Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely gonna want some of that.
你没有任何保险？012---You don't have insurance?
为什么要有 这要花多少钱啊？012---Why? How much is this gonna cost?
不知道，但光照X光 就可能要几百块012---I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
- 那要怎么办  - 那就什么也办不了了012---- What are we gonna do? - There's not much we can do.
不然用你的012---Uh, unless I use yours.
不行012---No, no, no, no, no.
等等012---Well, now, wait a second.
刚才我紧急电话填谁012---Who did I just put as my "in case of emergency" person?
这是诈领保险金额012---That's insurance fraud.
好吧，别管了 那就回家012---Well, all right, then. Forget it. Might as well just go home.
- 哦 - 好的012---- Ow, ow, ow, ow! - Okay, okay.
- 好吧，过来，讨厌 - 谢谢，我爱你012---- Okay, come here. I hate this. - Thank you. I love you.
给我一份新表格012---Hi, heh. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms.
为什么012---Why?
我好笨012---I am really an idiot.
我帮我朋友填表格012---You see, I was filling out my friend's form...
但却填错了012---...and instead of putting her information...
填成我自己的012---...I put mine.
你真笨012---You are an idiot.
没错，我是 我真够笨的012---Yep, that's me. Heh. I am that stupid.
昨晚我梦到自己 跟儿子打美式足球012---I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
好甜蜜012---- That's nice. - That's nice.
不，是把他当成球012---No, no. With him.
我人在球场上 他们把小孩丢给我012---I'm on this field, and they hike me the baby.
《坦帕湾队》的防守球员直朝我冲来 我非采取行动不可012---I know I've gotta do something because the Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me.
《坦帕湾队》很差012---Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
是没错，但…012---Right, but...
我这队只有我和小孩 他们应该可以征服我们012---...it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinking they can take us.
所以我就…012---And so I, uh, heh...
把小孩扔到对方场地012---I just heave it downfield.
你疯了不成 那是小孩子耶012---What are you, crazy? That's a baby.
难不成要他被对方撞倒？012---He should take the sack?
总之… 突然间我来到对方场地012---Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.
这下换我要接住小孩了，对吧012---And I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right?
但我根本不可能来得及012---Only I know there's no way I'm not gonna get there in time.
所以我就一直跑012---So I am running and I'm running...
这时我却醒来了012---...and that is when I woke up.
我真的还没准备好 要当父亲012---See, I am so not ready to be a father.
你没问题的012---Hey, you're gonna be fine.
你是整个北美洲最细心 最有责任感的男人012---You're one of the most caring, responsible men in North America.
你会是好爸爸012---You're gonna make a great dad.
对，罗斯，你和宝宝只需要 有个好的阻档012---Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
有人到过彩虹屋吗  很贵吗012---Oh. Have either of you ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?
有叫餐的话012---Only if you order stuff.
我今晚要带乌苏拉去 今天她生日012---I'm taking Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
- 那菲比生日怎么办  - 她什么时候生日012---- Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday? - When's that?
今晚啊012---...tonight.
怎么这么巧012---Ugh, man, what are the odds of that happening?
你慢慢想012---You take your time.
对喔012---There it is.
你怎么打算012---So, what are you gonna do?
能怎么办  我不想搞砸和乌苏拉这边的事012---What can I do? I don't want to screw it up with Ursula.
那你的朋友菲比就可以吗012---And your friend Phoebe?
是真的朋友就能谅解啊 你们不就会这样012---If she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. Wouldn't you guys?
老兄，要是我生日 你给我搞这套012---Man, if you tried that on my birthday...
那你准备看我发飙吧012---...you'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit.
加一小撮番红花 会起很大作用012---You add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
好012---Okay, uh...
- 摩妮卡 - 是012---- Monica? - Yes?
- 对，是她 - 好012---Yes, she is.
这是我朋友瑞秋012---- Hi. This is my friend Rachel. - Hi.
瑞秋 我是米契尔大夫012---Hi, uh, Rachel, I'm Dr. Mitchell.
我是他朋友罗森大夫012---And I'm his friend Dr. Rosen.
你这样当大夫 会不会太可爱了点012---Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
抱歉012---Excuse me?
我是说年轻012---God, young, young. I meant young, heh.
当大夫年轻了点012---Young to be a doctor.
- 说的好，瑞秋 - 谢谢012---- Oh, good, Rach. - Thank you.
是的012---Right.
只是扭到 没什么012---So he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
糗事你没说012---Uh, you left out the stupid part.
不糗啦012---It's not stupid.
这两位师医生明晚要 跟我们约会，我答应了012---The very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes.
太疯狂了 他们可是在那家医院上班012---I think it's totally insane. I mean, they work for the hospital.
这简直就像回到 犯罪现场一样012---It's like returning to the scene of the crime.
- 我们别去约会了 - 啥 摩妮卡 他们又帅012---- I say we blow off the dates. - What? Monica, they are cute.
又是医生，帅医生 是医生又很帅012---They are doctors. Cute doctors. Doctors who are cute.
好，到目前 我们知道什么012---All right, what have we learned so far?
天啊012---Oh, my...

看到蓓蒂吗012---Did you see Betty?
跟你说吧 我不介意投资 生产蕃茄干产业012---I tell you, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried-tomato business.
五年前要是有人跟我说 我们可以让蕃茄变枣干012---Five years ago, if somebody'd said to me, "Here's a tomato that looks like a prune"...
我会说 给我滚出去012---...I'd have said, "Get out of my office."
爸，我出生前 你有很紧张吗012---Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
我没紧张 我只是说…012---I'm not freaking out. I'm just saying...
要是有人来跟我说012---...if someone had come to me with the idea...
爸，我是在说 生小孩的事012---Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm talking about the whole, uh, baby thing.
你有过那种012---Did you, uh, ever get this sort of...
为人父恐慌症吗012---...panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
没012---No.
你妈很尽责 我全心冲事业012---Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business.
我不常在家012---I wasn't around that much.
你讲半天是要讲这个吗012---Is that what this is about?
不是啦，爸 我只是在想012---No, no, Dad. I was just wondering.
还来得及弥补 我可以陪你做些事012---There's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together.
你一直说想去威廉斯堡 就去那好了012---You always wanted to go to colonial Williamsburg. How about we do that?
谢了，爸012---Thanks, Dad. Really, heh.
我只是012---You know, I just, I just...
我只是想弄清楚012---I just needed to know, um...
你是何时才觉得 自己已经当爸了012---...when did you start to feel like a father?
好像是你出生第二天012---Oh. Well, I guess it must have been the day after you were born.
我和你妈在病房 你妈在睡觉012---We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep...
他们带你进房 让我抱着012---...and they brought you in and gave you to me.
你是个长得红红丑丑的东西012---You were this ugly little red thing.
突然间，你用手掐了我手指一下012---And all of a sudden, you grabbed my finger with your whole fist...
紧紧抓住012---...and you squeezed it...
抓得好牢012---...so tight.
那时我才醒悟012---And that's when I knew.
那你不想去威廉斯堡吗？012---So you don't want to go to Williamsburg?
可以啊012---We can go to Williamsburg.
吃鱼吧012---Eat your fish.

摩妮卡 别这么没用好吗012---Monica, would you stop being such a wuss?
没用 我头脑清楚 有错吗012---A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world.
- 所以呢  - 她们还是很正常012---- So? - So they still seem normal.
因为她们本来就很正常012---That's because they are.
承认吧 每次跟医院病人约会都…012---You have to admit, when we go out with women we meet at the hospital...
别穷紧张  你看看身边012---Would you relax? Take a look around.
没有异教徒的圣坛012---There are no pagan altars.
角落没堆人骨012---No piles of bones in the corners.
她们没问题 跟我这样做012---They're fine. Go like this:
不能那样好吗  你有时候真的太天真012---I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a big baby.
- 我才不天真 - 真的012---- I am not a baby. - Be serious.
- 是你穷紧张 - 你有公主病012---- You get uptight... - You act like a princess.
- 你知道怎样吗  - 怎样啊012---- You know what? You know what? - What? What?
你越来越像你妈012---Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother.

我本来要嫁人了012---See, I was supposed to get married...
但临到圣坛才甩了人家012---...but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
- 真的吗  - 真的012---- Really? - Yeah.
这是有点自私啦 不过…012---Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but, heh...
我就是这样啊012---...hey, that's me.
尝尝鹰嘴豆沙拉酱吧012---- Why don't you try the hummus? RACHEL: Ahem.
摩妮卡 你是从事什么行业012---So, Monica, what do you do?
我是上流餐厅的大厨012---Uh, I am a, uh, chef at a restaurant uptown.
- 好厉害 - 没错012---- Oh, good for you. - Yeah, it is.
因为我可以对人颐指气使 正好是我的嗜好012---Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
沙拉酱好好吃012---Well, this hummus is great.
天佑鹰嘴豆012---God bless the chickpea.
