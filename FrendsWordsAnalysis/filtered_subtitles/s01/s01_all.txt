《老友记》  第一季  第1集  序集012---Friends S01E01: The Pilot
没什么好说的！他只不过是我的同事012---There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.
少来了，和你交往的男人…012---Come on. You're going out with a guy.
多多少少一定有点问题！012---There's gotta be something wrong with him.
他既驼背又戴假发？012---So does he have a hump and a hair piece?
等一下，他是不是会吃粉笔？012---Wait. Does he eat chalk?
我只是不希望你 重蹈我和卡尔的覆辙012---I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl. Oh.
各位放轻松，这不算约会012---Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.
不过是两个人一起出去吃晚餐 而且不上床012---It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
对我来说这就是约会012---Sounds like a date to me.
做了个梦，在中学时代 我站在餐厅中央…012---I'm back in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria...
突然发现自己全身赤裸012---...and I realize I'm totally naked.
- 对，没错 - 我做过那样的梦012---- Oh, yeah. - I've had that dream.
我低头一看，看见有一个电话…012---Then I look down and I realize there is a phone...
在那里012---...there.
- 而不是… - 没错012---- Instead of... - That's right!
- 我没做过那样的梦 - 没有012---MONICA: That one, I've never had. PHOEBE: No.
突然，那个电话响了012---All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
结果是我妈妈打来的012---And it turns out it's my mother.
这非常奇怪 因为她从来都不会打电话给我！012---Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
嗨012---Hi.
这家伙说〝嗨〞的时候 我却想杀了我自己012---This guy says "hello," I wanna kill myself.
你还好吧，亲爱的？012---Are you okay, sweetie?
我就感觉好像某人伸手进我的喉咙 抓住我的小肠，从我的嘴里拉出来012---I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...
- 再在我的脖子上打结… - 要吃饼干吗？012---...and tied it around my neck. - Cookie?
卡萝今天搬走了她的东西012---Carol moved her stuff out today.
哦012---PHOEBE & JOEY: Oh.
- 我给你拿杯咖啡 - 谢谢012---- Let me get you some coffee. - Thanks.
呃012---Ew. Unh.
不，不要！ 不要清理我的光环！012---No. No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.
不要管我的光环，好吗？012---Just leave my aura alone, okay?
我会没事的，好吗？真的 我希望她开心012---I'll be fine. All right? Really. I hope she'll be very happy.
- 不，你并不希望 - 是的，我不希望！012---- No, you don't. - No, I don't.
叫她去死，是她离开了我！012---To hell with her. She left me!
你从来都不知道她是女同性恋012---And you never knew she was a lesbian.
不知道！行了吧！012---No! Okay?
为什么每个人老是要提出来？012---Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
她都不知道，我又怎么会知道？012---She didn't know. How should I know?
有时候我希望我是女同性恋…012---Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
我讲得很大声吗？012---Did I say that out loud?
没事的，罗斯 你现在感到很痛苦012---All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
你很生气，很伤心012---You're angry. You're hurting.
我能告诉你解决方法是什么吗？012---Can I tell you what the answer is?
脱衣舞厅！012---Strip joints!
别这样，你单身了！有需求的！012---Come on, you're single. Have some hormones.
我不想单身，好吗？012---See, but I don't want to be single, okay?
我只想…再次结婚！012---I just wanna be married again.
而我只想要一百万美金！012---And I just want a million dollars!
瑞秋！012---Rachel?
噢，老天爷，摩妮卡 感谢上帝！012---Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!
我刚到你那里去，而你不在 那个拿着大锤子的家伙说012---I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said...
你可能在这里 你真在这里！012---...that you might be here, and you are.
- 你想喝点咖啡吗？ - 无咖啡因的012---- Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf.
好了，各位，这位是瑞秋 另一个林肯高中的幸存者012---Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
这就是各位 这是钱德、菲比012---This is everybody. This is Chandler and Phoebe...
乔伊，还有 你还记得我哥哥罗斯吗？012---...and Joey. And remember my brother, Ross?
- 当然，嘿！ - 嘿012---- Sure! - Hey.
- 嗨 - 天啊012---- Hi. - Oh, God.
那你现在可以告诉我们了吗 还是说我们在等着四位湿漉的伴娘?012---So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
好吧，大概在婚礼前半个小时012---Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
我在礼物间里012---I was in this room with all the presents...
看着那个肉汁壶012---...and I was looking at this gravy boat.
那是个非常好看的肉汁壶012---This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
然后，突然…　有代糖吗？012---When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?
我发现…012---- I realized...
我对这个肉汁壶 比对巴瑞更有冲动！012---...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.
然后我吓呆了 然后这个想法突然出现在脑中：012---Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:
巴瑞看起来多像洋芋头先生啊012---How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
我总是觉得他眼熟，但是…012---You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...
总之 我必须离开那里，我在想：012---Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:
〝我为什么这样做，我为谁这样做？〞012---"Why am I doing this?" And "Who am I doing this for?"
我不知道该去哪里 而且我知道我和你有点疏远了012---Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...
但你是我这个城市里唯一认识的人012---...but you're the only person I know in the city.
而且没有受邀参加你的婚礼012---Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
噢，我希望你不会把它当一回事…012---Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
我猜他给她买了个管风琴012---I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ...
而她很不喜欢那个012---...and she's really not happy about it.
老爸，我就是无法和他结婚012---Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我只是不爱他了012---I just don't love him.
这对我很有关系！012---Well, it matters to me.
她真不应该穿那条裤子012---CHANDLER: She should not be wearing those pants.
我觉得应该把她推下楼012---I say push her down the stairs.
把她推下楼…012---ALL: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
爸爸，听我说！012---Come on, Daddy, listen to me!
这就好像在我一生中 所有人都告诉我：〝你是鞋子！〞012---It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe!
〝你是鞋子…〞012---You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!"
然后今天，我停下来对自己说： 〝如果我不想成为鞋子呢？012---Then today I stopped and said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
如果我想成为一个包包？012---What if I wanna be a purse? You know?
或一顶帽子？〞012---Or a hat?"
不，我不是要你给我买帽子 我是说我是帽子012---I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat.
这是个比喻，爸爸！012---It's a metaphor, Daddy!
你看得出他哪里听不懂012---You can see where he'd have trouble.
爸爸，这是我的生活012---Look, Daddy, it's my life.
也许我可以和摩妮卡住在一起012---Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
我猜我们已经确定 她要和摩妮卡住在一起了…012---I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.
也许那是我的决定012---Well, maybe that's my decision.
也许我不需要你的钱012---Well, maybe I don't need your money.
等等！我说也许！012---Wait! Wait! I said maybe!
呼吸，呼吸 好，就这样012---Okay. Just breathe, that's it.
试着想一些让你镇定的事…012---Just try to think of nice, calm things.
玫瑰上的雨滴，还有猫的胡须012---Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens
门铃和雪橇铃，还有手套…012---Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens
啦啦啦，还有一些条状物…012---La la la something With string
我现在好多了012---I'm all better now.
我帮上忙啦012---I helped.
瞧，这也许对你来讲是最好的 知道吗？012---MONICA: Look, this is probably for the best, you know?
独立了，把握自己的生活012---Independence. Taking control of your life.
还有，你还需要什么 你可以随时来找乔伊012---And, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to Joey.
我和钱德就住在对面 而且他经常不在012---Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.
乔伊，不要再对她放电了 今天是她结婚的日子！012---Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.
怎么啦，难道这还有什么规定吗？012---What? Like there's a rule or something?
请不要再按了 那是很恐怖的声音012---Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.
- 我是保罗 - 让他进来！012---PAUL: Uh, it's Paul. - Buzz him in.
- 谁是保罗？ - 保罗，红酒达人，保罗？012---- Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy, Paul?
也许012---Maybe.
等等，你今晚的〝不是真正约会〞 是和红酒达人保罗？012---Wait a minute. Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy?
- 他终于约你出去啦？ - 是的！012---- He finally asked you out? - Yes.
真是个可以写入日记的时刻012---Ooh. This is a "Dear Diary" moment.
瑞秋，等等，我可以取消…012---Rach, wait, I can cancel.
不用 你去吧，我不会有事的！012---Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.
罗斯，你没事吧？ 你希望我留下来吗？012---Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
能留下就太好了…012---That'd be good.
- 真的？ - 不，去吧！那可是红酒达人保罗耶！012---- Really? - No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.
进来，保罗，这是…012---MONICA: Hi, come in. Paul, this is...
大家 各位，这是保罗012---...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.
保罗！红酒达人！012---JOEY: Paul, the wine guy.
- 红酒达人！ - 我没听清楚你的名字，是保罗吗？012---- Wine guy. - I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
- 请坐，两秒钟就好 - 好012---- Okay. Sit down. Two seconds. - Okay.
我刚拔掉四根睫毛不是个好兆头012---Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
那么瑞秋，你今晚…打算做什么？012---So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight?
我本来应该到阿鲁巴度蜜月012---Well, I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon...
所以，没事做！012---...so, nothing.
对呀，你连蜜月都无法去012---Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.
不过，阿鲁巴，这个时候？012---God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh. This time of year? Eh.
你可以谈论一下…012---Talk about your...
大蜥蜴012---...big lizards.
总之 如果今晚你不想自己一个人的话012---Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight...
乔伊和钱德要过来 帮我组装我的新家具012---...Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.
对，而且我们为此感到兴奋012---Yes, and we're very excited about it.
谢谢了，不过我想今晚 还是留在这里吧012---Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.
- 今天真是漫长的一天 - 是呀，好吧012---- It's been a long day. - Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.
菲比，你要来帮忙吗？012---Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?
噢，我希望我能，但是我不想012---Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
我应该把支架固定在侧面012---I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things...
用螺纹蜗轮012---...using a bunch of these little worm guys.
我没有支架，没有看到螺纹蜗轮012---I have no bracket-y thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever...
而且我的腿麻了012---...and I cannot feel my legs.
这是什么？012---What's this?
我不知道012---I have no idea.
- 搞定书架了！ - 完工了！012---- Done with the bookcase. - All finished.
这是卡萝最喜欢的啤酒012---This was Carol's favorite beer.
她总是直接从罐子喝，我该知道的012---She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.
罗斯，我来问你一个问题012---Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.
她得到家具、音响、超赞的电视…012---She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.
那你得到了什么？012---What did you get?
你们啊012---You guys.
- 天呀 - 你被耍了012---- Oh, God. Oh, my God. - You got screwed.
- 我的老天！ - 我知道，我真是个笨蛋012---- Oh, my God. - I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.
当她一个礼拜见四、五次牙医 我就该知道了012---I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.
谁的牙齿需要这么干净？012---I mean, how clean can teeth get?
我哥哥正在克服这种事呢 他真是一团糟012---My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.
你是怎么克服的？012---How did you get through it?
他可以试着砸烂她的一些贵重的东西012---He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.
- 比如她的… - 腿？012---- Say her... - Leg?
那样也可以！012---Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah.
我则是砸了她的手表012---Me, I went for the watch.
你真的砸了她的手表？012---- You actually broke her watch? - Mm.
巴瑞，对不起，对不起012---Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
我知道你可能认为和那天我对你说 跟你穿袜子做爱有关，但不是的012---You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.
这和我有关，我只是…012---It isn't, it's about me. And I...
嘿，机器又把电话挂断了 不管怎样…012---Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway...
知道什么最吓人的吗？ 如果每个人只有一个女人适合他呢？012---You know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody?
我是说 如果你得到一个女人，就这样012---I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?
不幸的是，以我的例子来讲 是她…得到一个女人012---Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.
你在说什么？ 〝一个女人〞？012---What are you talking about? One woman.
那就好像你只吃一种口味的冰淇淋012---That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.
让我告诉你，罗斯 还有很多种口味012---Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there.
有碎糖口味、饼干口味 然后还有香草口味012---There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.
还可以加糖条、果仁 或者鲜奶油一起吃！012---You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.
这是你一生中最棒的时刻了！012---This is the best thing that ever happened to you.
你难道是八岁结婚的？012---You got married. You were like, what, 8?
欢迎回到现实里！拿起汤匙！012---Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.
我真不知道我是饿了 还是饥渴012---I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
离我的冰箱远点！012---Then stay out of my freezer.
从她离开我之后，我…012---Ever since she walked out on me, I...
怎么啦？012---What? What?
你想边吃面条边讲出来？012---You wanna spell it out with noodles?
不，这本该在和你 第五次约会时才能说出来的012---No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.
噢，所以会有第五次约会罗？012---Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?
会有吗？012---Isn't there?
我觉得会有012---Yeah, yeah. I think there is.
你要说什么？012---What were you gonna say?
好吧012---Well... Er, uh...
自从她离开我之后…012---Ever since she left me, um...
我就一直…012---...I haven't been able to perform...
无法行房012---...sexually.
天啊，对不起012---Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...
- 对不起… - 没关系012---- I'm so sorry. - It's okay.
被人吐水应该不是你现在需要的012---Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
唔…012---Um...
多久了？012---How long?
两年012---Two years.
哇！012---Wow!
我真高兴你砸了她的手表！012---I'm glad you smashed her watch.
那你还希望有第五次约会吗？012---So you still think you might want that fifth date?
是的012---Yeah.
是的，我希望012---Yeah, I do.
我乔安妮接受查理斯为我的合法丈夫012---I, Joanie, take you, Charles, as my lawful husband.
- 你是否接受乔安妮… - 看吧012---MINISTER: Do you take Joanie...? - Oh! See.
可是乔安妮爱佳奇！就是这里不同！012---But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.
〝拿起汤匙〞012---"Grab a spoon."
你知道我多久没拿汤匙了吗？012---Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?
〝比利，别逞英雄〞 这句话对你有没有意义？012---Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you?
是这样的，就算我想…012---You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough...
约一个女人出来012---...to ask a woman out...
我该约谁？012---...who am I gonna ask?
是不是很不可思议？012---Isn't this amazing?
我以前从来没泡过咖啡012---I mean, I have never made coffee before in my life.
- 是很不可思议 - 恭喜你012---- That is amazing. - Congratulations.
你现在刚好有心情 有没有想做个蛋饼之类的东西…012---While you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...
不过我还不太饿…012---Although, actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.
- 早安 - 早安012---- Good morning. MONICA: Good morning.
- 早安  - 早安012---- Morning.  - JOEY: Morning.
- 早安 - 早安，保罗012---- Morning. JOEY: Morning, Paul.
- 你好，保罗 - 嘿，是保罗，对吗？012---- Hello, Paul. - Hi. Paul, is it?
我昨晚很开心012---MONICA: I had a really great time last night.
谢谢你!太感谢你了!012---PAUL: Thank you. Thank you so much.
- 再聊 - 好的012---- We'll talk later, okay? - Yeah.
谢谢012---Thank you.
那不是真正的约会！012---That wasn't a real date.
那你真正的约会都在干什么？012---What the hell do you do on a real date?
- 闭嘴，把我的桌子搬回去 - 好的！012---- Shut up and put my table back. JOEY: Okay.
好啦，孩子们，我要去工作啦012---All right, kids, I gotta get to work.
不过如果我不把那些数字输入 也不会有什么差别012---If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.
你们都有工作吗？012---So, like, you guys all have jobs?
对，我们都有012---Yeah, we all have jobs.
这样我们才有钱买东西012---See, that's how we buy stuff.
对，我是演员012---Yeah, I'm an actor.
哇，我有见过你的作品吗？012---Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?
哦，应该没有，大部分是地方性节目012---Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
等等，除非你看过 翻拍的《木偶奇遇记》012---Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.
〝瞧，老木匠，我是个真正的小男孩〞012---"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."
别这样羞辱我012---I will not take this abuse.
没错，对不起012---You're right. I'm sorry.
我曾经是个小木偶…012---Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy
你今天怎么样？睡得好吗？012---MONICA: So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
和巴瑞谈过吗?我无法停止微笑012---Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
看得出来，就好像你睡觉时 有个衣架在你嘴里012---I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
我知道，他只是太…012---I know. He's just so...
你还记得你和托尼多马哥吗？012---Remember you and Tony De Marco?
- 是的，记得 - 就好像那样，但有感觉012---- Oh, yeah. - Well, it's like that. With feelings.
哇，你有麻烦了012---Oh, wow, are you in trouble!
好，我要醒过来，去工作012---Okay, okay. I am just going to get up, go to work...
而且不要整天想着他012---...and not think about him all day.
或者只是站起来去工作012---Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
- 喔，祝我好运！ - 为什么？012---- Oh, wish me luck! - What for?
我要去找工作之类的事012---I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
嘿，摩妮卡！ 嘿，弗兰妮，欢迎回来！012---- Hey, Monica. - Hey, Franny. Welcome back.
佛罗里达怎么样？012---How was Florida?
你跟人上床了，对吧？012---You had sex, didn't you?
你怎么知道的012---How do you do that?
- 那么，是和谁？ - 你认识保罗吗？012---- So, who? - You know Paul?
保罗，红酒达人？012---Paul, the wine guy?
是的，我认识保罗012---Oh, yeah, I know Paul.
你认识他就好像我认识他一样？012---You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?
你开玩笑吧？保罗还欠我人情呢012---Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.
在我之前，他两年都无法行房012---Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
那当然是谎言！012---Of course it was a line.
为什么？为什么有人会做这样的事情？012---Why? Why would anybody do something like that?
我想更精确的答案是012---We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than:
〝为了和你上床〞012---"To get you into bed."
是因为我吗？012---Is it me?
是因为我会散发某种信号吗？012---Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs...
只有狗和有感情问题的男人 才会成应到？012---...and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
好啦，过来这里，把你的脚给我012---All right, come here. Give me your feet.
我只是以为他是个好人012---I just thought he was nice, you know?
我真不敢相信 你不知道那是谎言！012---I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
猜猜怎么样？012---Guess what.
- 你找到工作啦？ - 开玩笑吗？012---- You got a job? - Are you kidding?
我一点经验都没有！012---I'm trained for nothing.
我今天被十二个面试员嘲笑012---I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.
而且你还这么高兴012---Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
你也会高兴的 如果你发现名牌皮靴特价…012---Well, you would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale...

每次他们来这里，你不会看到罗斯 神经兮兮的，非常可怕012---You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

- 对 - 好吧，听着012---- Oh, yeah. MONICA: Okay, look.
你最后一次戴上它 是什么时候的事？012---When did you have it on last?
或许就在她把它弄丢之前012---Doy. Probably right before she lost it.

好吧012---Okay.
哦012---Oh!
- 罗斯 - 这应该怎么做才好？012---- Ross. - So, um...? So how's this going to work...
我是说我们012---...ahem, you know, with us?
譬如说得做出重要决定时012---You know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
举个例子来听听012---Give me a "for instance."
我不知道，好吧012---Well, I don't know. Okay, okay.
- 宝宝的名字呢？ - 马龙012---- How about with the baby's name? - Marlon...
- 马龙 - 如果是儿子，女子就叫米妮012---- Marlon. ...if it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.
跟米妮老鼠一样？012---As in "Mouse"?
跟我奶奶一样？012---As in my grandmother.
但提到米妮，大家会想到米妮老鼠012---Still, you say "Minnie," you hear "Mouse."
何不叫…012---How about, um...
何不叫茱莉亚呢？012---How about "Julia"?
茱莉亚？012---Julia.
我们同意叫米妮了012---We agreed on Minnie.
那真的很有趣 我们同意要共度一生012---It's funny, um, we agreed we'd spend our lives together.
事情变了，我们可以用拳头来决定012---Things change. Roll with the punches.
我相信茱莉亚是个好名字012---I believe Julia's on the table.
对不起012---Oh. Sorry about that.
你还好吧？012---So, what have you been up to?
还算可以012---Oh. Not much.
- 我找到工作了 - 那真的很棒012---- I got a job. - Hey, that's great.
为什么你皮肤变得这么黑？012---Why are you so tan?
我…012---Oh, I, uh...
我去了阿鲁巴012---I went to Aruba.
不，你一个人去度我们的蜜月？012---Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
不012---No.
听着，我跟…012---See, uh, I went with...
- 这或许会有点痛 - 我吗？012---- Now, this may hurt. - Me?
不是012---No.
我跟敏蒂去的012---I went with Mindy.
敏蒂？012---Mindy?
我的伴娘敏蒂？012---My maid of honor, Mindy?
对，我们在交往012---Yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.
我…012---Well, I'm...
你做了植发012---You got plugs.
小心，它们还没有完全固定012---Careful, careful. They haven't quite taken yet.
你戴了隐形眼镜012---And you got lenses.
你讨厌把手指戳到眼睛里012---But you hate sticking your finger in your eye.
为了她，没关系的012---Not for her.
哦012---Oh.
听着，我真的想谢谢你012---Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
好的012---Okay.
一个月前我想伤害你012---About a month ago, I wanted to hurt you...
你是我最想伤害的人012---...more than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life.
我是牙齿矫正师012---And I'm an orthodontist.
哇012---Wow.
你说得对，我以为我们很快乐012---You know, you were right. I mean, I thought we were happy.
我们不快乐012---We weren't happy.
可是跟敏蒂在一起012---But with Mindy...
现在我很快乐012---...now I'm happy.
- 吐吧 - 什么？012---- Spit. - What?
是我012---Me.
总之…012---Anyway, um...
我想这该还给你012---I guess, uh... I guess this belongs to you.
谢谢你把它送给我012---And thank you for giving it to me.
谢谢你把它还给我012---Well, thank you for giving it back.
哈罗012---Hello.
拜托，海伦有什么不好？012---Oh, please. What's wrong with Helen?
海伦·盖勒？012---Helen Geller?
- 我不觉得好 - 哈罗，宝宝不叫海伦·盖勒012---- I don't think so. - Hello, it's not gonna be Helen Geller.
谢谢012---Thank you.
不，我是说宝宝不姓盖勒012---No. I mean, it's not Geller.
什么？宝宝叫海伦·威利克？012---What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
不，事实上她叫海伦·威利克·邦奇012---No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.
等一下，为什么这跟她有关？012---Well, wait a minute. Why is she in the title?
因为这也是我的宝宝012---Because it's my baby too.
那太好笑了，真的吗？ 我不记得你会制造精子012---That's funny. Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.
我们都知道那是个多大的挑战012---And we all know what a challenge that is.
- 看吧 - 好了，你们两个，别说了012---- Uh-huh. See? - All right, you two, stop it.
不，她有功劳，我也是012---No, no. She gets a credit. Hey, I'm in there too.
说真的，宝宝不能叫 海伦·威利克·邦奇·盖勒012---Honestly. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick Bunch Geller.
我想那跟虐童差不多012---I think that borders on child abuse.
当然不是 我想宝宝叫盖勒·威利克·邦奇012---Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.
不，你知道他在做什么吗？012---Oh, no. No, no, no. You see what he's doing?
他知道没有人会那样叫她012---He knows no one is gonna say all those names.
最后他们会叫她盖勒 那样子他就达到目的了012---He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller. Then he gets his way.
我的目的？你觉得这是我的目的？012---My way? You think this is my way?
相信我，目前我想像过的生活012---Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being...
绝对不包括这一点 你知道吗？这真的太难了012---...this is not my way. You know what? This is too hard.
还好吗？有恶心的感觉吗？012---Knock, knock. How are we today? Any nausea?
- 有一点 - 只有一点012---- A little. - Just a little.
我是指准妈妈的感觉 不过谢谢你们跟我分享012---Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.
躺好012---Uh, lie back.
你知道吗？我要走了012---You know what? I'm gonna go.
我想我无法介入这种家务事012---Um, I don't think I can be involved in this particular family thing.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
看看那个012---Look at that.
我知道012---I know.
那真的很神奇吧？012---Well, isn't that amazing?
我们到底要看什么？012---What are we supposed to be seeing here?
我不知道 我想那跟攻击企业号有关012---I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
如果你们的头往左斜，眼睛放轻松012---You know, if you tilt your head to the left and relax your eyes...
它看起来像颗马铃薯012---...it kind of looks like an old potato.
别那么做，好吗？012---Then don't do that, all right?
摩妮卡012---Monica?
你觉得呢？012---What do you think?
嗯-哼012---Mm-hm.
你哭了吗？012---Are you welling up?
- 不 - 才怪012---- No. - You are.
- 才怪，你哭了 - 不，我才没有012---- You are. You're welling up. - No, I'm not.
- 你要当姑姑了 - 闭嘴012---- You're gonna be an aunt. - Oh, shut up.
敏蒂012---Hi, Mindy.
我是瑞秋012---Hi, it's Rachel.
对，我很好，今天我跟贝瑞见面012---Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.
对，他跟我说了012---Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.
不，没关系，真的012---No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.
我希望你们两个快乐，真的012---I hope you two are very happy. I really do.
小敏，如果一切顺利012---And, Min, you know, if everything works out...
你们会结婚生孩子012---...and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything...
我希望他们遗传了他的发线 跟你的鼻子012---...I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.
好吧，我知道那么做很低级 但现在我觉得痛快多了012---Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
- 大家好 - 菲比012---- Hi, guys. JOEY: Hey, Phoebe.
情况如何？012---Hey, oh, how did it go?
不是太好012---Um, not so good.
他送我到地铁站 并且说〝我们该再这么做〞012---He walked me to the subway and said, "We should do this again."
什么？他说〝我们该再这么做〞012---- Ouch. - What? He said, "We should do it again."
那是件好事吧012---That's good, right?
不，简单地翻译 〝我们该再这么做〞是指012---Uh, no. Loosely translated, "We should do this again," means:
〝你再也看不到我的裸体〞012---"You will never see me naked."
从什么时候开始？012---Since when?
一直都是这样，那是种约会语言012---Since always. It's, like, dating language.
〝那与你无关〞 意思是〝全都是你的错〞012---You know, like, "It's not you," means, "It is you."
〝你是个好人〞意思是012---"You're such a nice guy," means:
〝我要跟穿着皮衣的酒鬼约会012---"I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics...
跟他们抱怨你的事〞012---...and complaining about them to you."
〝我想我们该跟别人交往看看〞 意思是指012---Or, you know, um, "I think we should see other people," means:
〝我已经那么做了〞012---"Ha, ha, I already am."
大家都知道这些事？012---And everybody knows this?
对，降低冲击力012---Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.
像是你小的时候 爸妈将你的狗安乐死012---Like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep...
跟你说他逃跑到农场去了012---...and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
那真的很好笑 不，因为我们的爸妈真的…012---That's funny. No, because, uh, our parents actually did...
把我们的狗送到农场去012---...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
罗斯012---Uh, Ross?
康涅狄格州的麦纳农场？012---Ha, ha. Hello. The Milner's farm in Connecticut?
麦纳夫妇有座超棒的农场012---The Milners, they had this unbelievable farm.
他们养了马跟兔子 他可以追着他们玩012---They had horses and rabbits that he could chase.
那是…012---And it was...
天啊，奇奇012---Oh, my God. Chi-Chi.
《老友记》  第一季  第3集  见友弃色012---Friends S01E03: The One with the Thumb
〝知道自己快死掉时 那是什么样的感觉？〞012---"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
典狱长，五分钟后我将不再痛苦012---Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.
但你得一辈子受到良心谴责 知道自己送一个诚实的人去死012---But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
- 那真的很不错 - 是吗？012---- Hey, that was really good. - Yeah?
- 对 - 谢了 继续吧012---- Yeah. - Thanks. Let's keep going.
好吧， 你要我怎么做？迪蒙012---Okay. "So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?"
我只想回我的牢房 因为在我的牢房里，我能抽烟012---I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell, I can smoke.
你就抽吧012---"Smoke away."
嘿012---Heh.
我想这是迪蒙 独自在牢房抽烟的原因012---I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.
- 什么？ - 手放轻松012---- What? - Relax your hand.
手腕下垂012---Let your wrist go.
- 别垂得那么低  - 哇012---- Not so much.  - Whoa.
嘿012---Hey.
好吧，试着抽一口012---All right. Now try taking a puff.
对012---Right.
- 好吧，不，快给我 - 不，我才不要给你烟012---- Okay, no, give it to me. - No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.
没关系的，听着 你要不要这个角色？来吧012---No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want to get this part or not? Here.
好吧，别当这是香烟012---All right. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.
当它是从你手里不见的东西012---Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.
拿着它，你觉得安心012---When you're holding it, you feel right.
- 你觉得圆满 - 你想念它吗？012---- You feel complete. - You miss it?
不，不是很想012---No, not so much.
好吧，现在抽一口012---All right. Now we smoke.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
不012---No, no, no.
他们说那个的长度 跟男人拇指尖012---They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb...
到食指尖的距离一样012---...to the tip of his index finger.
那太夸张了012---That's ridiculous.
我可以用另一只手的拇指吗？012---Can I use either thumb?
好吧，别告诉我012---All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.
乔伊是无咖啡因的卡布奇诺012---Decaf cappuccino for Joey.
黑咖啡012---Coffee, black.
拿铁012---Latte.
冰茶012---And an iced tea.
- 我真的很厉害 - 太好了，非常不错012---- I'm getting pretty good at this. - Excellent. That's very good.
我太神了012---Good for me.
- 你还好吧？菲比 - 对，不，那根本不值得…012---- You okay, Phoebe? - Yeah, no, it's not even worth...
是我的银行012---It's my bank.
他们对你做了什么？012---What did they do to you?
没事，只不过…好的012---It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
我看邮件时打开他们的月报表012---I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly "statement."
别激动012---Easy.
我的账户多了五百块012---And there's 500 extra dollars in my account.
撒旦的手下又发威了012---Oh, Satan's minions at work again.
对，我得去银行跟他们谈012---Yes, because now I have to go down there and deal with them...
- 你干嘛说呢？ 留下那笔钱 - 那不是我的钱012---- What are you talking about? Keep it. - It's not mine.
那不是我赚来的 留下来那笔钱就等于我偷钱012---I didn't earn it. If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
对，把它花掉，可以享受血拼乐趣012---Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.
好的012---Okay. Okay.
假设我买了一双很棒的鞋子012---Let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.
你们知道我每跨出一步 会听到什么吗？012---Do you know what I'd hear with every step I took?
〝不是我的钱〞012---"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."
即使我开心地飞舞012---And even if I was happy, okay, and skipping...
我会听到〝不是我的钱〞012---...I'd hear, "Not mine. Not mine."
我们同意你的说法，我们了解012---We're with you. We got it.
好吧，我无法享受乐趣 那是一大道德考验012---Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be like this giant karmic debt.
钱德，你在做什么？012---Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.
你在做什么？012---What are you doing?
超恶心的012---Oh, gross.
- 这是怎么一回事？ - 我在抽烟012---- What is this? - I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking.
我不相信，三年来你表现很好012---I can't believe you. You've been so good for three years.
这是我的奖励012---And this is my reward.
等一下，想想上次戒烟时你吃的苦012---Hold on a second. Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
好吧，所以这次我不戒烟012---Okay, so this time I won't quit.
- 把烟熄了 - 好吧，我熄了就是012---- Put it out. - All right. I'm putting it out.
不012---Oh, no.
现在我没办法喝咖啡了012---I can't drink this now.
好吧，我要去换衣服，我有约会012---All right, I'm gonna go change. I've got a date.
又是亚伦？情况如何？012---Is this Alan again? How's it going?
非常不错，你们知道吗？ 我们相处既愉快又开心012---It's going pretty good, you know? It's nice and we're having fun.
- 我们何时能见到这家伙？ - 对012---- So when do we get to meet the guy? ROSS: Yeah.
让我想一想，今天是星期一012---Let's see, today's Monday...
- 永远不可能 - 少来了012---- Never. - Come on.
- 不，在史提夫后是不可能了 - 你在胡说什么？012---- No, not after what happened with Steve. - What are you talking about?
我们爱史提夫，史提夫超性感012---We love Steve. Steve was sexy.
抱歉012---Sorry.
我不知道我对他有什么感觉 给我机会弄清楚012---Look, I don't know how I feel about him yet. Give me a chance to figure it out.
然后我们能跟他见面？012---Well, then can we meet him?
不行012---No.
抱歉012---Sorry.
为什么我要让他们跟他见面？012---Why should I let them meet him?
我带男人回家 五分钟内他们围着他问个不停012---I bring a guy home and within five minutes they're all over him.
他们像是土狼，专挑弱小猎物下手012---I mean, they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.
听着 对一个什么倒霉事都遇过的人来说012---Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef...
我想那不算是太糟糕012---...I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.
他们是你的朋友，他们关心你012---Come on, they're your friends. They're looking out after you.
我知道，我希望 我能带个他们喜欢的男人回家012---I know, I know. I wish that once I'd bring a guy home they actually liked.
你知道 如果他们永远不跟这个男的见面012---Well, you do realize that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer...
机率会更小的012---...if they never get to meet the guy.
算了吧，罗斯012---Let it go, Ross.
是吗？你根本不认识奇奇012---Yeah? Well, you didn't know Chi-Chi.
你们都保证吗？012---MONICA: Do you all promise?
- 对，我们保证，我们会很乖的 - 我们保证012---- Yeah, we promise. We'll be good. JOEY: We promise.
钱德，你保证会很乖吗？012---Chandler, do you promise to be good?
你可以进来，但你的烟得放在外面012---You can come in, but your filter tip little buddy has to stay outside.
菲比012---ROSS: Hey, Pheebs.
〝亲爱的布非小姐 谢谢你通知我们犯了错012---"Dear Ms. Buffay: Thank you for calling attention to our error.
我们将五百块汇到你的账户 抱歉造成你的不便012---We have credited your account $500. We're sorry for the inconvenience...
希望你收下这个足球电话012---...and hope you'll accept this football phone...
作为我们的免费礼物〞 你们能相信吗？012---...as our free gift." Do you believe this?
现在我有一千块跟这个足球电话012---Now I have $1000 and a football phone.
你在哪家银行开户？012---What bank is this?
好吧，他来了012---Okay, it's him.
- 哪位？ - 亚伦012---- Who is it? ALAN: Alan.
钱德，他来了012---Chandler. He's here.
好了，拜托你们乖一点012---Okay, please be good. Please?
记得你们有多么喜欢我012---I mean, remember how much you like me.
亚伦，他们是我的朋友 各位，他是亚伦012---Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
- 嗨 - 嘿012---- Hi. GROUP: Hey.
我常听到你们的事012---I've heard so much about all you guys.
谢谢，明天我再打电话给你012---MONICA: Thanks, I'll call you tomorrow.
好吧012---Okay.
好吧，开始批评亚伦012---Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.
谁要开第一枪？012---Who's gonna take the first shot?
嗯？012---Hmm?
来吧012---Come on.
我先来012---I'll go.
从他一直挑…012---Let's start with the way he kept picking at...
对不起，我办不到012---You know, I'm sorry, I can't do this.
我办不到，我们爱他012---Can't do it. We loved him.
- 我们爱他 - 等一下012---GROUP: We loved him. - Wait a minute.
我们在谈我的约会对象吗？012---We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
- 对 - 你们注意到了吗？012---GROUP: Yes. - And did you notice?
对012---GROUP: Yeah.
你们知道哪一点最棒吧？ 他的笑容有点坏坏的012---Know what was great? The way his smile was kind of crooked.
对，像鞋子里的男人012---Yes, yes. Like the man in the shoe.
什么鞋子？012---What shoe?
童谣里的歌词012---From the nursery rhyme.
〝有个坏男人，带着坏坏的笑容012---"There was a crooked man who had a crooked smile...
他在鞋子里住了一阵子〞012---...who lived in a shoe for a while..."
我想亚伦012---So I think Alan...
成为标杆012---...will become the yardstick...
用来评估你未来所有的男朋友012---...against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
什么未来的男朋友？012---What future boyfriends?
不，我想就是他了012---No, no. I think this could be, you know, "it."
- 真的吗？ - 对012---- Really? - Oh, yeah.
我会嫁给他，因为他的表情 跟大卫赫索霍夫一样012---I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.
你们知道我在派对上会怎么做吧？012---You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
- 你们知道我最喜欢他哪一点吗？ - 什么？012---- You know what I like most about him? - What?
他让我喜欢我自己012---The way he makes me feel about myself.
对012---ALL: Yeah.
嗨012---Hi.
比赛还好吧？012---How was the game?
那个嘛…012---Well...
- 我们赢了 - 我们赢了，谢谢，太棒了012---- We won! - We won! Thank you! Yeah.
太棒了，我有个问题 怎么可能呢？012---Fantastic. I have one question: How is that possible?
- 亚伦 - 他太不可思议了012---- Alan. - He was unbelievable.
他跟兔宝宝卡通里 每个位置都是兔宝宝一样012---He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions.
但他不是兔宝宝 - 垒，亚伦、二垒，亚伦012---But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan...
他让我们成为真正的球队012---I mean, it was like he made us into a team.
对，我们真的 让那些东正教犹太人珠宝商012---Yep. We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers...
- 知道我们多会打垒球 - 太棒了012---...a thing or two about softball. - Nice.
我能问你们一个问题吗？012---Can I ask you guys a question?
你们会不会觉得亚伦有时候…012---Do you ever think that Alan is maybe sometimes...
- 什么？ - 我不知道，有点太亚伦了012---- What? - I don't know. A little too Alan?
不，那是不可能的 他不可能会太亚伦012---Oh, no. That's not possible. You can never be too Alan.
对，我们爱的是亚伦的内在012---Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness that we adore.

对012---Yes.
我那里有一间洗衣室012---I do have a laundry room in my building.

他们显然对烘干机的芳香片 很有兴趣012---Apparently, they're attracted to the dryer sheets.
他们进去的时候都还好好的 出来的时候就…012---They're going in fine, but they're coming out all...
蓬蓬的了012---...fluffy.
总之，七点左右好吗？012---Anyway, 7-ish?
当然012---Sure.
少来，我现在跟鲍柏在一起了012---Forget it, Joey. I'm with Bob now.

他很聪明、见过世面 而且有正当工作012---He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.
你一个月试镜三次 就说自己是演员，鲍柏则…012---You go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor. But Bob...
拜托！我们在一起时很快乐012---Come on. We were great together.
不只是享乐的时候 比如说，谈话的时候也不错012---And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too.
抱歉，你说过〝我们就当朋友〞012---Sorry, Joey. You said, "Let's just be friends."
你猜结果呢？012---So guess what?
- 怎样？ - 我们就只是朋友012---- What? - We're just friends.
好吧，好吧012---Fine. Fine.
今天我们四个人 何不一块吃饭？就朋友嘛012---So why don't the four of us go out and have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

摩妮卡012---...Monica.

甭想！自从你那个打嗝天王亲戚后 我就不再相信你了012---Forget it! Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
拜托，这家伙很棒 他叫鲍柏，他是安琪拉的…012---Come on, this guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's...
兄弟012---...ahem, brother.
他很聪明又见过世面…012---He's smart, he's sophisticated...
而且他有正当工作012---...and he has a real job.
我一个月试镜三次 就说我是个演员，不过他是…012---Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
- 老天爷啊 - 干嘛？012---- Oh, God, help us. - What?
丑陋裸男在铺厨房地砖012---Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.
呕012---BOTH: Ew!
我是在请你帮忙012---Look, I'm asking a favor here.
只要我帮她兄弟这个忙012---I'm thinking if I do this for her brother...
安琪拉也许就会回到我身边012---...maybe Angela will come back to me.
你干嘛？ 你的女朋友加起来有几卡车012---What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
我知道，不过…012---I know, but...
我犯了一个大错 我不该跟她分手的012---Look, I made a huge mistake. I never should've broke up with her.
你帮帮我好吗？拜托？012---Will you help me? Please?
好，再见012---Okay. Bye.
摩妮卡不去了 只剩下我跟瑞秋012---Monica's not coming. It's just gonna be me and Rachel.
等等，你这黄鼠狼 你仔细思考过了吗？012---Hold on there, camper. You sure you've thought this through?
只是去洗衣服 不太需要用到大脑吧012---It's laundry. The thinking through is pretty minimal.
只有你跟瑞秋？ 只有你们两个？012---It's just you and Rachel? Just the two of you?
这是约会 你们要去约会了012---This is a date. You're going on a date.
恩-啊012---Nuh-uh.
呀-哈012---Yeah-huh.
你觉得呢？012---What are you saying?
我该再刮一下胡子 或拿瓶酒过去吗?012---I should shave again? Pick up some wine? What?
嗯，你也许需要 再考虑一下你的脏内裤012---Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
这将是她首次目睹你的内裤 你希望是脏脏的吗？012---It's the first time she'll see your underwear. You want it to be dirty?
不希望012---No.
还有柔衣精呢？012---And the fabric softener?
好，我的柔衣精又碍到谁了？012---Okay, okay. Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?
怎样？这代表我是一个 感性、温暖的男人012---What? It says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy.
知道吗？就像一只毛绒绒的小熊012---You know, like a little fuzzy bear.
我在路上再买别的好了012---I can pick something else up on the way.
谢谢012---MONICA: Thank you.

什么？012---What?
没有洗衣粉就不能保留，好吗？012---No suds, no save, okay?
- 什么事？ - 嗨012---- What's going on? - Hi.

我知道说来有点蠢…012---RACHEL: Okay, I know this is gonna sound really stupid...
不过我觉得 如果我今天能成功…012---...but I feel that if I can do this...
如果我真的能洗我自己的衣服…012---...if I can actually do my own laundry...
这世上就没有我办不到的事了012---...there isn't anything I can't do.
我倒觉得 这句话一点也不蠢012---That does not sound stupid to me.
卡萝离开我后 我第一次自己煮东西时…012---No, it's like... The first time I had to make dinner for myself after Carol left me...

近亲乱伦012---...cocktails in Appalachia.
- 他们很亲密 - 亲密？她的舌头都跑到他耳朵里了012---- Come on, they're close. - Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

乔伊，这很病态 很恶心、很…012---Joey, this is sick. It's disgusting. It's...
这不是真的，对不对？012---...not really true, is it?
谁晓得什么才是真的？012---Who's to say what's true?

不好意思…012---Excuse me...

我整晚都在讲我的事 真的很抱歉012---I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry.

我一直坐到布鲁克林站…012---...and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn...
只为了好玩012---...just for the hell of it.
我们聊到两点 实在是完美的夜晚012---We talked till 2. It was this perfect evening.
多多少少啦012---More or less.
突然间 我们发现自己身处也门012---Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen.
抱歉，谁是我们…？012---I'm sorry, so "we" is?
就是我和瑞克012---"We" is me and Rick.
- 谁是瑞克？ - 谁是瑞克？012---- Who's Rick? - Who's Rick?
我先生012---My husband.
哦012---ALL: Ooh.
- 噢，所以你离婚了？ - 没有012---- Oh, so you're divorced? - No.
抱歉，所以你在守寡吗？ 希望如此012---I'm sorry. So you're widowed? Hopefully?
不，我还是有夫之妇012---No, I'm still married.
那你先生对于你在这里 有什么想法？012---So how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me...
还把脚滑到我的脚上面…012---...sliding your foot so far up my leg...
连口袋里有多少零钱 都数得出来012---...you can count the change in my pocket?
别担心012---Don't worry.
我想说他应该不会介意 因为他也没有太介意伊森012---I imagine he'd be okay with you because he's okay with Ethan.
伊森？谁是伊森？012---Ethan? There's an Ethan?
伊森是我的…012---Ethan is my...
男朋友012---...boyfriend.
什么？!012---ALL: What?
跟我解释一下 竟然你已经有丈夫跟男友了012---So, uh, what kind of relationship do you imagine us having...
你希望我们会有什么样的关系？012---...if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
我想主要是性关系吧012---I suppose, mainly sexual.
呵012---Huh.
很遗憾没有成功012---I'm sorry it didn't work out.
什么没有成功？ 我星期四还会再跟她见面012---What not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
你没有听到自己说的故事吗？012---Didn't you listen to the story?
太诡异了，你怎么可以 跟这样的女人交往？012---How could you get involved with a woman like this?
我一开始也很难接受 但是想想其实百益无一害012---I had trouble with it at first, but I get all the good stuff.
只要谈天说笑 还有性…012---All the fun, all the talking, all the sex...
完全不用负责任012---...and no responsibility.
这可是每个男人的梦想012---This is every guy's fantasy!
才不是，罗斯 这是你的梦想吗？012---That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
当然不是012---No, of course not.
是，没错012---Yeah. Yeah, it is.
所以你们不介意 跟有其他伴侣的女性交往？012---You'd go out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
我做不到012---I couldn't.
很好012---Good for you.
我和女性交往时 我必须知道…012---When I'm with a woman, I need to know...
我交往的人 比她还多012---...that I'm going out with more people than she is.
一夫一妻012---You know...
确实值得商榷012---...monogamy can be a tricky concept.
就人类学上的角度来说…012---I mean, anthropologically...
好吧，你们永远 都不会知道了012---Fine. Now you'll never know.
我们只是开玩笑啦 说吧012---We're kidding. Tell us.
- 我们都想知道 - 说啦012---MONICA: We wanna know. JOEY: Come on!
好吧，理查李基 有一个理论…012---All right. There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey...
塔-哒012---Ta-da!
我们以后都要用这样的方式 打招呼吗？我还挺喜欢的012---Are we greeting each other this way now? I like that.
你们看，我打扫了012---Look! I cleaned!
我擦了窗户 地板012---I did the windows. I did the floors.
我还用了吸尘器所有的接头 除了圆的那一个012---I used all the attachments on the vacuum except for that round one.
我不知道那是用来做什么的012---I don't know what it's for.
没有人知道 我们也不该问012---Nobody knows, and we're not supposed to ask.
你们觉得怎么样？012---RACHEL: What do you think?
- 很干净 - 真的，很棒012---CHANDLER: It's very clean. MONICA: Really, it looks great!
我看到你移动了绿色的垫椅012---Oh. Heh. I see you moved the green ottoman.
啊哦012---ROSS & PHOEBE: Uh-oh.
是怎么发生的？012---How did that happen?
不知道啊 我觉得放那边比较好看012---I don't know. I thought it looked better there.
而且茶几旁边 也多一个座位012---And also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
对，是蛮有趣的012---Yeah, it's interesting.
这样好了，只是好玩…012---But you know what? Just for fun...
看看放在原本的位置会如何012---...let's see what it looked like in the old spot.
只是比较一下012---Just to compare.
看一下012---Let's see. Ha!
嗯，放在这里 也很棒012---Well, it looks good there too.
先摆在这里吧012---Let's leave it there for a while.
真不敢相信你试着 搬动那个绿色的垫椅012---I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
幸好你没摊开杂志012---Thank God you didn't fan out the magazines.
不然她会把你的眼睛挖出来012---She'll scratch your eyes out.
我没有那么糟糕吧？012---You guys, I am not that bad!
你有，摩妮卡012---Yeah, you are.
还记得我跟你 住在一起过吗012---Remember, I lived with you?
你就是一副…012---You were a little, you know...
这样说超不公平的012---That is so unfair!
拜托，我们小时候 你的破娃娃是唯一不破的012---When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.
好吧，我比较有责任心 有组织性012---Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized.
但我也能很懒散012---But, hey, I can be a kook!
好吧，懒女人012---All right, you madcap gal!
想像这个情况012---Try to imagine this.
电话帐单寄来了 但是你没有立刻付费012---The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
- 为什么没有 - 因为你很懒散012---- Why not? - Because you're a kook!
所以你等到他们 再寄一张通知给你012---Instead, you wait until they send you a notice.
我做得到012---I could do that.
好 你让我去采购…012---Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping...
我买了洗衣精012---...and I buy laundry detergent.
但不是容易挤出来的那种012---But it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
怎么会有人这么做012---Why would someone do that?
有些人会这样想012---One might wonder.
有人把杯子放在茶几上 没有杯垫012---A glass is on the table. There's no coaster.
是一杯冷饮 在大热天之下012---It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.
小水珠逐渐逼近桌面…012---Beads of condensation are inching their way closer to the wood...
不要说了012---Stop it!
天哪012---Oh, my God!
是真的，我是什么样的人？012---It's true. Who am I?
摩妮卡，你是妈012---Monica, you're Mom.
我的天啊012---JOEY: Uh-huh? Oh, my God!
好的012---Okay.
好，我会去的012---Okay, I'll be there.

好吗？他开始冲澡…012---All right? He goes into the shower, and then...
我就演他的屁股012---...I'm his butt.

你们别这样012---Come on, you guys.
这是部艾尔·帕西诺主演 大制作的电影012---This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!
不，真的太棒了012---Oh, no, it's terrific.
你努力了这么多年…012---After all your years of struggling...
终于有机会 “挤”进娱乐圈了012---...you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
好吧，你们尽量开玩笑 我才不在乎012---Okay, fine. Make jokes, I don't care.
这是我的一大突破012---This is a big break for me!
你说得没错012---You're right. It is.
那你要请我们去看 屁股首映会吗？012---So are you gonna invite us all to the big opening?

我的眼睛啊…！012---My eyes! My eyes!
我警告过你了012---MONICA: I warned you.
是谁这么吵？012---Who is being loud?
噢，是摩妮卡012---Oh, that would be Monica.
嘿，我可以借点东西吗？ 我想煮早餐给欧若拉吃012---Can I borrow some things? I wanna make Aurora breakfast.
噢，你有整夜的时间能陪她？012---You got the whole night, huh?
对，我只有二十分钟 直到伊森…012---Well, I only have 20 minutes until Ethan, so...
有人有点哀怨喔？012---Do I sense a bit of resentment?
不…没有哀怨 相信我…012---No, no, no. No resentment. Believe me...
真的很值得012---...it's worth it, okay?
在感情关系中 总是有些特别难忘的时刻012---In a relationship, you have these key moments...
让你一辈子都会记得012---...you'll remember for the rest of your life.
跟欧若拉在一起的 每分每秒都像那样012---Well, every single second is like that with Aurora.
而我刚刚浪费了三十五秒的时间 跟你们说话012---And I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you.
摩妮卡，你可以 帮我开门吗？012---So, uh, Monica, can you help me with the door?
钱德，以前的摩妮卡 会提醒你…012---Um, Chandler, you know, the old Monica would remind you...
用塑胶刷 刷洗锅子012---...to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush.
但是我不会那么做012---But I'm not gonna do that.
该死，就聘请她012---DIRECTOR: Damn it! Hire the girl.

屁股男，你在干什么？012---Butt guy, what are you doing?
我在冲澡012---I'm showering.
不，你在挤屁股012---No, that was clenching.
我的想法是 这个家伙很难过012---Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know?
他老婆死了 哥哥又失踪012---His wife's dead, his brother's missing.
他的屁股这时候 应该会很生气012---I think his butt would be angry here.
我认为他的屁股 会想在午餐前拍好012---I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch.
再来一次 开水012---Once again, rolling. Water working.
开拍012---And action!

我想表现出沉静的绝望012---I was going for quiet desperation.
但如果你想问…012---But if you have to ask...
天啊，我好爱这些手指012---God, I love these fingers.
谢谢012---Thank you.
我其实是指我的手指012---No, actually, I meant my fingers.
看看它们有多开心012---Look at them. Look at how happy they are.
- 天啊，我迟到了 - 不要012---- Oh, my God, I'm late! - Oh, no, no, no.
- 不要走 - 好012---- Don't go, don't go. - Okay, okay.
- 我真的得走 - 她要走了012---- I have to. - Look, she's leaving.
对不起，他会等我012---I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
我以为你跟瑞克谈过了012---I thought you talked to Rick.
不是瑞克012---It's not Rick.
伊森？他可以陪你 - 整天的时问！012---Ethan? He gets the whole day with you!
不，是安德鲁012---No, it's Andrew.
我知道会有好几年的时间…012---I know there'll be many moments...
我将后悔问你以下的问题 但是…012---...when I'll regret asking the following question, but...
安德鲁是谁？012---And Andrew is?
他是…新欢012---He's... new.
你是说瑞克、伊森和我 无法满足你？012---So you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
我并不是…012---No, that's not exactly what I was...
不知道有多少女人…012---Most women would kill...
会被我们三个人迷倒012---...for three guys like us.
那你想要什么？012---So, what do you want?
你012---You.
- 你已经有我了 - 不，只是你012---- You have me. - No, no. Just you.
什么意思？012---What do you mean?
甩掉其他人012---Lose the other guys.
他们所有人吗？012---Like, all of them?
别这样，我们在一起很开心 为什么不行？012---Come on, we're great together. Why not?
我们为什么不能 保持这样就好？012---Why can't we just have what we have now?
只要谈天说笑跟性…012---Why can't we just talk, laugh and make love...
彼此没有任何负担？012---...without feeling obligated to one another?
今晚之前，我以为 这也是你想要的012---Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.
部分的我想要…012---Well, part of me wants that...
但我就像个双面人012---...but it's like I'm two guys.
其中一个说 〝闭嘴，这样很棒〞012---I mean, one guy's saying, "Shut up! This is great!"
但还有另一个人012---But there's this other guy.
他每次都会挺身而出…012---It's the guy who wells up every time the Grinch's heart...
仗义直言012---...grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device.
他会说〝这太难了 快点脱身〞012---He's saying, you know, "This is too hard. Get out, get out!"
那你会听哪个人的话？012---So which one of the two guys will you listen to?
两个人的话我都听 他们一直插嘴012---I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish.
哪个人？012---Which one?
第二个012---The second guy.
我懂了012---I see.
如果改变心意 就打给我012---Call me if you change your mind.
抱歉，第一个人主管嘴唇012---Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
这样想吧，是你甩了她012---Look at it this way. You dumped her!
对吧 这个女生…012---Right? I mean, this woman was...
超级性感…012---...unbelievably sexy...
又美丽 聪明 超难追…012---...and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable...
再说一次你为什么这么做012---Tell me why you did this again?
嘿！嘿！012---ROSS: Hey!  MONICA: Hey!
电影明星来了012---RACHEL: Movie star!

我被炒鱿鱼了012---I got fired!
他们说我太投入了012---They said I acted too much with it.

六年来，我一直在演烂戏…012---I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years...
终于有机会了 却被我搞砸012---...and I finally get my shot, and I blow it!

我觉得当机会真的来临 你就会知道012---I think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot.
感觉像是你的机会吗012---Did it feel like your shot?
很难说，我当时光着身体012---Hard to tell. I was naked.
我不认为这是你的机会012---I don't think this was your shot.
我甚至不认为 你只会有一个机会012---I don't even think you just get one shot.
我真的相信 你会有一番作为012---I really believe big things are gonna happen for you. I do.

完全都不整齐012---...in that reckless, haphazard manner?
无所谓，我明天再收 或者是改天012---It doesn't matter. I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!
随便啦012---Whenever.
她真的很懒012---She is a kook.
如果你这么心烦 就去把鞋子收好012---If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.
不，不要去012---No, don't do this!
太蠢了012---This is stupid!
我不需要证明任何事 我要去收012---I don't have to prove anything. I'm gonna go get them.
但是这样 大家都会知道012---But then everyone will know.

但我得告诉你一件事 大家都太高估激情了012---I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
- 对 - 没错012---- Yeah, right. - It is.
最后激情会褪去012---Eventually, it kind of burns out.

- 嘘  - 嘘012---- Shh! - Shh!
- 什么  - 我们会嘘个不停012---- What are we shushing? - We're shushing...
是因为我们想听见声音012---...because we're trying to hear something.

- 抱歉，不是 - 不用了，谢谢012---- Uh, sorry, it's not. - Then, no, thanks.
那是怎么一回事？012---CHANDLER [THINKING]: What the hell was that?
别忘了，吉儿古德克请你吃口香糖 一定要接受012---Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it.

什么原因012---And that would be?
我不能告诉你012---I, uh... I can't tell you.
乔伊，发生了什么事012---What's going on?
听着，你得发誓 你不会告诉罗斯是我说的012---Okay, listen. You gotta promise you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

别看我，那是罗斯的事012---Don't look at me. This is Ross' thing.
这太老套了 每次我都是最后知道的人012---This is so typical. I'm always the last to know everything.
才怪，我们告诉你很多事012---- You are not. We tell you stuff. - Uh-huh.
钱德被孔雀咬伤 我是最后一个知道的人012---I was the last one to know when Chandler got bit by the peacock at the zoo.
我是最后一个知道 你当初暗恋乔伊的人012---I was the last to know you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
什么？012---What?

真的好漂亮012---It's so nice.
我有个问题012---Hey, I have a question.
事实上它不是个问题012---Uh, actually, it's not so much a question...

对我来说口香糖很完美012---For me, gum is perfection.

那只猫是巴洛的猫 真的很有趣吧？012---The cat turned out to be Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?
那真的很有趣，瑞秋一直摸他012---That is funny. And Rachel keeps touching him.
我到处找过了 但就是找不到那只猫012---I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
我找到它了，它是巴洛的猫012---Oh, I found him. It was Paolo's cat.

我知道，我好想咬住他的下唇012---I know. I just wanna bite his bottom lip.
但我不会那么做012---But I won't.
天啊，他第一次对着我笑012---God. The first time he smiled at me...
那三秒钟比我跟巴瑞 在百慕达度过的三星期刺激012---...those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
你们有租摩托车吗？012---Did you rent mopeds?
因为我听说…012---Because I've heard...
那不是现在的重点012---Oh, it's not about that right now. Okay.
我知道这超肤浅的 而且我们没有共通点012---I know it's totally superficial, and we have nothing in common...
连说的语言都不一样012---...and we don't even speak the same language...
但是天啊012---...but, God.
巴洛，嗨012---Paolo, hi.

不，技术上来说我们没有性关系 但那…012---No, no. Um, technically, the sex is not being had. But that's, uh...
那不是重点012---That's not the point.
重点是瑞秋跟我应该…012---The point is that, uh, Rachel and I should be, uh...
瑞秋跟我应该在一起012---Well, Rachel and I should be together.
如果你…012---And if you get in the, uh...
- 上床… - 不012---- In bed? - No.
不，我不是那个意思012---Ha. No, not where I was going.
如果你介入我们之间的感觉012---If you get in the way of us becoming a thing...
那么我会非常难过012---...then, uh, I would be, well, very sad.
哦012---Oh.
所以你…012---So do you, um?
- 你会的英文不多？ - 我只懂一些012---- You do know a little English? - Little.
你知道什么是〝讨厌鬼〞吗？012---Do you know the word crap-weasel?
不，那真的很有趣 你是讨厌鬼012---No? That's funny, you are a huge crap-weasel.
钱德，我们已经玩了一小时 看好了，真的很简单012---Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this. Watch, it's easy.
- 好 - 准备好了吗？012---- Ready? - Mm-hm.
好吗？试试看012---Okay? Now try it.
不，你得把它甩出去012---You gotta whip it.
快看，最后一根蜡烛要熄了012---Look, look. The last candle's about to burn out.
十 , 九 , 八 , 七…012---Ten, nine, eight, seven...
负46，负47，负48012---...minus 46, minus 47, minus 48...
- 谢谢 - 谢谢012---ROSS: Thank you. MONICA: Thanks.
没有灯光感觉好恐怖012---ROSS: Kind of spooky without any lights.
大伙们，我有个好点子012---ROSS: Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.
罗斯012---Uh, Ross...
或许我不该在这个时候说012---This probably isn't the best time to bring it up...
但你得帮摩妮卡办个派对012---...but you have to throw a party for Monica.
- 这真的太好玩了 - 对012---- This has been fun. - Yes.
谢谢你借我电话012---Yes. Thanks for, uh, letting me use your phone...
还救了我一命012---...and for saving my life.
再见，钱德012---Well, goodbye, Chandler.
停电时我玩得很开心012---I had a great blackout.
再见012---See you.
我的帐号是7143457 我不知道你们有没有拍到012---Hi. Um, I'm account number 7143457. And I don't know if you got any of that...
但我真的很想要拷贝一卷录影带012---...but I would really like a copy of the tape.
帅哥，你好吗012---Hey, gorgeous. How's it going?
在日光灯底下吃着日本泡面012---Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights.
还能更好吗012---Does it get better than this?
有个问题 你没有跟任何人交往吧012---Question: You're not dating, are you?
因为我遇见一个 超适合你的完美对象012---I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
完美可能会是个问题012---You see, perfect might be a problem.
如果你说的是互相依赖 或自我毁灭…012---Had you said co-dependent or self-destructive...
- 你星期六想去约会吗  - 是的，很想012---- You want a date Saturday? - Yes, please.
好012---okay

我只是…012---Oh, God. I just...
你很棒… 天啊012---You're nice... Oh, God.
很好，雪莉 我实在是没脸见人012---Good, Shelly. Okay. I'm gonna go flush myself down the toilet now.
好，再见012---Okay. Bye-bye.
《老友记》 第一季 第8集：奶奶死了两次012---Friends S01E08: The One Where Nana Dies Twice
经过那件事之后 真的很难继续享受拉面 很夸张对吧012---CHANDLER: It's hard to enjoy noodles after that. Is that ridiculous?
你们能相信 她真的这样认为吗012---Can you believe she actually thought that?
可以012---Yeah.
我刚认识你的时候  我想说或许…012---Well, when I first met you, I thought maybe...
有可能…012---...possibly...
你可能是012---...you might be.
真的012---You did?
然后你在菲比的生日派对上 一直对我的胸部说话…012---Then you spent Phoebe's birthday party talking to my breasts...
所以我想说应该不是012---...so then I figured maybe not.
你们其他人刚认识我的时候 有那么想吗012---Huh. Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
- 我有 - 我想有012---- I did. - I think so.
- 我没有 - 不…我也没有012---- Not me. - No, no, me neither.
不过大学时期的苏珊有012---Although, uh, back in college, Susan Saladore did.
你在开玩笑012---You're kidding.
- 你有跟她说我不是吗  - 没有012---- Did you tell her I wasn't? - No.
因为我想跟她交往012---It's because I wanted to go out with her too.
所以我跟她说 你和伯尼交往…012---So I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman...
伯尼也喜欢她012---...who also liked her.
太有趣了012---Well, this is fascinating.
那是什么原因012---So, uh, what is it about me?
我不知道，因为你很聪明、好笑…012---I don't know. Because you're smart, you're funny...
罗斯也是啊 你们有想过他是吗012---Ross is smart and funny. You ever think that about him?
- 是啊 - 那到底是什么原因012---- Ha, ha. Yeah, right. - What is it?
我不知道，你就是… 你有种特质012---Okay, I don't know. You just... You have a quality.
- 没错 - 对，某种特质012---- Yes, exactly. - Right?
有种特质012---Yeah, a quality.
〝特质〞，很好 因为我很担心你们会说得很模糊012---"A quality." Good. I was worried you were gonna be vague about this.
喂012---Hello?
喂012---Hello?
瑞秋，是罗马的巴洛012---Oh. Rachel. It's Paolo calling from Rome.
天啊 他从罗马打来012---Oh, my God. Calling from Rome.
他从罗马打来 我也做得到啊012---So he's calling from Rome. I could do that.
只要去罗马就行了012---Just gotta go to Rome.
摩妮卡 你爸打进来 你可以讲快一点吗012---Monica, your dad just beeped in. Can you make it quick?
我在跟罗马通话012---I'm talking to Rome.
跟我通话的人在罗马012---talking to Rome...
爸，什么事012---Hey, Dad. What's up?
天哪012---Oh, God.
罗斯，是奶奶012---Ross, it's Nana.
嘿012---Hey.
- 你们好吗  - 嘿，爸012---MONICA: How you doing? ROSS: Hey, Dad.
她还好吗？012---So, uh, how's she doing?
医生说只剩几小时了012---The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
- 你还好吗，妈 - 我 我很好012---- How are you, Mom? - Me? I'm fine, fine.
我很高兴你来了012---I'm glad you're here.
你的头发怎么了012---What's with your hair?
怎么了012---What?
有什么不同012---What's different?
没有啊012---Nothing.
噢，大概就是这样吧012---Oh, maybe that's it.
她实在是令人难以置信 她母亲…012---She's unbelievable. Her mother's...
好，放轻松点012---Okay, relax, relax.
看来我们还要在这里 待一段时问012---We are gonna be here a while, it looks like.
免不了还要谈你男友 和工作的事012---We still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
天啊012---Oh, God.
她皮包里有发霉的薄荷糖012---The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
对，超恶心的012---Yeah, they were gross.
你们知道我最爱什么吗012---Oh, you know what I love?
她的代糖012---Her Sweet 'N Lows.
她老是从餐厅偷代糖012---How she was always stealing them from restaurants.
不只是餐厅 还有我们家012---Not just restaurants, from our house.
盖勒太太012---Mrs. Geller?
她看起来好小一只012---ROSS: She looks so small.
我知道012---I know.
至少她现在有阿公 和菲利斯婶婶陪伴012---Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
再见了，奶奶012---Goodbye, Nana.
别了，奶奶012---Bye, Nana.
罗斯！012---Ross!
护士012---Nurse.
怎么了012---What is going on?
护士不是说奶奶走了吗012---You know, uh, how the nurse said Nana had passed?
但并不是012---Well, she's not quite.
- 什么  - 她没走012---- What? - She's not passed.
她还在，她回来了012---She's present. She's back.
怎么了012---What's going on?
她可能死了012---She may have died.
〝她可能死了〞012---"She may have died"?
我们还在观察012---We're looking into it.
我进去看看012---Uh, I'll go see.
这种事几乎不可能发生012---This almost never happens.
现在她走了012---Now she's passed.
我一定得知道012---I just have to know, okay?
是我的头发吗012---Is it my hair?
没错，钱德，就是这样 你的头发012---Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
对，你有同志头发012---Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
- 嘿 - 嗨012---RACHEL: Hey. MONICA: Hi.
那她…012---RACHEL: So did she?
两次012---Twice.
真是糟透了012---Oh, that sucks.
你们还好吗012---You guys okay?
我不知道，感觉好怪012---I don't know. It's weird.
我知道她走了 但我就是不觉得…012---I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
或许是因为 她没有真的走了012---Maybe that's because she's not really gone.
不，她走了012---No, no, she's gone.
我们有检查012---We checked.
很多次012---A lot.
我是说，或许人不会真的走012---No, I mean, maybe no one ever really goes.
自从我妈死掉后 我偶尔…012---Ever since my mom died, every now and then...
会感觉到她就在这里012---...I get this feeling that she's, like, right here, you know?
还有我国中最好的朋友，黛比…012---Oh. And Debbie, my best friend from junior high...
她去打迷你高尔夫时 被问电击中012---...got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course.
用黄色的铅笔时012---I always get this strong Debbie vibe...
我总是能感应到黛比012---...whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils.
我好想她012---I miss her.
菲比，你想要这个吗012---Want this?
- 噢，谢了 - 不客气012---- Oh, thanks. - Sure.
我今早才把它削尖的012---I just sharpened her this morning.
我完全不相信那一套 你死掉后…012---See, I don't believe any of that. I think when you're dead...
就是死了，消失了 成了虫的食物012---...you're dead. You're gone. You're worm food.
钱德看起来很像同志对吧012---So Chandler looks gay, huh?
我不知道这是谁 但绝不是黛比012---I don't know who this is, but it's not Debbie.
我以为要用密封的棺木012---I thought it'd be a closed casket.
这不代表她不能 看起来体面一点012---Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice.
孩子，你想你进得去吗012---Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
当然可以012---I don't see why not.
我的牙齿矫正器在这里012---ROSS: Here's my retainer.
我一直在想…012---I was just thinking...
- 轮到我的时候… - 爸012---...when my time comes... - Dad.
听我说012---Listen to me.
轮到我的时候 我想海葬012---When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
什么012---You what?
我想葬在海里 看起来很好玩012---I wanna be buried at sea. It looks like fun.
解释一下〝好玩〞的意思012---Define "fun."
别这样，那一天你们会很开心的 租艘船，带些午餐…012---Come on. You'll make a day of it. You'll get a boat, pack a lunch...
然后把你的尸体丢到海里 听起来真好玩012---And then we throw your body in the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
大家都以为很了解我012---Everyone thinks they know me.
大家都说杰克盖勒 太好猜了012---Everyone says, "Jack Geller, so predictable."
或许我走后，他们会说 〝海葬？〞012---Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, "Buried at sea? Huh."
他们大概就会这样说012---That's probably what they'll say.
我喜欢这样012---I'd like that.
- 嘿，美女 - 嘿012---- Hey, gorgeous. - Hey.
听着，昨天的事 我很抱歉012---Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
别担心，显然其他人 也会犯相同的错误012---Don't worry about it. Apparently, other people have made the same mistake.
那好012---Oh. Okay. Phew.
那你觉得我是哪里像012---So, uh, what do you think it is about me?
我不知道012---I don't know what.
你就是有种…012---You just have...
- 特质 - 特质，对，太好了012---...a quality. - A quality. Right. Great.
太可惜，因为你和罗威尔 会是很棒的一对012---It's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
罗威尔 金融服务部的罗威尔  你认为我适合跟他在一起012---Lowell? Financial Services Lowell? That's who you saw me with?
干嘛 他很可爱啊012---What? He's cute.
是啊012---Well, yeah.
他比出纳处的布莱恩好多了012---He's no Brian in Payroll.
布莱恩是…012---Is Brian?
不，我不知道 重点是，如果你要撮合我跟某人…012---No. I don't know. The point is, if you were gonna set me up...
我会希望是像他那样的人012---...I'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him.
我认为你配不上布莱恩012---Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
不好意思 你认为 我追不到布莱恩012---Excuse me. You don't think I could get a Brian?
因为我绝对可以追到布莱恩 相信我012---Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me.
我真的不是012---I'm really not.
这一件012---ROSS: This one?
不好012---No.
我已经给你们看过 所有洋装了012---I've shown you every dress we have.
除非你们想让她穿着 柠檬黄色套装入土…012---Unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...
不然就选酒红色012---...go with the burgundy.
不管我们选什么 她都不会满意012---Whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
没错，就选酒红色012---You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
很棒的选择，我要出来了012---A fine choice. I'm coming out.
等等，我们还需要鞋子012---Wait. We need shoes.
好012---Okay. Uh...
这些如何012---How about these?
那些是日鞋012---That's really a day shoe.
她去的地方 别人的打扮会更隆重吗012---And where she's going, everyone else will be dressier?
能找鞋跟细一点的鞋吗012---Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
好，我找不到酒红色的晚鞋012---Okay. I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
不过有双银色的鞋或许适合012---I can show you something in a silver that may work.
不行，一定要酒红色012---No, it really should be burgundy.
- 除非我们挑另一件洋装 - 对012---- Unless we go with a different dress. - Yes.
不、不、不，我看看012---No, no, no. Watch this.
等等，后面或许有适合的012---Wait, I may have something in the back.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
- 没事吧  - 没事012---Is everything all right, dear?
只是奶奶的东西012---Just Nana's stuff.
大家怎么样  都好了吗012---How we doing? You guys ready?
妈打电话给我 提醒我不要把头发绑起来012---Mom called to remind me not to wear my hair up.
知道我的耳朵 不是我最漂亮的部位吗012---Did you know my ears were not my best feature?
有时候我会一直耿耿于怀012---Some days it's all I can think about.
抱歉我迟到了 我找不到我的耳圈012---Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't find my bearings.
你是说耳环吗012---Heh. You mean your earrings?
我说了什么？012---What did I say?
- 就是这双鞋子吗 - 对，巴洛从意大利寄过来的012---- Are these the shoes? - Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
干嘛 我们这里 没有鞋子吗012---What? We, uh, don't have shoes here?
早安  准备好出发了吗012---Morning. We ready to go?
打扮后，我们看起来都很棒吧012---Don't we look nice all dressed up?
就是这类的评论吧012---It's stuff like that, isn't it?
- 真的是很棒的仪式 - 的确012---- It was a beautiful service. - It really was.
过来，亲爱的012---Come here, sweetheart.
你知道…012---You know...
我认为该是你 开始使用晚霜的时候了012---...I think it's time for you to start using night cream.
干嘛012---What?
没什么，只是你的大衣很吵012---Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Musburger.
你看看，《巨人队》对《牛仔队》012---Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
你在葬礼时看美式足球赛？012---You're watching football at a funeral?
不，这只是赛前分析 待会在宴会上才要看012---No, it's the pregame. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
你这个人真是充满惊奇012---You're a frightening, frightening man.
噢，不会吧，我的巴洛鞋012---RACHEL: Oh, no. My new Paolo shoes.
希望鞋没坏012---Oh. I hope they're not ruined.
天啊，真是美好的一天012---PHOEBE: God, what a great day.
干嘛？我是说天气012---What? Weatherwise.
我知道012---I know.
空气和树木012---The air, the trees.
虽然奶奶走了 但是…012---Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost, uh, life...
- 罗斯，你没事吧 - 罗斯！012---- Ross, are you okay? - Ross!
我没事012---I'm fine. No, I'm fine.
只是…012---Just...

不用担心，我只是看看 你是否肌肉痉挛012---PHOEBE: I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm.
- 呵  - 怎么了？012---- Huh. - What? What is it?
- 你少穿了一个皮带孔  - 噢012---- You missed a belt loop. - Ugh.

你奶奶一定不会喜欢的012---Your grandmother would've hated this.
当然，这是她的葬礼012---Well, sure. What with it being her funeral and all.
不，我会一直听到她说…012---No, I'd be hearing about...
为什么没有蜜糖火腿012---...why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?
或是我买的花不够 又或者是…012---Or I didn't spend enough on flowers. If I spent more, she'd say:
何必浪费那么多钱  我都死了012---"Why waste your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead."

在一起生活是什么滋味吗？012---...with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?

你只会很开心 你没有腮了012---You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
你不用一直对他说话 你可以用唱的…012---Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it.
拜托，我才不要对着你的肚子唱歌 可以吗？012---Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, okay?
还顺利吗？012---- How's it going? ROSS: Shh, shh, shh.

走在大街上012---Walkin' down the street
每个人看起来很有趣012---Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet
嘿，嘿…012---Hey, hey...
- 嘿，你有感觉到吗？ - 有012---- Hey, uh, did you just feel that? - I did.
- 一直都有…？ - 不，这是第一次012---- Well, does it always, uh...? - No, no, that was the first.
继续唱，继续唱012---- Keep singing. Keep singing. ROSS: Oh.
嘿，嘿，你是我的宝宝012---Hey, hey, you're my baby

等你出来了，我要给你买个贝果 然后再一起去动物园012---When you come out I'll buy you a bagel And then we'll go to the zoo
这次我有感觉到012---I felt it that time.

只有一个钥匙洞 却有一大堆钥匙012---Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys.
你自己想想012---You do the math.
你们干嘛保存一大堆钥匙？012---Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
就是为了应付这类紧急状况012---For an emergency just like this.
听着，你这嘻皮笑脸的012---All right, listen, smirky.
要不是因为你的笨气球012---If it wasn't for your stupid balloon...
我早就上飞机 看着一个女人这样比了012---...I would be on a plane, watching a woman do this right now.
可是我没有012---But I'm not.
你说你有钥匙的012---I swear you said you had the keys.
不，我没有 我没钥匙就不会说我有012---No. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys.
我显然的没有钥匙012---And I obviously did not have the keys.
够了，不要再说钥匙了 统统不准说钥匙012---Okay, all right, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say "keys."
我怎么可能会有钥匙？012---Why would I have the keys?
因为你说你有012---Aside from the fact that you said you did?
- 我没说 - 你应该有012---- But I didn't. - Well, you should have.
- 为什么？为什么？ - 因为…012---MONICA: Why? RACHEL: Because.
为什么？ 因为一切都是我的责任吗？012---Why? Because everything is my responsibility?
我都负责煮晚饭了还不够？012---Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?
大家都要不一样的马铃薯 所以我就全做了012---Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.
可是有谁在乎我要哪种．马铃薯？012---You know, does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
没有，没有，没有012---No, no, no!
只要菲比有她的豆子跟洋葱012---You know, just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions...
马利欧先生有薯球…012---...and Mario gets his Tots.
这是我的第一个感恩节晚餐，我…012---It's my first Thanksgiving, and I...

我来喽012---Here we come
走在…012---Walkin' down the...
这味道不像妈的厨房012---This doesn't smell like Mom's.
是不像，对吧？你要有颗粒的？012---No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?
给你，兄弟，这就是你的颗粒012---Well, here you go, buddy. You got one.
天，这下可好012---Oh, God, this is great.
飞机跑了 我想我只好跟你们卡在这里了012---The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
嘿，我们都有较好的计划 这又不是大家的首选012---Hey, we all had better plans, okay? This was nobody's first choice.
哦，真的吗？012---Oh, really?
那我干嘛忙得要死012---So why was I busting my ass...
想弄出一顿美味的大餐？012---...to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?!
- 这叫美味吗？ - 给我闭嘴！012---- You call that delicious? - You be quiet!
别吵了，别吵了，别吵了！012---All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!
这样子感觉才像感恩节012---Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
干嘛？012---PHOEBE: Ew. - What?
丑陋的裸男 从烤箱里把他的火鸡拿出来了012---PHOEBE: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
哟012---JOEY, ROSS & MONICA: Eh.
哦，我的天，他有人陪012---PHOEBE: Oh, my God. He's not alone.
丑陋的裸男…012---Ugly Naked Guy...
跟丑陋的裸女 共享感恩大餐012---...is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
这我得瞧瞧012---JOEY: I gotta see this.
喔012---ALL: Aw.
丑陋的裸男，好家伙012---All right, Ugly Naked Guy.
丑陋的裸舞012---Ooh, ugly naked dancing.
他有伴真的很好012---It's nice that he has someone.
我可以开始切了吗？012---Shall I carve?
请便012---By all means.
好012---CHANDLER: All right.
谁要白起司 谁要黑起司的？012---Okay, who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?
我根本不想问什么叫黑起司012---I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
- 有人要分吃这块吗？ - 我要012---- Does anybody wanna split this with me? - Ooh, I will.
你们得许愿才行012---Mm. You guys have to make a wish.
- 许愿？ - 得了，你们是知道的，就感恩节啊012---- Make a wish? - Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
你抢到比较大块的 你刚才许什么愿？012---Ooh. You got the bigger half. What did you wish for?
就…要比较大块的012---The bigger half.
好，我想举杯庆祝012---All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
举杯了012---- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding. ALL: Mm.
我知道这也许不是 你们大家想要的感恩节012---This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...
可是对我来说 今天的感恩节真的很棒012---...but for me this has been really great, you know?
我想这是因为今天没有人离婚012---I think because it didn't involve divorce...
也没有人大吐特吐012---...or projectile vomiting.
如果你去维尔滑雪012---I was just thinking, if you'd gone to Vail...
或你们去跟家人相聚 或者要不是你得到…012---...or if you guys had been with your family, or if you didn't have...
梅毒或什么的012---...syphilis and stuff...
我们就不可能在此相聚012---...we wouldn't be all together, you know?
我想我真正想说的是…012---So I guess what I'm trying to say...
我很感恩 你们大家的感恩节全毁了012---...is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
太感人了012---RACHEL & JOEY: That's so sweet.
谢谢012---RACHEL: Thank you.
唔012---ROSS: Mm.
也预祝圣诞节很糟012---And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

他好珍贵喔 你从哪里找到他的012---Oh, he is precious. Where did you get him?
我朋友贝瑟 把他从实验室救出来的012---My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
好残忍喔012---That is so cruel.
为什么会有父母亲 把孩子命名为贝瑟012---Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
那猴子的屁股上 长了个罗斯012---Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on his ass.
罗斯，他要跟你住在你的公寓吗012---Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
对，卡萝离开后 家里冷冷清清的012---Yeah. I mean, it's been kind of quiet since Carol left, so...
为什么不找个室友就好了012---Why don't you just get a roommate?
我不知道，我觉得到了某种年纪…012---Ah, I don't know. You reach a certain age...
跟室友住有点可悲012---...having a roommate is just kind of pathe...
抱歉，我的意思是说 是很酷的生活方式012---Uh, sorry, that's "pathet," which is Sanskrit for "really cool way to live."

我不知道，某个胖子 跟店经理上床012---I don't know. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.
他根本无法逗人开心 这就是政治012---He's not even jolly. It's all political.
那你要当什么012---So, what are you gonna be?
我会当他的助手之一012---I'm gonna be one of his helpers.
这真是个耻辱012---It's just such a slap in the face, you know?
你们都知道新年 要做什么了吗012---Do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?
干嘛 新年有什么问题吗012---Gee, what? What is wrong with New Year's?
你是没有，你有巴洛012---Nothing for you. You have Paolo.
你不用面对那可怕的节庆压力…012---You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday...
急须着寻找有嘴唇的生物…012---...desperate scramble to find anything with lips...
在球落下的那一刻 有个可以亲嘴的对象，我真大声012---...just so can have somebody to kiss when the ball drops. Man, I'm talking loud.
告诉你，巴洛新年时 人会在罗马012---Well, for your information, Paolo's gonna be in Rome this New Year's.
我会跟你们一样可悲012---So I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
你想得美012---Yeah, you wish.
我受够了这个节日的疲劳轰炸012---It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
我提议今年 不要找伴，大家作个约定012---I say this year, no dates, we make a pact.

现在我… 不好意思…012---And now I... Excuse me? Excuse me?
吵闹的男士012---Yeah, noisy boys.
你们有事情想跟大家分享吗012---Is it something that you'd like to share with the group?
没有，没事012---No. No, that's okay.
你们有事情如此重要 非得在我弹奏时讨论…012---Come on, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing...
那就应该是重要到 值得与大家分享012---...then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear.
那家伙回家后一定会记得这教训012---That guy's going home with a note.
- 没事 我只是说… - 可以请你大声点吗012---- Nothing. I was just saying... - Could you speak up?
抱歉012---Sorry.
我只是在跟我朋友说 你是我见过最美丽的女人012---I was just saying to my friend, you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
- 你说黛瑞·汉娜… - 黛瑞·汉娜012---- And you said Daryl Hannah... - Darryl Hannah.
是他看过最美丽的女性012---...was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life.
我说我喜欢她在《美人鱼》的演出 《华尔街》就还好012---And I said, yeah, I liked her in Splash, but not so much in Wall Street.
- 她有种强硬气质 - 强硬特质012---- I thought she had a hard quality. - A hard quality.
黛瑞·汉娜是传统的美…012---And, uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way...
你则是散发出高雅的气质012---...you are, uh, luminous with a kind of delicate grace.
然后你就开始大吼了012---Then that's when you started yelling.
好，我们休息片刻012---Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
那家伙带回家的 应该不只是教训而已012---I think that guy's going home with more than a note.
过来，．马塞尔，坐着012---ROSS: Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
菲比，我不敢相信 他还没亲你012---Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.
我跟巴洛约会六次后…012---I mean, God, by my sixth date with Paolo...
他已经替我的胸部取小名了012---...I mean, he had already named both my breasts.
我是不是说太多了012---Ooh, did I just share too much?
一点点啦012---Just a smidge.
大卫是个科学家 做事一丝不苟012---David's, like, you know, a scientist guy. He's very methodical.

有012---MONICA: Yeah.
他就像陪我去看那部电影的男生012---Well, he's kind of like the guy I went to see that with.
除了…012---Except...
他更聪明、温柔而且贴心012---Except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter.
我只想一直和他在一起012---I just... I just want to be with him all the time.
日以继夜 夜以继日012---You know, day and night. And night and day.
特殊节日也是012---And special occasions.
等等，我懂了 你要邀他共度新年012---Wait a minute. I see where this is going. You're gonna ask him to New Year's.
你要毁约 抛弃我们012---You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
没有…012---No, no, no.
有啦，我可以吗…？012---Yeah, could I just?
- 可以，因为我已经邀了珍妮丝 - 什么012---- Yeah, because I already asked Janice. RACHEL: You what?
别这样，这是你订的约定耶012---Come on, this was a pact. This was your pact.
我耐不住，我毁约了012---I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
可是珍妮丝？ 你们的分手糟透了012---Yeah, but Janice? That was, like, the worst breakup in history.
我不是说这是好主意 我只是毁约了012---I'm not saying it was a good idea. I'm saying I snapped.
不好意思我迟到了012---Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
太多笑话了012---Too many jokes.
一定要取笑乔伊012---Must mock Joey.
很棒的鞋子吧012---Nice shoes, huh?
我快笑死了012---Aah, you're killing me.
罗斯，他又在玩我的锅铲了012---Ross. He's playing with my spatulas again.
他不会伤害它们 不是吗012---Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
你一定要把他 带来这里吗012---Do you always have to bring him here?
我不想把他单独留在家012---Look, I didn't want to leave him alone, all right?
我们今早吵了第一次架012---We had our first fight this morning.
我觉得是因为我加班的关系 我说了不该说的话012---I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.
他就朝我扔一坨屎012---He threw some feces.
如果你加班 我可以替你照顾他012---You know, if you're gonna work late, I can look in on him for you.
太好了，好…012---Oh, that would be great. Okay.
如果你去，一定要假装 你是去找他012---But if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay?
而不是帮我忙012---And you're not, like, doing it as a favor to me.
好，但是他如果问 我就要直话直说了012---Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
但我们仍无法测试这个理论012---But you can't actually test this theory.
因为现今粒子加速器的速度…012---Because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough...
仍无法模拟出这样的情况012---...to simulate these conditions.
- 好，那我有个问题 - 请说012---- Okay. All right. I have a question then. - Yeah.
你有打算要亲我吗012---Were you planning on kissing me ever?
非常合理的问题…012---Uh, that's definitely a valid question...
答案是…012---...and, uh, the answer...
有012---...would be yes.
我有这个打算012---Yes, I was.
但我要这非凡的吻…012---But see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss...
发生在非凡的时刻 因为是要亲你012---...that happened at this phenomenal moment because, well, it's you.
当然  耶012---Sure. Yeah.
对，但是我等得愈久 这个亲吻得更加非凡012---Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.
现在，已经变成…012---And now, we've reached a place...
我得…012---...where it's just got to be one of those things where I...
把桌子的东西都扫光 把你丢上去012---...sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it.
而我并不是那样的人012---And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.
大卫，我认为你正是那样的人012---Oh, David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.
只是你困在物理学家的体内罢了012---I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.
- 是吗 - 没错 我很肯定012---- Really. - Oh, yeah. I'm sure of it.
就来吧，扫掉一切 把我丢上去012---You should just do it. Just sweep and throw me. Heh.
- 现在做吗  - 就是现在…012---- Now? Now? - Right now. Just...
好…012---Okay. Okay, okay.
嗯，这个很贵012---You know what? This is just really expensive.
好，这个是礼物012---Okay. And I'll tell you, this was a gift.
- 你现在比较像在打扫 - 好吧，管他的012---- So now you're just kind of tidying up. - Okay, what the hell? What the hell?
- 你要我把你丢上去还是你自己跳  - 我可以跳012---- You want me to actually throw you...? - I can hop.
告诉我，〝没有约会的约定〞 对你们的意义为何012---Now, tell me something, what does the phase "no-date pact" mean to you?
我真的很抱歉，好吗？012---Look, I'm sorry, okay?
只是钱德约了人 菲比也约了人012---It's just that Chandler has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.
我就想说问问好笑巴比012---I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
- 你的前男友 好笑巴比 - 对012---- Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend, Fun Bobby? - Yeah.
你还知道第二个好笑巴比吗012---You know more than one Fun Bobby?
我刚好还认识一个好笑巴伯012---I happen to know a Fun Bob.
好了012---Okay. Here we go.

我在店里遇见一位很辣的单亲妈妈012---Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. Ha, ha.
不然小精灵还能做什么？012---What's an elf to do?
所以球落下的时候…012---Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone...
只有我会孤单一人012---...when the ball drops?
别这样，我们会办个大派对 没有人会知道谁的伴是谁012---Oh, come on. We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.
我现在真的不需要应付这些012---Hey, you know, this is so not what I needed now.
- 怎么了 - 噢，是马塞尔012---- What's the matter? - Oh, it's Marcel.
他一直拒我于门外012---He keeps shutting me out, you know?
老是拖着双手，走来走去012---He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.
太奇怪了，我前几晚 跟他玩得很开心012---That's so weird. I had such a blast with him the other night.
- 是吗？ - 是啊，我们一起玩，还看电视012---- Really? - Yeah, we played. We watched TV.
杂耍那部分实在太棒了012---That juggling thing is amazing.
什么…012---What, uh?
什么杂耍？012---What juggling thing?
拿袜子当球耍啊 我以为是你教的012---With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
不是012---No.
其实没什么大不了的 只是袜子球而已012---You know, it wasn't that big a deal. I mean, just balled-up socks.
和一颗香瓜012---And a melon.

不…我不想知道，绝对不想知道012---No, I don't want to know. Absolutely not.
我认为直到它呱呱落地后…012---No, I think you shouldn't know until you look down there...
看，“它出来了”012---...and see, "Oh, there it is."
或是没有012---Or isn't.
- 哦，你好，罗斯 - 苏珊012---- Oh. Hello, Ross. - Susan.

苏珊012---Susan.
该先打电话给谁？ 你父母还是戴文罗马纳012---All right, who should we call first? Your folks or Deb and Rhona?
喂？012---Hello?
呃…012---ROSS: Uh...
算了，我不想知道012---Never mind. I don't wanna know.
因为那是我的桌子 我就得买一张新的？012---Okay, so just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
那是规定012---That's the rule.
什么规定？根本就没规定012---What rule? There's no rule.
如果有，你欠我一张桌子012---If anything, you owe me a table.
你怎会这样认为？012---How did you get there?
这张桌子是你和安琪拉012---I believe this piece of furniture was fine...
在“早餐冒险”时弄坏的012---...until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delveccio.
你知道那件事012---You knew about that?
从你们在奶油上留下的痕迹012---The impressions you made in the butter...

什么意思  一起买012---What do you mean, like, buy it together?
对012---Yeah.
你认为我们准备好了吗012---Do you think we're ready for something like that?
有何不可  这是个很重要的承诺012---- Why not? - Well, it's just a big commitment.
如果有人想搬出呢012---I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
为什么 你想搬出去  我没想要搬012---- Why, are you moving out? - I'm not moving out.
你想搬时会告诉我 对不012---You'd tell me if you were moving out, right?
对，因为我上个室友基普…012---Yes, it's just that, with my last roommate...
基普的事我全知道012---Oh, I know all about Kip.
我们合买了日式小炭炉012---We bought a hibachi together,
后来他结婚搬出去012---and then he ran off and got married...
我们闹得很不愉快012---...and things got pretty ugly.
我问你012---So let me ask you something.
基普是个比我好的室友吗？012---Was Kip a better roommate than me?
求你别问012---Oh, don't do that.
你的工作表稍有调整012---You've got a couple changes in your schedule.
四点的药草按摩延到四点半012---Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30.

我要，呃…012---Uh, I am, uh...
…脱光吗？012---...being naked?
你自己决定012---Um, that's really your decision.
有些人喜欢脱衣…裸体012---I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...
喔！裸体012---Ooh, oops! Being naked.
我无法想像你不愿知道012---I can't believe you don't want to know.
我受不了不知道012---I mean, I could not know.
如果医生知道 卡萝知道,苏珊知道…012---I mean, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...
摩妮卡也知道012---And Monica knows.
你怎会知道？连我都不知道012---Heh. How could you? I don't even know.

抱歉，我只是 快当姑姑而兴奋过度012---I'm sorry. I'm just excited about being an aunt.
或是叔叔012---Or an uncle.
嘿，菲比…012---GROUP: Hey, Phoebe. Hey, Pheebs.
还好012---Fine.
菲比，怎么了012---Phoebe, what's the matter?
没事，抱歉012---Nothing. I'm sorry.
我只是…我心情不好012---I'm just... I'm out of sorts.
能端杯卡布其诺过来吗012---Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
糟了，是我012---Oh, right. That's me.
钱德，卖桌子的七点关门012---Hey, Chandler. That table place closes at 7. Come on.
那好012---Fine.
菲比，怎么了012---Phoebe. What is it?
- 好吧，你们认识保罗吧？ - 他那一招我很清楚012---- You know Paolo? - I'm familiar with his work, yes.
他勾引我012---Look, he made a move on me.
- 店明天还会再开 - 再来杯咖啡012---- Whoa. The store will be open tomorrow. - More coffee over here, please.
怎么了？012---Well, what happened?
他来店里按摩012---Well, he came in for a massage...
一开始没事后来…012---...and everything was fine until...
- 天啊 - 你确定？012---- My God. - Are you sure?
确定012---Oh, yeah. I'm sure.
他的手突然不再是问题了012---And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.
是吗？012---Was it?
幼童军都能在那儿露营了012---Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

谢了，瑞秋012---Thanks, Rach.
- 你有何打算？ - 你得告诉她012---- What are you gonna you do? - You have to tell her.
你得告诉她 这是当朋友和女人基本的义务012---You have to tell her. It's your moral obligation as a friend...
我认为这是女性主义的议题 各位男士012---...as a woman. I think it's a feminist issue. Guys? Guys?
对，你得告诉她012---Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
女性主义？ 我也曾遭遇过012---Feminist issue? That's where I went.
她会恨我的012---She is gonna hate me.
是吗012---Yeah, well.
随便挑一张好吗012---Will you pick one? Just pick one.
这个如何012---Here, how about that one?
这是庭院家具012---That's patio furniture.
那又怎样  人家进门后会认为 “我又在外面”吗012---So what? Like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again."
行012---Fine.
鸟呢012---What about the birds?
我不知道  鸟不会说：012---I don't know. Birds just don't say:
哈罗，坐这儿，吃点东西012---"Hello, sit here. Eat something."
你挑一张吧012---You pick one.
好，瓢虫呢012---How about the ladybugs?
抛下鸟不管，只因红色昆虫 可以增加食欲？012---Oh, so forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining?
行，你想买鸟，就买鸟吧012---Fine. Do you want the birds? Get the birds.
别以为我不会012---Not like that, I won't.
基普一定是喜欢鸟的012---Kip would've liked the birds.
- 嗨 - 嗨，菲比012---- Hey. - Hi, Pheebs.
你要搬走012---Are you moving out?
不是，这些不全是我的行李箱012---No, these aren't all of my suitcases.
这是保罗的012---This one's Paolo's.
唔012---Um...
瑞秋，能和你谈谈吗？012---Um, Rachel, can we talk for a sec?
当然，但只能聊一会儿012---Well, sure. Just for a sec, though...
…因为保罗马上就来  - 噢012---...because Paolo's on his way over. - Oh.
好的，唔…012---Okay. Um...
好的012---Okay.
唔…012---Um...
- 哦，菲比… - 唔，好的012---- Oh, Pheebs... - Um, okay.
我们认识的时间并不是很久012---Um, ahem. We haven't known each other for that long a time.
你应该知道我的三件事012---And, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
第一，在我生命中朋友是最重要012---One, my friends are the most important thing in my life.
第二，我从不说谎012---Two, I never lie.
第三，我做的燕麦葡萄干饼干天下第一012---And three, I make the best oatmeal-raisin cookies in the world.
谢谢，菲比012---Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.
天啊012---Mm, my God.
我怎么没吃过012---Why have I never tasted these before?
我并不常做012---Oh, I don't make them a lot...
因为这样 对其他饼干太不公平了012---...because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies.
嗯，老天012---Ahem, God.
你说得对，这是我吃过 最好吃的燕麦葡萄干饼干012---Well, you're right. These are the best oatmeal-raisin cookies I've ever had.
- 这证明我绝不说谎 - 没错012---- Which proves that I never lie. - I guess you don't.
保罗向我调情012---Paolo made a pass at me.
那，你认为如何012---So, what do you think?
这是我见过最漂亮的桌子012---I think it's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
我知道012---I know.
怎么用？012---So how does this work?
打算用这些小头平衡盘子012---Gonna balance the plates on these little heads?
谁在乎 我们在水槽吃 来吧012---Who cares? We'll eat at the sink. Come on.
加油，罗斯012---Heads up, Ross.
得分，你们好烂012---Score! You suck.
你还好吧？012---Are you okay?
我要喝牛奶012---I need some milk.
我有牛奶012---I've got milk.
来了012---Here you go.
好点没012---Better?
没有012---No.
我觉得自己好愚蠢012---Ugh! I feel so stupid.
我想起前几天和你们在一起时012---I think about the other day, with you guys, you know.
我总是说：“保罗，他好棒012---And I was all, "Oh, Paolo. He's so great.
他让我好…” 噢！012---He makes me feel so..." Ugh!
天012---God.
真是丢人012---I'm so embarrassed.
我也觉得丢人012---I'm so embarrassed.
他的目标是我012---I'm the one he hit on.
菲比，都是我造成的 如果我不认识他012---I unleashed him on you. If I'd never met him...
你就不会发生这种事012---...this would've never happened.
- 对不起 - 不，对不起…012---- I'm so sorry. - No, I'm sorry.
对不起012---BOTH: No, I'm sorry.
等等012---Oh, wait. Oh.
- 我们在抱歉什么？ - 我也不知道012---- What are we sorry about? - I don't know.
对，他是一条猪012---Right. He's the pig.
- 大色猪 - 他是一头大色猪012---- Such a pig. - Oh, God, he's such a pig.
- 哦，他是… 一条恶心的猪 - 对，像…012---- Oh, he's like a big disgusting pig... - Yeah, like a...
- 猪人 - 说得好012---- Pig man. - Yes, good. Okay.
但他是我的猪人012---Oh, but he was my pig man.
为何我之前没感觉到012---How did I not see this?
我知道了012---Oh, I know!
因为…012---Because...
他是个迷死人的012---...he's gorgeous.
大帅哥012---And he's charming.
- 当他看着你时… - 够了,菲比012---- And when he looks at you... - Okay. Okay, Pheebs.
到此为止012---The end.
天啊012---Ugh. God.
我不该告诉你吗012---Should I not have told you?
不，相信我 还是让我知道比较好012---No, trust me, it's much better that I know.
但我比较喜欢从前 从前比较好012---Uh, I just liked it better before. It was better.
我想她已坦然接受012---I think she took it pretty well.
保罗在那儿012---You know, Paolo's over there right now, so...
我们该过去看她的情况如何012---Yeah, we should get over there and see if she's okay.
等等012---Just one second.
- 喔，得分 - 我们赢了012---- Whoo! Score. - Game. Us.
是啊012---Yes.
走吧，菲比012---Come on, Pheebs.
呼012---Whoo.
看来我们痛宰你们了012---Well, it looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
才怪，是她痛宰我们012---No, no. She kicked our butts.
你只能算是观众012---You could be on the Olympic "Standing There" team.
来嘛，两个对一个012---Come on. Two on one.
你为何还待在这儿？ 她刚和人分手012---What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy.
现在正是你趁虚而入的时候012---It's time for you to swoop in.
什么？现在？012---What? Now?
没错，现在趁虚而入012---Yes. Now is when you swoop.
你得成为保罗走后012---You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out...
瑞秋看见的第一个男人012---...the first guy Rachel sees is you.
她必须知道你拥有 他没有的一切012---She's got to know that you're everything he's not.
就像“反保罗”一样012---You're like... Like the anti-Paolo.
我这位天主教朋友说得没错012---My Catholic friend is right.
她伤心欲绝时 你在她身旁守候着012---She's distraught. You're there for her.
收拾残局 然后堂堂迈入012---You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in:
“罗斯年代”012---The Age of Ross.
等等…012---RACHEL: See this? See?
- 怎么了？ - 别看012---- How's it going? MONICA: Don't stare.
她刚把衣服倒完012---She just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony.
现在只剩“短兵相接”012---Now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving.
这是代表“你竟敢” 或是“波霸”012---Okay, that is either, "How could you?" Or "Enormous breasts."
他进来了012---Here he comes.
我是…012---Uh, I am, uh...
…来道别的012---...to say goodbye.
再见012---Oh, okay, bye-bye.
保罗012---Paolo.
我痛恨你背叛瑞秋 但我还有五份012---I really hate you for what you did to Rachel. But I still have five of these...
所以以375度加热 直到起司冒泡012---...so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
谢谢012---Thanks
保罗，我只想告诉…012---Paolo, I just wanna tell you...
我代表大家发言…012---...and I think I'd speak for everyone when I say...
你们看她012---PHOEBE: Oh. Just look at her.
各位，我认为一个人…012---Oh, you guys, I really think only one of us should go out there...
…应该出去安慰她 - 你说的对012---...so she's not overwhelmed. - Oh, right.
而且那个人就是我012---And I really think it should be me.
嘿012---BOTH: Hey.
你还好吧012---You all right?
好多了012---Oh. I've been better.
过来012---Come here.
听着012---Listen...
你应得到更好的对象012---...you deserve so much better than him.
懂吗  我是说，一个…012---You know? I mean, you...
懂得珍惜你的人在一起012---You should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
罗斯012---Ross...
什么？012---What?
我已对男生感到厌烦012---I'm so sick of guys.
我不要再看到男生了012---I don't want to look at another guy.
不要再想男生012---I don't want to think about another guy.
不要再接近男生了012---I don't even want to be near another guy.

- 你还好吧？ - 你还好吧？012---MONICA: Are you all right? PHOEBE: Are you okay?
一半一半012---Medium. Heh.
饼干还有剩吗  有012---- Any cookies left? - Yeah.
呃，看吧，瑞秋012---Heh. See, Rach, um...
诅咒全天下的男生并不能解决问题 不能一竿子打翻一船人012---See, I don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't.
你应该发展出更精密的审检方式012---I think what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
不，我只想暂时自己一个人012---No. No. I just need to be by myself for a while.
想清楚自己真正要的什么012---You know? I just gotta figure out what I want.
不012---No, no.
并非全天下的男人 都和保罗一样012---See, because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo.
我知道012---No, I know. I know.
我也相信你儿子长大后 不会和他一样012---And I'm sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.
- 什么？ - 什么？012---- What? - What?
我生了个儿子？012---I'm having a boy?
哦，不是012---Uh, no.
不，实际上，你没生儿子012---No. In fact, you're not having a boy.
我生了个儿子012---I'm having a boy.
我生了个儿子？012---Am I having a boy?

嗨012---Hey.
我们早就知道了012---We already knew that.
我生了个儿子012---I'm having a son.
唔…012---Um...
这叫“停工”012---Yes. And that would be a shutdown.
“对方零分”012---Shutout!
你们再干什么？再来一局012---Where you guys going? Come on, one more game.

- 再来一局 - 来吧012---- One more game? - Oh, yeah.
- 抱歉 - 天啊，我受够了012---- I'm sorry. - Oh, my God. That's it.
你不敲门就闯进来012---You just barge in here and you don't knock?
难道你不尊重别人的隐私权012---You have no respect for anybody's privacy.
- 瑞秋，你等一下   - 不，你等一下012---- Rachel, wait.  - No, you wait.
- 我能说一件事吗    - 什么事012---- Can I just say one thing? - What? What?
这块布编得非常松 我仍能看见…012---That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your...
- 你的两点   - 哦！012---...nippular area. - Ugh!

你知道吗012---You know?
例如电话响时她就去洗澡012---Like when the phone rings and she takes a shower...
差不多就是那样012---That's pretty much it.
但你说得很好，甜心012---But you tell it really well, sweetie.

以一位精神科医师来讲 不会太神经质012---And for a shrink, he's not too "shrinky." You know?
他会在沙发上做吗012---So you think you'll do it on his couch?
我不知道…有点奇怪012---Oh. I don't know. That's a little weird.
聚乙稀做的012---It's vinyl.
好，大家还想要别的东西吗012---Okay. You guys want anything else? - Oh, yes.
- 要，我要… - 抱歉，卖完了012---- Could I have...? - Sorry, we're all out.
其他人呢？012---Anybody else? - Okay.
我是否错过什么事012---Did I, uh, miss something?
她很生气 因为我看见她的乳房012---No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
你是怎么看到她的乳房的012---What were you doing seeing her boobies?
那是意外012---It was an accident.
这跟拿望远镜 和甜甜圈过街的感觉不同012---I wasn't across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts.
能换个话题吗012---Can we change the subject, please?
没错，因为那不是她的乳房 而是她的胸部012---Because, hello? These aren't her "boobies." These are her breasts.
菲比，我要的不只是改变说法012---Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
你为什么要难为情呢？ 你的乳房还蛮不错的012---I don't know why you're embarrassed. They were very nice boobies.
〝不错〞？012---"Nice"?
它们很〝不错〞？012---They were "nice"?
就这样？手套也很不错012---That's it? I mean, mittens are "nice."
好，我真是…012---Okay. Rock, hard place...
左右为难012---...me.
你真搞笑012---You're so funny.
他真的很搞笑012---He's really funny.
他不讲笑话的时候 我可不想待在这里012---I wouldn't want to be there when the laughter stops.
等等，回去上一句012---Whoa, whoa. Back up there, sparky.
那是什么意思？012---What did you mean by that?
你似乎有亲密上的问题012---It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues...
你用你的幽默和人保持距离012---...that you use your humor to keep people at a distance.
呵012---Huh.
我是说，我才刚认识你 我也从来没听说过你012---I mean, hey, I just met you. I don't know you from Adam.
独生子，对吧？012---Only child, right?
父母在你青春期前离婚？012---Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
你怎会知道？012---Uh-huh. How did you know?
典型课本范例012---It's textbook.
各位012---Hey, you guys.
你们都认识我爸吧？012---You all know my dad, right?
- 打算在纽约待多久？ - 就几天012---- How long are you in the city? - A couple of days.
我在市中心有工作012---I got a job midtown.
我想和我儿子一起住012---I figure I'm better off staying with the kid...
比来回坐渡轮好012---...than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.
我没见过他012---I don't know this one.
- 他是我朋友罗杰 - 嗨012---- Oh. This is my friend Roger. - Hi.
- 幸会，罗杰 - 彼此彼此012---- Good to meet you. ROGER: You too.
玩布偶的那个怎么了？012---What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
爸012---- Dad, uh... - Oh, oh.
抱歉012---Excuse me.
罗斯，你老婆还好吗012---So, Ross, uh, how's the wife?
哪壶不开提哪壶了012---Oh for two, huh? Heh.
钱德，快点，说点好笑的012---Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny.
我得挂电话了 我也想你012---Gotta go. Ha, ha. I miss you too.
我爱你，但现在很晚了012---I love you, but it's getting late now...
让我向她打声招呼 嘿，妈012---Let me say hi. Hey, Ma.
我和包西达大夫约了时间 而且…012---Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bassida and...
什么012---Excuse me?
你知道这不是妈妈吗012---Did you know this isn't Ma?
她叫罗妮012---Her name's Ronni.
她从事宠物殡葬业012---She's a pet mortician.
好012---Sure.
你和她多久了…012---So how long have you been...
记得小时候我常带你 去海军军港…012---Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the Navy yard...
看大船？012---...and show you the big ships?
- 从那时候就开始了  - 没有，才六年012---- Since then? - No, it's only been six years.
我只想勾起你美好的回忆012---I wanted to give you a nice memory...
让你不会觉得 我一直是个王八蛋012---...so you'd know I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
乔伊，你爱过吗？012---Joe, have you ever been in love?
我不知道012---I don't know.
那就是没有012---Then you haven't.
- 你的蕃茄烧焦了 - 你还好意思说我012---- You're burning your tomatoes. - Hmm. You're one to talk.
乔，你老爸爱得无法自拔012---Joe, your dad's in love, bigtime.
最糟的是我爱上两个不同的女人012---And the worst part is, it's with two different women.
天啊，拜托你告诉我 其中一个是妈012---Oh, man. Please tell me one of them is Ma.
当然其中一个是你妈 你秀逗了？012---Of course one of them's Ma. What's the matter with you?
这就像你某天起床突然发现012---It's like if you woke up one day and found out...
你老爸是个双面人012---...your dad was leading this double life.
好像是为中央情报局工作的间谍012---He's, like, actually some spy working for the CIA.
那到挺酷的012---That'd be cool.
这实在是太逊了012---This blows.
我知道，为何父母就不能 好好当父母012---I know. Why can't parents just stay parents?
为何他们就得成为一般人012---Why do they have to become people?
为何他们要…012---Why do they have...?
为什么…012---Why...
你能不能不要一直盯着 我的胸部看012---...can't you stop staring at my breasts?
什么？012---What?
什么？012---What?
那一天你还看得不够吗？012---Didn't you get a good enough look the other day?
好了…我们都已是成年人012---All right, we're all adults here.
此事只有一个解决方法012---There's only one way to resolve this.
既然你看过她的乳房012---Since you saw her boobies...
你应该让她看你的小鸡鸡012---...I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee.
想都别想012---You know, I don't see that happening.
快点，他说得没错 以眼还眼012---Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.
我不会让你看的012---Well I'm not showing you my tat.
谁啊？012---Hello?
- 是菲比 - 还有罗杰！012---PHOEBE: It's Phoebe. ROGER: And Rog.
快上来012---Come on up.
这下可好，罗杰来了012---Oh, good. Rog is here.
- 罗杰怎么了  - 没什么，小事012---- What's the matter with Rog? - Nothing. It's a little thing.
我讨厌这家伙012---I hate that guy.
为什么 因为他太善于分析 这是职业病啊012---What? So he was a little analytical. That's what he does.
拜托，他没那么糟012---Come on, he's not that bad.
你这里错了！ 如果当初我感觉到她是蕾丝边…012---That's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her...
我何必和她结婚呢？012---...if I thought on any level that she was a lesbian?
我也不确定012---I don't know.
或许你想让你的婚姻失败012---Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
- 呵呵 - 为什么 我为什么会这么做012---- Ha, ha. - Why? Why would I? Why?
为什么…为什么012---Why? Why? Why?
我也不确定，或许自信心不足012---I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?
或许是弥补你抢兄弟姊妹风头的事情 或许…012---Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe...
等等，回到兄弟姊妹的话题012---Wait. Go back to that "sibling" thing.
嗯，我不知道012---Well, I don't know.
你让你的婚姻碰壁012---It's conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage...
好显示你兄弟姊妹在父母面前 没那么失败012---...so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents' eyes.
这太荒谬了 她不成才我一点都不会感到内疚012---That's ridiculous. I don't feel guilty for her failures.
- 你认为我不成才  - 他不错吧012---- Oh, so you think I'm a failure? - Isn't he good?
不，我不是那个意思012---Yeah. No. That's not what I was saying.
多年来我以为你支持我012---All these years, I thought you were on my side...
但或许你婚姻失败的目的是 想巴结爸妈012---...but maybe you were sucking up to Mom and Dad...
好让他们更心疼你012---...so they'd favor you.
嘿，我娶蕾丝边 是想让你看起来更好012---Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good.
你说得对012---You're right.
我说，你说得对012---I mean, you're right.
那不是威伯的问题 而是威伯游乐宫012---It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace...
和威伯游轮的问题012---...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...
它上面的救生艇让威伯能缓缓驶出012---...which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
那很难受012---That's tough, tough stuff.
菲比，我们现在该走了 不然就赶不上电影了012---Pheebs, if we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.
希望你好过一点，瑞秋012---Okay. Feel better, okay?
菲比，我们快来不及了 甜心012---We're gonna be late, sweetie. - Okay.
- 谢谢你做的一切，摩妮卡 - 不客气012---- Listen, thanks for everything, Mon. - No problem.
各位，很高兴和各位再度见面012---It was great seeing you again.
摩妮卡，饼干别吃太多012---Mon, uh, easy on those cookies, okay?
切记，那些东西只是食物…012---Remember, they're just food...
不是爱012---...they're not love.
我讨厌这家伙012---I hate that guy.
晚安，各位012---JOEY: Good night, you guys.
看，这是我们订的女人012---Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.
嘿，需要帮忙吗012---Hey. Can, uh... Can we help you?
不用，谢谢，我在等乔伊崔比亚尼012---Oh. No, thanks. I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
我就是乔伊崔比亚尼012---I'm Joey Tribbiani.
喔，不是你，是老乔伊012---Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你比照片上帅多了012---You're so much cuter than your pictures.
我是罗妮012---I'm Ronni.
想吃起起司片吗？012---Cheese Nip?
乔伊的脑子有点秀逗了012---Uh, Joey's having an embolism...
但我要起司片012---...but I'd go for a Nip.
大部分人在宠物过世后012---You see, most people, when their pets pass on...
希望他们像睡觉那样躺着012---...they want them laid out like they're sleeping.
但有时有些人要他们摆出姿势012---But occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.
像追自己的尾巴012---Like, uh, chasing their tail.
或跳起来接住飞盘012---Or, uh, jumping to catch a Frisbee.
乔伊，如果我先走一步 我的姿势要像找钥匙一样012---Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.
- 好好笑！ - 嗨！乔012---- That's a good one. - Hey, Joe.
嗨，爸爸，罗妮来了012---Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.
- 嗨 - 嘿012---- Huh? - Hi.
- 嘿 - 嘿012---- Hey. - Hey.
嘿，亲爱的012---Hello, babe.
你来做什么012---What are...? What are you doing here?
你的假发留在我的住处012---Oh, uh, you left your hair at my apartment.
我想你明天开会用得上012---I figured you'd need it for your meeting.
谢谢012---Thank you. Uh...
谁想玩大老二012---So who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
听着，我…012---Look, I, uh...
我不该来这里012---I shouldn't have come.
我该走了，我不想错过最后一班地铁012---I gotta go. I'll miss the last train.
不，我不想让你这么晚还搭地铁012---No, I don't want you taking that thing this late.
- 那我要睡哪里  这里吗  - 喔012---- Where am I gonna stay? Here? - Whoa.
我们去住饭店012---We'll go to a hotel.
我们去住饭店012---We'll go to a hotel.
- 不行 - 不行012---- No, you won't. - No, we won't.
你们去饭店就一定会嘿咻012---If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.
我要你们待在这里 这样我就可以盯着你们012---I want you right here, where I can keep an eye on you.
你要盯着我们012---You're gonna keep an eye on us?
没错，先生012---That's right, mister.
不管你年纪多大 只要住在我家屋檐下…012---I don't care how old you are, while you're here...
一切就得听我的012---...you're gonna live by my rules.
那就是不准你和 你女朋友睡在一起012---And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
哇，他好严格012---Wow, he's strict.
爸，你睡我房问012---Dad, you'll be in my room.
罗妮 你睡钱德的房问012---Ronni, uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
谢谢 你真是个好孩子012---Thanks. You're a good kid.
来，我带你去看我房间012---Come on. I'll show you to my room.
感觉真奇怪 你没说 〝不，谢了，时候不早了〞012---That sounds weird when it's not followed by, "No, thanks, it's late."
好，只有今晚而已 明天你就得做出改变012---Okay. This is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.
- 六年时间可不短 - 什么改变？012---- Six years is long enough. - What kind of change?
- 和罗妮分手 - 我不能！012---- Break up with Ronni... - I can't.
要不就和我妈离婚 这样是不对的012---Then come clean with Ma. This is not right.
- 对，但是… - 我不想听，快进我房里012---I don't wanna hear it. Now go to my room.
嘿，踢踏舞者012---Hey, kickie.
- 你在干什么？ - 想让自己舒服一点012---- What are you doing? - Trying to get comfortable.
- 穿着内裤我睡不着 - 你非穿不可012---- I can't sleep in my underwear. - Well, you're gonna.
我一直在想…012---I've been thinking...
我总是看见女人叠在女人上面012---...about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.
她们是尾对尾相接 还是是像煎饼一样叠起来012---Are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes?
你知道我什么意思 这些和我约过会的女人012---You know what I mean. How I date all these women.
因为我总是想 当真命天女出现时012---I always figured, when the right one comes along...
我就会勇往直前，坚持到最后012---...I'll be able to be a standup guy and go the distance, you know?
但如今看见我爸 我想…012---Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking...
你不是他，你是你自己012---You're not him, you're you.
当他们希望你继承你爸的事业时 你有屈服吗012---When they wanted you to go into your father's business, did you cave?
- 没有 - 没有012---- No. - No.
你决心从事没有工作的 演艺事业012---You decided to go into the out-of-work-actor business.
这不是一件容易的事 但你办到了012---That wasn't easy, but you did it.
我也相信 当真命天女出现时012---And I believe that when the right woman comes along...
你会有勇气对她说012---...you'll have the guts to say:
〝抱歉，我已婚〞012---"No thanks, I'm married."
你真的这样认为012---You really think so?
真的，我真的这样认为012---Yeah. I really do.
- 谢谢，钱德 - 滚开012---- Thanks, Chandler. - Get off.
- 嗨 - 嗨012---- Hi. - Hi.
有事吗？012---May I help you?
乔伊说我能用你的浴室 因为钱德正在用我们的012---Uh, Joey said I could use your shower since, uh, Chandler's in ours.
好，你是谁？012---Okay. Who are you?
我叫罗妮 罗妮·罗普拉诺012---- Oh, uh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono. - Uh-huh.
情妇？012---The mistress?
- 请进 - 谢谢012---- Um, come on in. - Thanks.
我叫瑞秋，浴室在那里012---Hi, I'm Rachel. Bathroom's up there.
嘿，听好，罗妮012---Hey, Ronni.
钱德进浴室多久了？012---How long has Chandler been in the shower?
大约五分钟012---Oh. Like, uh, five minutes.
太好了012---Perfect.
请系好安全带012---Fasten your seat belts...
看小鸡鸡的时间到了012---...it's pee-pee time.
嘿，崔比亚尼先生012---Hey, Mr. Trib.
嘿，早安，亲爱的012---Hey. Good morning, dear.
钱德宾，该换我看你的小东西了012---Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing.
- 你是怎么搞的  - 我以为你是钱德012---- What's the matter with you? - I thought it was Chandler.
你应该在浴室 这样我才能看见你的小东西012---You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing.
抱歉，我的小东西在里面 和我在一起012---Sorry, my thing was in there with me.
- 嘿 - 嘿，菲比012---PHOEBE: Hey. ALL: Hey, Pheebs.
- 还好吧？ - 不错012---MONICA: How's it going? - Good. Oh, oh.
罗杰想邀大家一起吃晚餐012---Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
- 怎么了？ - 没事012---- So, what's going on? - Nothing.
只是…012---It's just that, uh...
是罗杰012---It's Roger.
我不知道，有些事…012---Um, ahem, I don't know. There's something about... Ahem.
基本上我们认为他…012---Basically, we just feel that he's, uh...
我们讨厌他012---We hate that guy.
我们讨厌他012---We hate him.
- 菲此，我们很抱歉 - 好吧012---We're sorry, Pheebs.
嗯哼，对012---Uh-huh. Okay.
是不是他太有洞察力012---Don't you think maybe it's just that he's so perceptive...
所以吓到你们了012---...that it freaked you out?
不，我们讨厌他…012---- No, I hate him. - No, we hate him.
抱歉012---I'm sorry.
妈，你来干什么？012---Ma. What are you doing here?
我把这个带给你012---I came to give you this...
还有这个012---...and this. - Ow.
你的大戒指打到很痛！012---Big ring.
你为什么要对你爸讲一大堆012---Why did you fill your father's head with that garbage...
关于改邪归正的废话呢？012---...about making things right?
- 切事情本来都很好012---Things were fine the way they were.
里面有鸡肉，放冰箱冰好012---There's chicken in there. Put it away.
拜托，乔伊，真的012---For God's sake, Joey. Really.
等一下，你都知道012---Hold on. You knew?
我当然知道  你认为呢012---Of course I knew. What do you think?
你爸又不是詹姆士庞德012---Your father is no James Bond.
你应该听听他的谎言012---You should have heard his cover stories.
〝我在会计家里睡〞012---"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's."
那是什么屁话 拜托012---I mean, what is that? Please.
你怎能…012---So then, how could you...?
记得你爸以前的模样吗012---Do you remember how your father used to be?
总是大呼大叫，总是不开心012---Always yelling. Nothing made him happy.
连工作室和 瓶内的小船也无法让他开心012---Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.
现在他很开心012---Now he's happy.
这样很好，他好歹有个嗜好012---I mean, it's nice. He has a hobby.
妈，我无意冒犯 但是…012---Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but...
你到底在说什么012---...what the hell are you talking about?
- 我是说，那你怎么办？ - 我很好啊012---- I mean, what about you? - Me? I'm fine.
听着，亲爱的…012---Look, honey...
在理想的世界中012---...in an ideal world...
没有她 而且你爸是个大帅哥012---...there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting.
再告诉你别的012---And I'll tell you something else:
自从那贵妇犬一样的女人出现后012---Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along...
他感觉很羞耻 变得对我很用心012---...he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.
并且开始对我体贴012---He's been more loving.
每天都像我们的结婚纪念日012---It's like every day is our anniversary.
我该为你高兴？012---I'm happy for you?
不必了012---Well, don't be.
因为现在全搞砸了012---Because now everything's screwed up.
我只想回到像从前一样012---I just want it the way it was.
妈，对不起012---JOEY: Ma, I'm sorry.
我以为我做了你想做的事012---I just did what I thought you'd want.
我知道，亲爱的，我知道012---I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did.
告诉我012---So tell me...
你见到她了吗012---Did you see her?
见到了012---Yeah.
你比她漂亮十倍都不止012---You're 10 times prettier than she is.
嘴巴真甜012---That's sweet.
我打得过她吗012---Could I take her?
你有这么大的戒指，她没辙012---With this ring, no contest.
- 怎么了 甜心 - 没事012---ROGER: What's wrong, sweetie? PHOEBE: Nothing.
到底怎么了 快说嘛012---No, no. What's wrong? Come on.
好吧012---Okay.
好吧，我…没事012---It's nothing. I'm fine.
只是我的朋友012---It's just, um... It's my friends.
他们对你有意见012---They have a liking problem with you...
其实…012---...in that, um...
他们不喜欢你…012---...they don't.
他们不喜欢我012---Oh. They don't?
不过，你知道…012---But you know...
他们看不见 只有我才能看见的好处012---...they don't see all of the wonderfulness that I see.
他们看不见你体贴的一面012---They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.
他们认为你有点…012---They think you're a little...
- 什么  - 执着的恐怖012---- What? - Intense and creepy.
噢012---Oh.
但我，菲比不这么认为012---But I don't. Me. Phoebe.
我对他们的反应 丝毫不感到惊讶012---Well, I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
不惊讶吗？ 这就是你棒的地方012---You're not? See, that's why you're so great.
当群体动力失调时012---Actually, it's quite typical behavior...
这是很平常的反应012---...when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
这种相互依赖…012---You know, this kind of codependent...
情绪障碍012---...emotionally stunted...
坐在那家烂咖啡屋 拿着又大又蠢的咖啡杯012---...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups...
或许还有乳头在上面012---...which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them.
你们都会说：〝噢，定义我的性格 定义我的性格012---And you're all like, "Oh, define me. Define me.

我只是想…012---And just think...

蛋？012---An egg?
对，你就上前跟她说 蛋还你012---Yeah. Go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back. I'm returning your egg."

菲比，不行，你难道忘了 当初为什么甩掉他的012---No. Pheebs. Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?

- 今晚呢 - 不行，不准反悔012---- Oh. Uh, listen, about tonight... - No, no, don't you dare bail on me.
她答应跟我约会，就是因为 我答应帮她朋友找伴012---She's only going out with me because I'm bringing a friend for her friend.
但她朋友听来似乎是…012---But her friend sounds like such a...
可悲惨又很糟 这我知道，但…012---Pathetic mess. I know, but...
别这样啦，老兄，她很渴望 很脆弱012---Come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.

每次做爱都会哭的家伙 还记得吗？012---Remember the guy that used to cry every time we had sex?
〝你也舒服吗？〞012---"Oh, was it good for you?"
小哭一下何妨 总比不服输霍华〝强〞012---Well, I'd take a little crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy.
〝我赢了，我赢了〞012---"I win. I win."
跟他约会两个月 都没赢过012---I went out with him for two months. I didn't get to win once.
我们人这么好 怎会找到这些混蛋呢？012---How do we end up with these jerks? We're good people.
不知道，可能是因为 我们拥有特别磁力012---I don't know. I think we're like some kind of magnets.
我确定我有 所以我才不能戴数位手表012---I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.

或者…？012---Or?
或者可以脱光了又唱又跳 拿根木棍012---Or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
- 烧束西比较好 - 烧东西比较好012---- Burning's good. - Burning's good.
我有可以烧的东西012---RACHEL: I've got stuff to burn.
这个呢012---You know...
打从我小时候 我就有办法用脚趾捡硬币012---...ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
是吗？好了不起012---Yeah? Good for you.
几枚硬币 还是整捆硬币？012---Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?

真的吗？因为可以拿来 作成小玩偶012---Are you sure? Because you could make little puppets out of them.
然后放在残酷剧场演戏012---And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty.
不能这样012---We can't do that.
啥？不能怎样？012---What? What can't you do?
可以私下一聊？ 到那边？012---Uh, can I talk to you for a second? Over there?
我们想走了012---Uh, we might be leaving now.
你是说我跟你的我们012---Tell me it's you and me "we."
她说想在我全身涂抹东西 再舔掉012---She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.
但我连涂抹是什么意思都不懂012---I'm not even sure what slathering is.
但我很想试试012---But I definitely want to be a part of it.
你不可以这样对我012---Okay, you cannot do this to me.
没错，抱歉 没错012---You're right. I'm sorry. You're right.

裤子拉链跑出来012---...of your zipper since you came back from the bathroom.
不好意思012---Excuse me.
你好012---How you doing?
我们这算是误交损友吗？012---So do we have the best friends, or what?
乔伊算不上朋友 他是…012---Joey's not a friend. He's...
把信用卡留给我们用的笨蛋012---...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
再来一杯？点心？ 大屏幕电视机？012---Another drink? Some dessert? A big-screen TV?

〝亲爱的，你被开除了 不过上班前我们快快来一下如何〞012---"Sweetheart, you're fired. But how about a quickie before I go to work?"
- 好 - 好012---- Hey. - Hey.
既然人都进来了 就不用再敲门了012---Once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore.
我来开012---I'll get it.
黑考斯先生012---Oh. Hi, Mr. Heckles.
你们又在弄了012---You're doing it again.
我们什么都没弄啊012---We're not doing anything.
我们只是坐着静静聊天而已012---We're just sitting around talking quietly.
我天花板很吵012---I can hear you through the ceiling.
我的猫睡不着012---My cats can't sleep.
你根本没养猫啊012---You don't even have cats.
我本来可能养的012---I could have cats.
再见，黑考斯先生012---Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
我们会小声点012---We'll try to keep it down.
菲比，可以帮个忙吗012---Phoebe, can you do me a favor?
试穿一下看合不合身012---Try this on to make sure it fits.
我这辈子第一次收到的生日礼物 真的很…012---Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really...
不是啦，这是送乌苏拉的 但我想你们一样身材012---Oh, no, no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
没问题，好012---Oh. Sure. Yeah.
好，很合012---Okay, it fits.
你又要约她了吗？012---Are you seeing her again tonight?
对，冰上嘉年华012---Yep, Ice Capades.
你们玩真的012---Wow, this is serious.
我从没见过你肯 为女朋友花钱012---I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
不知道，我就是喜欢她啊012---I don't know. I like her.
她跟别人不同 她有某种特质012---She's different. There's, uh, something about her...
让你迷上她 懂了，你喜欢她，很好012---That you like. We get it. You like her. Great.
菲比，我事先问过你 你说没意见的啊012---Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
但现在有意见了012---Well, maybe now it's not okay.
好吧012---Okay.
但现在我对你有意见这事 很有意见了012---Well, maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
好吧012---Okay.
快织，好女人 快织012---Knit, good woman. Knit. Knit.
这边是克莱斯勒大楼012---And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
噢012---NINA: Oh.
- 妮娜 - 道格拉斯先生012---- Nina. - Mr. Douglas.
领带很正012---Cool tie.
她还在012---She's still here.
是，她还在012---Yes. Yes, she is.
我不是有附纸条给你报告过012---Didn't I memo you on this?
我开除她后，她的心理医师 法兰医师012---See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen...
发蓝医师012---...Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.
告知我，她对开除一事 适应不良012---And, uh, he informed me that she took the news rather badly.
还用了非常激动这样的字眼012---In fact, he, uh, mentioned the word "frenzy."
少开玩笑了 她明明就很…012---You're kidding. She seems so...
没有，妮娜吗？她…012---Oh, no, no. Nina? She's:
要是你去问她012---In fact, if you asked her now...
她对被开除一事 完全没有印象了012---...she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.
太不可置信了012---That's unbelievable.
却又很可信012---And yet believable.
所以我决定 在确定她不会伤害自己012---So I decided not to fire her again...
或其他人之前 不要再开除她一次012---...until I'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others.
好吧，人对事情的反应 真的很难预料012---I see. Hmm. You never really know what's going on inside a person's head.
所以才有心理学吧 老板012---Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.
这声音是爸妈都终生难忘的012---NARRATOR [ON TV]: The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.
毕竟，这是生产的奇迹012---For this, after all, is the miracle of birth.
请开灯012---TEACHER: Lights, please.
这就是生产的过程012---And that's having a baby.
下一周就是最后一堂课了012---Next week is our final class.
苏珊，往前跑012---Susan, go deep.
太了不起了 真是太了不起了012---CAROL: It's impossible. It's just impossible.
什么东西了不起？012---What is, honey?
刚才那女人…012---What that woman...
的表现012---...did.
我才不要经历那种事012---I am not doing that. Heh.
只要宝宝不生出来就好了 那就一切依旧012---It'll have to stay in, that's all. Everything will be the same.
- 只要不生出来 - 卡萝，亲爱的012---- It'll just stay in. Ha, ha. - Carol, honey. Shh.
- 会一切顺利的 - 你懂个屁012---- Everything will be all right. - What do you know?
又不会有人跟你说 那是你的鼻孔吗012---No one's saying to you, "Hi, is that your nostril?
可以把这肉块 从这推出去吗012---Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
卡萝，亲爱的012---Carol, sweetie.
深呼吸吐气012---Cleansing breath.
我知道这很吓人 但往想远一点012---I know it's frightening. But big picture:
生产不过是那短短一天012---The birth part is just one day...
等生完后，我们这辈子 就成了人家的父母了012---...and when it's over, we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives.
这么辛苦不就是为了这点吗012---SUSAN: I mean, that's what this is all about, right?
对吧，罗斯012---Ross?
罗斯012---Ross.
我要当爸爸了012---I'm gonna be a father.
- 你现在才想到吗  - 我是知道会有个孩子012---- This is just occurring to you? - I always knew I was having a baby.
只是一直没想到 孩子也会有我012---I just never realized the baby was having me.
你可以办到的012---Oh, you're gonna be great.
你怎么知道012---How could you say that?
我连叫马塞尔别吃浴室踏垫 都没办法了012---I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat.
要怎么养育小孩012---How will I raise a kid?
科学家说…012---You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying...
猴子和小孩是不一样的012---...that monkeys and babies are actually different.
- 去哪  - 出去012---- Where are you going? - Out.
跟谁？012---With?
是的012---Yes.
问你一件事012---All right, can I just ask you one question?
你们有那个了吗012---Have you two, you know, like, you know?
就那个012---You know?
有没012---Yet?
虽然这不干你事012---Well, not that it's any of your business...
但还没，可以吗012---...but no, we haven't, okay?
你是指做爱对吧012---You meant sex, right?
- 有空吧 - 有，妮娜，怎么了012---- Do you have a sec? - Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?
不知道，过去几天 大家都躲着我012---I don't know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me...
看到我表情都怪怪的012---...and giving me these really strange looks.
喔，可能是因为…012---Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because...
大家都嫉妒我们吧012---...they're, uh, jealous of us.
可能012---Maybe.
但他们收走剪刀 就说不通了吧012---But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
或许是因为要给你加薪了012---Uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise.
- 有吗？ - 当然，有可能啊012---- I am? - Sure. Why not?
天啊 你好棒012---Oh, my God. You're amazing.
还不只呢012---Oh, you don't know.
海伦，请记得布克邦德小姐 加薪的事文件要弄好012---Helen, make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.
那还要把她精神病历 送到人事处吗？012---HELEN [OVER INTERCOM]: Still want her psychological profile sent to personnel?
- 什么 - 海伦有酗酒问题012---- What? - Helen drinks.
愿意嫁给我吗012---Will you marry me?
- 最后我全盘托出 - 她反应如何？012---- Well, I ended up telling her everything. - Ooh. How'd she take it?
很好 除了钉书针012---Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.
小提示，要是遇到同样状况012---Little tip. If you're ever in a similar situation...
手千万别放在桌上012---...never, ever leave your hand on the desk.
我应该知道怎么操作了012---Okay, I think I get how to do this.
可以关掉吗  可以弄走吗012---Can we turn this off? Can we make them go away?
因为我看不下去012---Because I can't watch.
- 好了，菲比，关掉了 - 好012---- Okay, Pheebs, they're gone. - Okay.
你还好吗012---- Are you all right? - Yeah.
对，就乌苏拉那事012---It's just, you know, this whole stupid Ursula thing.
菲比，问你一句012---Okay, Pheebs, can I ask?
他跟她约会就 真的有这么糟吗012---So he's going out with her. Is it really so terrible?
有012---Um, yeah.
不是说她很坏什么的012---I mean, I'm not saying she's evil or anything.
但她老是坏了我的好事012---She's just, you know, always breaking my stuff.
我八岁时，不肯借她 儿童厨具组012---When I was 8, I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson Thermos...
她就把厨具扔到车底012---...so she threw it under the bus.
还有兰迪布朗012---And then there's Randy Brown...
他就…012---...who was like...
你们有过青梅竹马般的男友吗012---Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
- 没有 - 没012---- No. - No.
他就是我青梅竹马的男友012---Well, but that's what he was for me.
她却抢走他012---And she, you know, kind of stole him away...
却让他心碎012---...and then broke his heart.
之后他再也不理我了012---And then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore.
因为他说不想再看到 跟我们一样的人012---He didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us.
菲比012---Oh, Pheebs.
我清楚乔伊不是我男友 或儿童厨具组012---I mean, I know Joey's not my boyfriend or my Thermos...
或什么，但是…012---...or anything, but...
- 你不会失去他的 - 你要跟他谈开来012---- You won't lose him. - You gotta talk to Joey.
对，好012---Yeah, okay.
他不会懂你的想法 如果他知道你这么想012---Come on. He doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt...
他爱上她了啊012---He's falling in love with her.
拜托，才不过交往一周012---Oh, please. They've been going out a week.
连床都没上过 根本不算什么012---They haven't even slept together yet. I mean, that's not serious.
好吧012---Okay.
好012---Oh. Okay. Oh.
噢012---Oh.
有什么事吗012---Yeah, um, may we help you?
瑞秋，你干嘛啦  好冷喔 你到里头来好吗012---Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing. Would you come inside?
不要012---No, no, no.
是你叫我拆掉的012---You wanted me to take them down...
那我就来拆啊012---...so I'm taking them down, okay?
瑞秋012---Rachel!
瑞秋 - 没事012---I'm okay. I'm okay.
黑考斯先生012---Mr. Heckles?
黑考斯先生  帮帮我012---Mr. Heckles, could you help me, please?
我就说吧012---See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.

为什么要有 这要花多少钱啊？012---Why? How much is this gonna cost?
不知道，但光照X光 就可能要几百块012---I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
- 那要怎么办  - 那就什么也办不了了012---- What are we gonna do? - There's not much we can do.
不然用你的012---Uh, unless I use yours.

为什么012---Why?
我好笨012---I am really an idiot.
我帮我朋友填表格012---You see, I was filling out my friend's form...
但却填错了012---...and instead of putting her information...
填成我自己的012---...I put mine.
你真笨012---You are an idiot.
没错，我是 我真够笨的012---Yep, that's me. Heh. I am that stupid.
昨晚我梦到自己 跟儿子打美式足球012---I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
好甜蜜012---- That's nice. - That's nice.
不，是把他当成球012---No, no. With him.
我人在球场上 他们把小孩丢给我012---I'm on this field, and they hike me the baby.
《坦帕湾队》的防守球员直朝我冲来 我非采取行动不可012---I know I've gotta do something because the Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me.
《坦帕湾队》很差012---Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
是没错，但…012---Right, but...
我这队只有我和小孩 他们应该可以征服我们012---...it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinking they can take us.
所以我就…012---And so I, uh, heh...
把小孩扔到对方场地012---I just heave it downfield.
你疯了不成 那是小孩子耶012---What are you, crazy? That's a baby.
难不成要他被对方撞倒？012---He should take the sack?
总之… 突然间我来到对方场地012---Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.
这下换我要接住小孩了，对吧012---And I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right?
但我根本不可能来得及012---Only I know there's no way I'm not gonna get there in time.
所以我就一直跑012---So I am running and I'm running...
这时我却醒来了012---...and that is when I woke up.
我真的还没准备好 要当父亲012---See, I am so not ready to be a father.

老兄，要是我生日 你给我搞这套012---Man, if you tried that on my birthday...
那你准备看我发飙吧012---...you'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit.
加一小撮番红花 会起很大作用012---You add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
好012---Okay, uh...
- 摩妮卡 - 是012---- Monica? - Yes?

跟你说吧 我不介意投资 生产蕃茄干产业012---I tell you, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried-tomato business.
五年前要是有人跟我说 我们可以让蕃茄变枣干012---Five years ago, if somebody'd said to me, "Here's a tomato that looks like a prune"...
我会说 给我滚出去012---...I'd have said, "Get out of my office."
爸，我出生前 你有很紧张吗012---Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
我没紧张 我只是说…012---I'm not freaking out. I'm just saying...
要是有人来跟我说012---...if someone had come to me with the idea...
爸，我是在说 生小孩的事012---Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm talking about the whole, uh, baby thing.
你有过那种012---Did you, uh, ever get this sort of...
为人父恐慌症吗012---...panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
没012---No.
你妈很尽责 我全心冲事业012---Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business.
我不常在家012---I wasn't around that much.
你讲半天是要讲这个吗012---Is that what this is about?

很抱歉那不是那种…012---I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies...
有枪有炮…012---...with, like, you know, like, guns and bombs...
或是巴士开超快的电影012---...and, like, buses going really fast.
喂，我喜欢的电影 不一定要有暴力…012---Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie...
只要有一些裸露镜头就够了012---...just so long as there's a little nudity.
- 有裸露镜头啊 - 我是说女性的裸露镜头012---- There was nudity. - I meant female nudity.
好，我不想看路葛兰有前戏012---All right, I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.

我们要去洗澡 对不对  对啊 我们要洗澡哦 好不好012---Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. Yes, we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
他们仍然只是朋友吧012---They're still just friends, right?
我们明天见012---And I will see you tomorrow.
没错 明天你要来 瑞秋阿姨这边 对不对012---That's right. You're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you?
等一下，等一下 摩妮卡阿姨有没有权利说话？012---Hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

拜托，放轻松 明天你根本就不在012---Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be here.
真不敢相信我们居然在讨论这种事012---CHANDLER: I can't believe we're having this discussion.
同意，我也不敢相信012---I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
你不觉得你跟瑞秋如果能在一起 早就在一起了012---Don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened?
我告诉你们 她说她想要跟…012---I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship...
像我这样的人谈恋爱012---...with someone exactly like me.
她真的这么说012---She really said that?
〝像我这样的人〞是我自己加的012---Well, I added the "exactly like me" part.
但是她说她在找个好男人 好男人今晚就会出现了012---But she said she's looking for someone. And someone is gonna be there tonight.
〝今晚〞 你是说真的012---"Tonight" tonight?
我想这一定会很完美 就只有我们两个012---Well, I think it's perfect. It's just gonna be the two of us.
她整天都在照顾我的猴子012---She spent all day taking care of my monkey.
我不记得上次有女生 照顾我的猴子是什么时候的事了012---I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
反正，下班后 我去买一瓶酒…012---Anyway, you know, I figured after work, I'd go pick up a bottle of wine...
然后过去开始追求她012---...go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
你知道你应该怎么做吗012---Hey, you know what you should do?
你应该带她回19世纪末 当时还有人使用那种字眼012---You should take her back to the 1890s when that phrase was last used.
如果你坚持下去…012---If you keep this up...
不到周末，那个浑蛋就玩完了012---...you'll be finished with this sucker by the end of the week.
那个围着羽绒围巾的是 法兰西斯医生012---Now, the one in the feathered boa, that's Dr. Francis.
她以前是个男人012---Now, she used to be a man.
你看，那是瑞文 我们讨厌她012---Oh, look. See, now, there's Raven. We hate her.
很高兴她快死了012---We're glad she's dying.
然后…怎么了 马塞尔012---And then... What? Marcel.
你在玩摩妮卡阿姨的鞋子吗？ 你知道你不可以…012---Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to...
哇，哇012---Whoa, whoa.
马塞尔 你大便在鞋子里012---Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?
马塞尔，坏猴子 噢012---Oh, Marcel. Bad monkey.

谁死了  谁死了012---Who died? Who died?
把他翻过来 快点，把他翻过来012---Roll him over. Oh, come on, roll him over. Oh!
我们知道那不是德柯斯特 对不对，马塞尔？因为…012---Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right, Marcel? Because...
马塞尔 马塞尔 马…012---Marcel? Marcel? Marc...?
- 你怎么可能把他弄丢了？ - 不知道，我也不知道012---- How could you lose him? - I don't know, I don't know.
我们在看电视 然后他大便在摩妮卡的鞋子里…012---We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe...
等等 他大便在我的鞋子里  哪一只012---Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
不知道，左脚那一只012---I don't know. The left one.
哪一双012---Which ones?
就是那双你认为百搭的笨重黑鞋012---Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
- 嘿 - 嘿012---- Hey. GROUP: Hey.
为什么空气中充满了负面情绪012---Whoa, oh. Why is the air in here so negative?
- 瑞秋把马塞尔弄丢了 - 噢，不会吧，怎么弄的012---- Rachel lost Marcel. - Oh, no. How?
- 他大便在我的鞋子里  - 那一只012---- He pooped in my shoe. - Which one?
就是我常穿的那双可爱黑鞋012---Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
不是，是哪一只012---No, which one? Ha, ha.
右脚还是左脚？012---The right or left?
因为左脚的话，代表幸运012---Because the left one is lucky.
大伙儿，拜托 我该怎么办？012---Come on, you guys. What am I gonna do?
好吧，好吧 你是一只猴子…012---All right, all right, all right. You're a monkey...

你会去哪里？012---Where do you go?
好，这是他第一次出门…012---Okay, it's his first time out...
所以他可能会去 一些观光景点012---...so he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things.
我去《猫》音乐剧那边找 你们去俄国茶坊找012---I'll go to Cats. You go to the Russian Tea Room.

哇，那我怎么办？012---Whoa, whoa. What am I gonna do?
好，你留在这里等电话012---Okay, you stay here and just wait by the phone.
在我的鞋子里喷清洁剂 等罗斯回来杀你012---Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you.

我把格子松饼放在外头 是不是你们拿走的012---I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it?
不是012---No.
你为什么要把格子松饼 放在走道里？012---Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
我还没准备好要吃012---I wasn't ready for it.
猴子，你有没有看到猴子012---The monkey, have you seen a monkey?
我见过主持人瑞吉斯一次012---I saw Regis Philbin once.

我突然想疯一下 你要不要去纽华克012---I'm feeling kind of crazy. Do you want to go to Newark?
好，好啊012---Uh, okay. Yeah.
我们当然可以去那里 但在去东北部的谋杀案首都前…012---We could do that. But before we head off to the murder capital of the Northeast...
我想先跟你谈一件事012---...I was, uh, kind of wanted to run something by you.
你知道我们先前谈过的…012---You know how we were, you know, talking before...
有关恋爱之类的话题…012---...about relationships and stuff, well...
- 噢，天啊，罗斯，我不能这么做 - 好吧，迅速而痛苦012---- Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this. - Okay, quick and painful.

你知道，马塞尔吧012---You know Marcel?
- 怎么  - 嗯012---- Yeah? - Well, ahem.
我好像把他弄丢了012---I kind of, uh... I kind of lost him.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
我只是要你看着他 别让他离开这间公寓012---I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
我知道，我知道，对不起012---I know, I know. I'm sorry.
你知道吗 我想我也有错012---You know what? I guess it's partially my fault.
我不应该一开始就请你照顾猴子012---I shouldn't have asked you to start off with a monkey.
应该一开始就请你看着 一支铅笔之类的012---I should have started you off with, like, a pen or a pencil.
罗斯，我已经在尽力找了012---Ross, I'm doing everything that I can.
大家都在找他，而且我还…012---I've got everybody looking for him and I got...
- 哪一位  - 动物紧急救援小组012---- Who is it? LUISA [OVER INTERCOM]: Animal Control.
- 你看，我还打电话给动物紧急救援 - 你打电话给动物紧急救援012---- See, I've even got Animal Control. - You called Animal Control?
嗯哼012---Uh-huh.
怎么了 你不喜欢他们吗012---Why? Do you not like them?
马塞尔是非法引进的外来动物012---Heh. Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
我不能在城市里养012---I'm not allowed to have him in the city.
他们一旦找到他 就会把他从我身边带走012---If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
好吧，这样说好了 你从来没有告诉过我们这件事012---Okay, well, now, see, you never ever, ever told us that.
没错，因为我没想到 你会邀请他们来这里012---That's right, because I didn't expect you we're gonna invite them to the apartment.
你好，谢谢你赶过来012---Hi. Thanks for coming.
是不是有人打电话 问猴子怎么处理012---Somebody called about a monkey?
噢，你知道吗 那完全是个误会012---Oh. Oh, you know what? That was a complete misunderstanding.
对啊，我们以为 我们看到一只猴子，结果不是012---Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.
- 那是顶帽子 - 猫012---- It turned out it was a hat. - Cat.
猫，我刚刚说什么012---Cat. What did I say?
3楼跟4楼 我们都去看过了012---Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor.
- 没有人看到马塞尔 - 马塞尔012---- No one's seen Marcel. - Marcel?
我叔叔马塞尔012---My uncle Marcel.
噢，猴子的名字就是这样来的012---Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
好吧012---Okay.
你们知道私自豢养 非法引进的外来动物…012---Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is punishable...
最高可罚到2年牢狱 动物没收012---...by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal.
噢，天啊012---PHOEBE: Oh, my God.
你们会把可怜的小动物 关在牢里2年？012---You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
菲比，记不记得我们说过 说话前要先想一下？012---Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
记得，不过不是随时 都有时间可以这样做012---Yes, but there isn't always time.
我相信一定有更友善的方式解决 你先请坐012---Look, I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Um, have a seat.
我们还没自我介绍 我是摩妮卡·盖勒012---First of all, we haven't been introduced. I'm Monica Geller.
噢，天啊，是你012---Oh, my God, you are.
- 而你是瑞秋·葛林 - 对012---- And you're Rachel Green. - Yeah.
露伊莎·基雅内蒂 我也是林肯高中毕业的012---Luisa Gianetti. Lincoln High?
每次在教室上课时 我都坐在你们后面012---I sat behind you guys in homeroom.
露伊莎，噢，我的天啊012---Oh! Luisa. Oh, my God.
摩妮卡，是露伊莎耶！012---Monica. It's Luisa!
同间教室的露伊莎012---Luisa. From homeroom.
太好了！012---Yes!
- 你根本不知道我是谁，对不对  - 不知道012---- You have no idea who I am, do you? RACHEL: No.
完全不知道012---Not at all.
也许是因为整整4年  你正眼都没瞧过我012---Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.
说句〝早安，露伊莎〞，还是…012---Would it have been so hard to say, "Morning, Luisa"...
〝好可爱的吊带裤〞 有那么难吗012---...or "Nice overalls"?
噢，真对不起012---Oh, I'm so sorry.
我不怪你，你那时候很胖 问题已经够多了012---It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems.
但是你，真是个讨人厌的女生012---But you. What a bitch.
什么？012---What?
这样好了，过去就算了012---You know what? Be that as it may.
看在过去的份上，猴子的事 能不能请你帮个忙012---You think you could you help us out here on that monkey thing, for old times' sake?
加油，山猫队012---Go, Bobcats.
我可以，但是我不帮012---I could. But I won't.
猴子被我找到，就是我的了012---If I find that monkey, he's mine.
哒 哒 哒012---Da, da, da
很遗憾012---Sorry.
马塞尔？012---CHANDLER: Marcel?
马塞尔？012---JOEY: Marcel?
- 马塞尔？ - 马塞尔？012---- Marcel? - Marcel?
嘿，有什么事我可以帮忙的吗？012---Hi, can I help you?
我们有点紧急状况 我们在找东西012---Uh, we're kind of having an emergency, and, ahem, we were looking for something.
- 找猴子 - 对，你有没有看到一只猴子？012---- A monkey. - Yes, have you seen any?
没有，我没看到什么猴子012---No. No, I haven't seen a monkey.
你们会不会修理暖气炉？012---Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
当然，你们有没有试着 把开关往相反方向转？012---Sure, sure. Did you try turning the knob back the other way?
- 当然有 - 那我们就没办法了012---- Of course. - Oh. Then, no.
你尝尝这鸡尾酒 莱姆酒会不会放太多？012---Taste this daiquiri. Is there too much rum in here?
等一下，希望你们快点找到猴子012---Just a second. Hope you find your monkey.
噢，不，等一下等一下012---Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. Wait, wait.
暖气炉我们可能不太熟悉…012---Um, we may not know about radiators, per se...
但是我们对环境的冷暖…012---...but we do have a certain amount of expertise...
有一定程度的认知012---...in the heating and cooling milieu.
我们不是还有事情要做吗？012---Uh, weren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
对，但是这些女人很热 而且需要我们帮忙012---Yes, but these women are very hot and they need our help.
而且还很辣012---And they're very hot.
我们不可以这样，好吗？012---We can't, all right?
很遗憾012---We're sorry.
你们不知道我们有多遗憾 但是我们已经答应要去找猴子012---You have no idea how sorry. But we promised we'd find this monkey.
如果你们看到他，他大概这么高 叫他马塞尔他会回应012---If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel.
如果我们能够有你们的照片 那对我们帮助很大012---So if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
好吧，从现在开始 你不准跟外人说话012---Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.

- 罗斯，你怎么知道？ - 噢，拜托，现在又冷又暗012---- Ross, you don't know that. - Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark.

你身边的倒楣事都会自动发生012---I mean, things just sort of happen around you.
你一直都活在自己的世界里 做你自己的事…012---I mean, you're off in Rachel Land, doing your Rachel thing...
完全不顾别人的猴子 还是别人的感受…012---...totally oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and...
- 连我都不想听 - 罗斯012---- I don't even want to hear it. - Ross.
- 算了，可以吗？ - 罗斯012---- Forget it, okay? - Ross.

噢，真是有够强的012---Oh, this is so intense.
我一边的屁股完全麻掉 另一边却完全不知道012---One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.
嘿，香蕉是你买的吗？012---Hi. Did you order some bananas?
- 那又怎样？ - 猴子还我012---- What about it? - Give me my monkey back.

她为什么不回电？012---Why isn't she calling me back?

你也可以打她的答录机 如果“哔”很多声的话…012---You know, you could call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps...
表示她还没听留官012---...that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.

你一定看过我的征友启示012---Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.

那时候我们先前讨论过的〝喂〞 就很好用012---You see, this is where you'd use that "hello" word we talked about.
我才不要 她已经听过我的留言…012---I'm not going to. She obviously got my message...
选择不回我电话 现在我不但黏人 还被冷落012---...and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed.

真的吗012---Really?
敏蒂，如果这样讲 你会好过一点…012---Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better...

我从查号台拿到正确号码后 却没人接012---And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer.
我就想来这里 看看你好不好012---So I thought I'd just come down here and make sure you were okay.
噢，我很好012---Oh, uh, I'm okay.

我不确定012---I don't know.
你不确定012---RACHEL: You don't know?
她看起来很讨人喜欢 但是大老远跑来这里…012---Oh, she seems nice, but that thing about her coming all the way here...
只为了看我好不好 有人那么黏人的吗012---...just to see if I was okay? I mean, how needy is that?
怎么会有人知道 你的信用卡号码012---How'd someone get your credit card number?
我也不知道 看看他们花了多少钱012---I have no idea. Look how much they spent!
摩妮卡，冷静点，信用卡公司说 你只要付你有买东西的钱012---Calm down. You only have to pay for the stuff you bought.
但这真的是挥霍无度012---Still, it's just such reckless spending.
我想他们偷你的信用卡时…012---When somebody steals your credit card...
早就将王法抛诸脑后了012---...they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
哇，真是怪人 花了美金69点95元买神奇拖把012---Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
是我买的012---That's me.
噢，嗯心012---Oh! Oh, the yuck.
他又来了012---He's doing it again!
马塞尔，别再侵犯那盏灯了012---Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

过来这里，．马塞尔012---Come here, Marcel!
不要！别去我房间！ 我去抓他012---Oh, no, no! Not in my room! I'll get him.
罗斯，你得想想办法012---You've got to do something about the humping.
干嘛？只是阶段性而已012---What? It's just a phase.
我们也是那样说乔伊的012---Well, that's what we said about Joey.
放轻松点好吗  没什么大不了的012---Hey, would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
马塞尔，给我停止！ 马塞尔！你这个坏猴子012---RACHEL: Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
怎么了012---- What? RACHEL: Ugh!
就说我的好奇娃娃 已经不再好奇了吧012---Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.

- 这个女人过着我的生活 - 什么012---- This woman's living my life. - What?
她在过我的生活 而且过得比我好012---She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me.
你看看这个，看012---Look at this. Look.
她买票去看我想看的戏012---She buys tickets to plays I want to see.
她买的衣服 是我早就想买的012---She shops at stores that I'm intimidated by the salespeople.
她花三百美金在美术用品上012---She spent $300 on art supplies.
你又不是艺术家012---You're not an artist.
如果我有那些东西 或许就可以了012---Yeah, well, I might be if I had the supplies.
这些我都可以做啊 只是我都没做012---I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
摩妮卡，别这样 你也做很多很棒的事情啊012---Oh, Monica, come on. You do cool things.
是吗  来比较一下吧012---Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we?
现在做比较 会不会太晚了012---Oh, it's so late for "shall we?"
我会去公园骑马吗012---Do I go horseback riding in the park, hmm?
我会在新学院大学上课吗012---Do I take classes at The New School?

她有所有我要的东西 而且不用应付我妈012---She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
乔伊·帕帕尼如何012---How about Joey Paponi?
不行，太有种族意味了 我的经纪人觉得要取中立一点的名字012---No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
乔伊·瑞士012---Joey Switzerland?
而且我觉得叫乔就好  乔伊听起来好像我只有…012---Plus I think it should be Joe. Joey makes me sound like I'm...
这么大而已012---...this big.
但我并不是012---Which I'm not!
乔、乔、乔… 史达林012---Joe, Joe, Joe... Stalin?
史达林012---Stalin.
我听过那个名字吗  好耳熟012---Do I know that name? That sounds familiar.
我没印象012---- Well, it does not ring a bell with me. - Huh.
乔·史达林012---Joe Stalin.
还挺不错的012---You know, that's pretty good.
还可以试试乔瑟夫012---You might want to try Joseph. - Ah!
乔瑟夫·史达林！012---Joseph Stalin!
- 大家一定会记得！ - 当然啦！012---- I think you'd remember that! - Oh, yes!

你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
好，太好了012---All right, great.
好，谢谢了012---Great. Thanks a lot.
我要去上踢踏舞课了012---I'm going to tap class.
好让你跟偷了你信用卡的女人 一起跳舞吗012---So you can dance with the woman that stole your card?
她偷了我的人生 我想知道她是谁012---She's got my life. I want to see who she is.
那就去邮局啊！ 我相信里面有张贴她的照片012---Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up!
亲爱的，你快失控了012---Honey, you're kind of losing it here.
这已经变成怪异的执迷012---This is really becoming a weird obsession.
这太疯狂了  我告诉你012---This is madness, I tell you.
上帝保佑，摩妮卡 别这么做012---For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!
谢谢012---Thank you.
你们怎么想012---What do you think?

你觉得她是哪一个012---Which one do you think she is?
- 有我可以效劳的地方吗  - 不用了，谢谢012---- May I help you? - Oh, no, thanks.
我们只是来参观的012---We're just here to observe.
舞蹈课不是用来参观的  要用跳的012---You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class!
那边有鞋子012---Spare shoes are over there.
什么意思012---What does she mean?
我想她是说 〝舞蹈课…012---I think she means, "You dance...
要用跳的！〞012---...a dance class!"
来吧…！012---Come on, come on, come on!
真的吗012---Really?
嘿，你有看到我的分身吗012---Hey, do you see anybody you think could be me?
各位，上次下课后 有人留下优格空瓶012---People, last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class.
不要再让这种事发生了！012---Let's not have that happen again!
她可以当你的分身012---She could be you.
开始吧012---Let's get started.
五、六 五、六、七、八012---Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.
好，我完全不会！012---Okay, I'm not getting this!
我超会的！012---I'm totally getting it!
你会觉得自己 超不协调的吗012---Do you ever just feel like you're so unbelievably uncoordinated?
干嘛 他们踢的时候 跟着踢就是了012---What? You just click when they click.
好吧，各位，找个舞伴012---All right. Now everyone grab a partner.
哦！哦012---Oh! Oh.
我死去的母亲说 就是你，我跟瑞秋是舞伴012---All right. And my dead mother said you are it! I'm with Rachel.
太好了，体育课的旧事又重演了012---Great, it's gym class all over again.
哦012---RACHEL & PHOEBE: Aww.
没关系，你可以来前面 跟我搭档012---That's all right. You can come up to the front and dance with me.
我还不如脱掉衣服 做个恶梦算了012---Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare?
没关系了 我来了  很抱歉我迟到了012---It's okay, it's okay! I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.
好，我到了012---Okay, here I am.
这位紧张的新人是谁012---So who's the new tense girl?
她是你的舞伴012---She's your partner.
- 嗨，我是摩妮卡 - 嗨012---- Hi, I'm Monica. - Hi.
哦，呵012---Oh, ha.
摩妮卡012---Monica.
嗨，我是摩…012---Hi, I'm Mon...
娜娜012---Nana.
- 摩娜娜  - 是的012---- Monana? - Yeah.
是荷兰语012---It's Dutch.
开玩笑吧  我在阿姆斯特丹住了三年012---You're kidding. I spent three years in Amsterdam.
我是宾州的荷兰人012---Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
要跳舞了！012---And we're dancing!
五、六、七、八012---Five, six, seven, eight.
嗨012---Hi.
- 嘿 - 嘿012---- Hey. - Hey.
- 你去哪了  - 我刚从兽医那里回来012---- Where have you been? - I just got back from the vet.
她不会叫你戴那些塑胶头套吧012---She's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone, is she?
她说马塞尔乱性不是暂时的012---She says Marcel's humping thing is not a phase.
显然他已经性成熟了012---Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.
嘿，他比你还快耶！012---Hey, he beat you!
她说他会愈来愈暴力 侵略性愈来愈强012---She says, as time goes on, he'll start getting aggressive and violent.
什么意思012---What does this mean?
我得放弃他012---I have to give him up.
我不敢相信，罗斯 这太扯了！012---I can't believe it. This sucks!
我不懂，你才刚养他 怎么可能已经成年了012---You just got him. How could he be an adult already?
我知道  前一天 才小小只的…012---I know, I know. One day he's this little thing...
不知不觉中 就变成…012---...and before you know it, he's this little thing...
紧抓我的腿不放的小东西012---...I can't get off my leg.
没有办法能让你留下他吗012---Isn't there any way you can keep him?
没有012---No. No.
兽医说除非有个地方…012---The vet said that unless he's in a place where he has regular access...
让他获得正常的猴爱012---...to some monkey loving...
否则他会愈来愈残暴012---...he's just gonna get vicious.
我得把他送到动物园012---I just gotta get him into a zoo.
- 要怎么把猴子送到动物园  - 我知道！012---- How do you get a monkey into a zoo? - I know that one!
不，那是教宗 进入福斯汽车012---No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.
我们申请了很多动物园 首要选择当然是州立动物园012---We're applying to a lot of them. Our first choice would be a state zoo.
像是圣地牙哥012---You know, like, uh, San Diego.
对吧012---Right?
但那可能是遥不可及的梦想  因为他来自州外012---But that may just be a pipe dream because he's out-of-state.
我的兽医在迈阿密有认识人 所以有可能去那里012---My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
但那里离海滩只有两条街  一定是轰趴动物园012---But that's two blocks from the beach. It's a total party zoo.
嘿012---- Hey. CHANDLER: Hey.
- 嗨 - 我们找到那个女生了！012---- Hi. - We found the girl!
- 什么  - 有打电话给警察吗012---- What? - Did you call the cops?
没有，我们请她吃午餐012---Nope. We took her to lunch.
你们自己的私自执法方式012---Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
你疯了吗  这个女人偷了你的东西！012---Are you insane? This woman stole from you!
她偷东西，是小偷耶012---She stole! She's a stealer!
跟她相处十分钟之后 你就会忘掉这些了012---After you're with this woman for 10 minutes, you forget all that.
她真的是个奇女子…012---I mean, she's this astounding person...
振奋人心！012---...with this amazing spirit!
是啊，可能是从啦啦队员 那里偷来的！012---Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader!
- 把帽子脱掉 - 福斯车里的教宗！012---- Take off their hats. - Popes in a Volkswagen!
嗯哼012---Mm-hm.
我超爱那个笑话012---I love that joke.
- 不可能！你不可能这么做！ - 摩娜娜很勇敢012---- No way! No way did you do this! - Monana was very brave.
超狂野的012---It was so wild.
我们跟他们说我们是 615号房的刚氏姐妹…012---We told them we were the Gunnersons in room 615...
才知道波士顿的《塞尔蒂克队》 包下整个六楼！012---...only to find out the Boston Celtics had the entire sixth floor!
当他们发现 我们很矮而且有胸部后012---So when they caught on to the fact that we're short and have breasts...
就把我们轰出去 我被饭店赶出去，我耶！012---They threw us out. I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
好样的，摩娜娜！012---Go, Monana!
不是只有你们活在梦想中012---Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream.
我得去为我不认识的人 倒咖啡了，不用等我了012---I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
噢，还有一件事…012---Oh, by the way...
我们明天要去参加 百老汇的试镜012---...tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
什么012---Excuse me?
《猫》剧有一个缺额012---There's an open call for Cats.
我想说我们可以去 演唱《回忆》…012---I'm thinking we go down there, sing "Memories"...
把自己当成傻子 你觉得如何？012---...and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say?
不、不、不012---No, no, no.
要记得我是什么样的人012---Remember who you're dealing with here. Ha.
我不像你，我连站在 踢踏舞教室前面都有困难012---I'm not like you. I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
那大概是因为你有孟诺教派的背景012---That's because of your Amish background.
- 什么  - 你是宾州的荷兰人 对吧012---- What? - Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
对012---Right.
直到我买了吹风机 就被逐出村里012---Till I bought a blow dryer. Then I was shunned.
我以前就跟你一样012---I was just like you.
然后有一天，我看了一部 改变我一生的电影012---And then one day, I saw a movie that changed my life.
你有看过《春风化雨》吗012---- Did you ever see Dead Poets Society? - Uh-huh.
我觉得那部电影超级…012---I thought that movie was so incredibly...
无聊的！012---...boring!
最后那个孩子自杀…012---I mean, that thing at the end where the kid...
只因为不能参与话剧演出012---...kills himself because he can't be in the play?
搞什么012---What was that?
拜托，等个一年 离家参与社区话团演出不就行了012---It's like, "Kid, wait a year. Leave home, do some community theater!"
我走出戏院后心想…012---I walked out of there, and I thought:
〝我浪费了永远拿不回来的 两小时生命〞012---"Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back!"
那个想法震撼了我 让我及时行乐012---And that scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
哇012---Wow.
那我绝对不推荐你看 《窈窕奶爸》012---Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
天啊012---Oh, God.
我们进不了斯克兰顿012---We didn't get into Scranton.
那是我们的保障动物园012---That was our safety zoo.
他们连狗和牛都收012---They take, like, dogs and cows.
看吧012---See?
我不懂是我还是他 比较难受012---I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
我想是那张椅子最难受012---I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.
马塞尔，马塞尔012---ROSS: Marcel. Marcel.
马塞尔，不要弄了012---Marcel, no.
好孩子！012---Good boy!
看到了吗  怎么可能没人要他012---See? How can nobody want him?
会有人要的012---Somebody will.
你们知道 已经有位乔瑟夫史达林了吗012---You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
你在开玩笑吧！012---You're kidding!
显然他是个俄国独裁者 屠杀过很多人012---Apparently, he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people!
- 你会想说这种事情应该要知道的！ - 你会想说我该知道的012---- You'd think you would've known that! - You'd think I would've.
菲比  你觉得什么艺名 适合我012---Phoebe, what do you think a good stage name for me would be?
火焰男孩012---Flame Boy!
你的动物园在哪里012---Where exactly is your zoo?
严格来说，它不能算是动物园012---Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.
它比较像是互动的野生体验012---It's, uh, more of an interactive wildlife experience.
让我问问你几个问题 他叫做马塞尔对吧？012---Let me ask you some questions about... Is it, uh, Marcel?
对对012---- Yes. - Yes. Uh...
他会和其他动物打架吗012---Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
不会，他非常温驯012---No, no. He's very docile.
即使被逼到角落去也一样吗012---Hmm. Even if he were cornered?
嗯，我不太清楚 为什么问？012---Well, I don't know. Why?
他掌控小东西的能力为何012---Um, how is he at handling small objects?
他可以握住香蕉 如果你是这个意思的话012---He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.
铁槌或小刀呢012---What about a hammer or a small blade?
他为什么会需要小刀012---Why would he need a blade?
如果他得面对猎豹 或有角的动物…012---If he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns...
总得给他点东西 自我防卫吧012---...you got to give the little guy something.
不然就太残忍了！012---Otherwise, it's just cruel!
他能去圣地牙哥了！012---He got into San Diego!
- 什么  - 对012---- What? - Yeah.
我们散步回来后 电话响起012---We were coming back from our walk, and the phone was ringing...
- 他进了  - 他进了012---- He's in! - He's in? Ah!
你有听到吗  马塞尔012---Did you hear that, Marcel?
是圣地牙哥耶  太棒了012---San Diego! San Diego! Yeah!
你真的犯下大错 圣地牙哥的环境是很不错…012---You're making a mistake. San Diego's well and good...
但如果你把他交给我 我会训练他对抗瞎眼的兔子…012---...but if you give him to me, I'll start him against a blind rabbit...
还给你百分之二十的门票收入012---...and give you 20 percent of the gate.

你却担心 谁要带你去看大苹果马戏团012---...and you're worried about who will take you to the Big Apple Circus?

没什么好纳闷的012---There's nothing to wonder about.
你就回去过以前的生活 因为那才是真正的你012---You'll go back to being who you were because that's who you are.

我一直很疑惑 〝为什么大家还是继续去那里〞012---And I just kept thinking, "Why do people continue to go there?"
哦，啊012---Oh, ah.
- 我得走了 - 好吧012---- I should go. - Okay.
好012---Okay.
- 除非… - 什么012---- Unless... - What?
你想在这里过夜012---Uh, unless you wanna stay over.
我得在这里过夜，所以…012---I mean, I'm going to. So...
好啊，我很愿意012---Yeah, I'd really like that.
在真正开始过夜之前…012---Uh, before we get into any staying-over stuff...
有些事要先让你知道012---...there's something you should know.
好，是类似 〝我明天早上有一堂很早的课〞的事…012---Okay. Is this like "I have an early class tomorrow"...
还是〝我已经跟一头山羊秘婚了〞？012---...or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?
介于两者之间012---Well, it's somewhere in between.
严格来说，我不算是…012---You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not, uh...
我是说，我从来没有…012---Well, I mean, I haven't ever, um...
- 伊森  - 什么事012---- Ethan? - Yeah?
你是处男吗012---Are you a virgin?
如果这是你们这些孩子 现代的说法…012---Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days...
那，对，我算是012---...then yes, I am.
我一直在等待对的人出现012---I, uh... I've kind of been waiting for the right person.
- 真的吗  - 真的012---- Really? - Yeah.
你知道我是指你吧012---You do know I was talking about you, right?
哇012---Wow.
你一直哇哇哇012---You keep saying that.
这在书上看过 电影上也有012---You know, you read about it. You see it in the movies.
就算在家里自己练习过 但是，天啊…012---Even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man...
感觉完全不同012---...it is nothing like that.
哦012---Oh.
等一下，听着012---Listen, listen.
你告诉一件 对你来说很难启齿的事012---Um, you told me something that was really difficult for you.
我想，既然你可以对我说实话 我也可以对你说实话012---And, um, well, I figure if you can be honest, then I can too.
- 天啊，不要告诉我我做错了 - 不是012---- Oh, God, don't tell me I did it wrong. - No.
不是，不是，不是012---- No, no, no. - Oh.
完全正确012---- Nothing wrong about that. - Oh. Ha, ha.
好，是这样的012---Um, okay. Here goes.
我不是22岁012---I'm not 22.
我25…012---I'm 25.
又13个月012---And 13 months.
呵012---Huh.
但是我想，这不应该有什么影响吧012---But I figure, you know, that shouldn't change anything.
我们的年龄 不是什么问题吧，对不对012---I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are?
嗯…012---Listen, um...
既然我们开始说实话了…012---...as long as we're telling stuff, uh...
我还有一件事要告诉你012---...I have another one for you.
我比当初说的要小一点012---I'm a little younger than I said.
你不是在念最后一年了吗012---You're not a senior?
我是最后一年…012---Oh, I'm a senior.
高中最后一年012---In high school.
好吧012---Okay.
我们做的事大错特错012---What we did was wrong.
天啊，刚刚跟我上床的人 美国两百周年国庆时还不存在012---Oh, God. I just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.
我刚破处012---I just had sex.
伊森，专心一点 你怎么不早点说012---Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
- 你也没告诉我你多大  - 那不一样012---- You never told me how old you were. - That's different.
我的谎话不会让我在48州 都成为通缉犯012---My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states.
- 你有没有在用大脑  - 我没在用大脑，我忙着…012---- What were you thinking? - I wasn't thinking. I was busy falling...
- 不要说出来 - 爱上你012---- Don't say it. ...in love with you.
真的吗012---Really?
对不起012---Sorry.
不要再爱我了012---Well, fall out of it.
你根本不该在这里 明天还要上学012---You know, you shouldn't even be here. It's a school night.
天啊，天啊012---Oh, God. Oh, God.
我和那些专找 乳臭未干的小子的女人没两样012---I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
我是琼考琳斯012---I'm Joan Collins.
谁啊012---Who?
好吧，安德烈45分钟后就会回来012---Okay, Andre should be there in about 45 minutes.
好的，再见012---Alrighty. Bye-bye.
这样比较干脆012---Ahem. It's just easier that way.
好啦，上次做的梦 你就肯说012---Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
不要，不告诉你012---No. Forget it.
为什么 我是不是做了 什么特别销魂蚀骨的事012---Well, why not? Was I doing something particularly saucy?
好啦，好啦012---All right, fine. Um...
当时不只有你012---Well, you were not the only one there.
乔伊也在012---Joey was there too.
好012---All right.
还有…012---Was there, uh, heh...
别人吗012---...anybody else there?
- 没有 - 你确定012---- No. - You sure?
没有人在发薄荷糖之类的吗012---Nobody, uh, handing out mints or anything?
没有，就我们三个012---No, it was just the three of us.
哦012---Oh.
那么，是你先跟钱德 然后再你和我…012---So tell me, was it like you and Chandler and then you and me...
还是你、我和钱德都在一起012---...or you and me and Chandler?
- 你知道吗  - 什么012---- You know what? - What?
有时候…012---There were times...

这个跟他连络簿上要有家长签名 才能不去上体育课有关吗012---And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym?
我没说… 我什么都没说，我发誓012---I didn't say any... I did not say anything, I swear.
他跑来看你012---He stopped by.

我不懂，这些人 - 个月前都还是我的朋友012---Know what? I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.
现在我换了位置 不表示我的脑袋也换了012---Just because I'm in charge, doesn't mean I'm a different person.

我们想要化石 可是他们不想给我们化石012---We want the bone, they don't want us to have it.

忘了她吧012---Forget about her.
他说得对，你要忘了她，快点去中国吧 去吃些好吃的中国菜012---He's right, man. Please move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
当然中国人不会说 自己吃的是〝中国菜〞012---Of course, there they just call it food.
大概吧，我不知道012---Yeah? I guess. I don't know.
好吧，那就帮我 把这个交给她，好吗？012---All right, just give her this for me, okay?
老兄，我们是为了你好012---Listen, we're just looking out for you.

我觉得你是个好人012---I just think you're nice.
我们是那时候开始 经营水果篮生意的012---Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this fruit-basket business.
我们称自己为 〝篮子三剑客〞012---We call ourselves "The Three Basketeers." Ha, ha.

那本书伴我度过 许多艰困的日子012---That book got me through some tough times.

我跟他说这枚胸针 跟我小时候奶奶的胸针很像012---I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was little.
真不敢相信 他竟然还记得012---Aw! I can't believe he remembered!
可是你能在飞机上玩那个吗012---Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
好美喔！012---Oh, it's so pretty.
- 定花了他很多钱 - 真是不敢相信012---- This must've cost him a fortune. - I can't believe he did this.
你们记得上大学时 罗斯爱上卡萝…012---Ross? Remember when he fell in love with Carol...

你刚说什么012---What did you just say?
水晶鸭012---Crystal duck.
不是 不是012---No, no, no.
爱上卡萝的那段012---The, um... The "love" part?

我们的生活从此面临巨大转变012---Uh-uh. I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.
想办法让这女人闭嘴好吗012---Is there a mute button on this woman?
我觉得这样很棒 你跟罗斯在一起很棒！012---I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross!
- 你之前知道吗  - 不知道012---- Did you have any idea? - No, none.
我到纽约的第一个晚上 他说过要约我出去…012---My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out...
可是一直都没有发生 所以我以为…012---...but nothing ever happened, so I just...
他还说了什么 他有说想跟我约会吗012---What else did he say? Does he want to go out with me?
他既然那么爱你…012---Given that he's desperately in love with you...
应该不介意跟你喝杯咖啡吧012---...he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
罗斯012---Ross?
他一直都喜欢我012---All this time?
- 我得去找他谈谈  - 他人在中国（亦指瓷器）啊012---- I've gotta talk to him. - He's in China!

瑞秋，你要对他说什么012---What are you gonna say to him?
我不知道012---I don't know.
那你就不该去012---Maybe you shouldn't go.
对 如果你是去伤他的心 那就不用急于一时012---Right, because if you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.
对 但如果是好消息 那就马上去告诉他012---Yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.
搞不好等我看到他就会知道012---Maybe I'll know when I see him.
好吧，这样有帮助吗012---Here, look. All right, does this help?
没有012---No.
我只知道我等不了一个礼拜 这件事太让人震撼了012---All I know is, I cannot wait a week. This is just too big.

抱歉 没有登机证就无法进去012---Sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.

抱歉，这是联邦法律规定！012---I'm sorry. Federal regulations!
好，那你可以帮我传话吗012---All right, um, then could you please just give him a message for me?

好吧，你想说什么？012---All right. What's the message?
我不知道012---Uh... I don't know.
不好意思，先生、先生012---Excuse me! Sir! Excuse me! Sir?

瑞秋说她很喜欢你送的礼物 她会等你回来012---It's from Rachel. She loved the present. She'll see you when you get back.
什么012---What?
托碧 我不知道她在说什么012---Toby, I don't know what she's talking about.

不要跟我冷战012---Don't give me that deep freeze!
噢，乔伊、乔伊、乔伊！012---Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
我想我刚失去了知觉012---I think I blacked out there for a minute.
这不算什么啦012---It was nothing.
现在换你享受罗012---Well, now we gotta find something fun for you!
等等012---Ahh, you know what?
别管我了 你再来一次吧012---Forget about me. Let's, uh... Let's give you another turn.
我再一次012---Me, again?
有何不可012---Sure. Why not?
哇，有人明天 会拿到一个超大的水果篮！012---Boy! Somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!
我得说，乔伊 你跟我想像中的完全不一样012---I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you would be.
什么意思？012---How do you mean?
我以为你是 凡事只想到自己的男人012---I just had you pegged as one of those guys who are always, "Me, me, me!"
- 哈哈 - 可是你012---- Ha, ha. - But you...
竟然这么替别人着想012---...you're a giver.
你是我碰过最大方体贴的男人012---You're, like, the most generous man I ever met.
你根本就是个女人012---I mean, you're practically a woman.
瑞秋 你要把包装纸留起来吗012---So, uh, Rach, do you want to save this wrapping paper?
只有点破012---It's only a little torn.
你想跟罗斯在一起吗 还是我该把这东西给丢了012---Are you gonna go for it with Ross, or should I throw it out?
我不知道、我不知道012---I don't know.
我去的时候一直在想…012---Thought about it all of the way there...
回来的时候也一直想…012---...and I thought about it all the way back and, uh...
竟然是罗斯012---You know, it's Ross!
你们知道我的意思吗 我跟罗斯耶012---You know what I mean? It's Ross.
- 是啊！ - 是啊012---- Sure! - Sure.
我不知道 我的直觉告诉我…012---I don't know. This is just my initial gut feeling...
我想012---...but I'm thinking...
这样应该会很棒012---...it'd be really great.
天啊，我也这样觉得耶！ 我们会变成朋友兼亲家！012---Oh, my God, me too! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!
最棒的是 你对他已经很了解012---The best part is you already know everything about him.
感觉就像第十五次约会012---It's like starting on the 15th date.
对啊，一开始就像 已经约会十五次了一样012---But it would be like starting on the 15th date.
说的好012---Another good point.
我的意思是…012---No, I mean...
通常约会到第十五次 双方就应该已经在交往012---At the 15th date, you're already in a "relationship-y" place.
确定要在一起了012---You're committed.
呵012---Huh.
如果事情不成怎么办？012---What happens if it doesn't work out?
- 为什么会不成？ - 不知道，有时候就是会这样012---- Why isn't it working out? - I don't know, sometimes it doesn't.
他不够帅吗？ 还是赚的钱不够多？012---Is he not cute enough for you? Does he not make enough money?
- 不是啦，我只是… - 也许她有别的对象012---- No, I'm just... - Maybe there's someone else.
是吗？你还有别的对象吗？012---Is there? Is there someone else?
- 没有啊，没有别人 - 那你干嘛012---- No, there is no one else. - Then why the hell...
甩掉我哥？  - 什么？012---...are you dumping my brother?  - Wha...?
- 嘿，大… - 嘘！012---- Hey, big... - Shh!
慈善家012---Spender.
她还在睡觉012---She's still asleep.
- 结果怎样？ - 太神奇了012---- So how'd it go? - It was amazing.
你知道那种自认很行的感觉吗？012---You know how you think you're great in bed?
你会问我那种问题 就代表你根本不了解我012---The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.
昨晚我没办法表现012---Well, it's like, last night I couldn't do the thing...
拿手的技巧012---...that usually makes me great.
所以我只好想别的办法012---So I had to do all this other stuff.
结果我得到的回应超赞的！ 老兄，不是我想自夸！012---And the response I got! Man, oh, man.
好像去参加碎纸花游行一样开心012---It was like a ticker-tape parade!
我知道，我房间 离游行路线非常非常近012---Yes I know. As it happens, my room is very close to the parade route.
那种感觉真的很棒，不只是她 我也觉得超赞的012---It was amazing, and not just for her. Uh-uh. For me too.
那种感觉就像是 我突然间看不见了…012---It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind...
可是其他的感官却都变敏锐012---...but all my other senses are heightened.
我好像可以体会到…012---You know? It's like, I was able to appreciate it...
另一种层次的喜悦012---...on another level.
我不知道你还有层次可言012---I didn't know you had another level.
对啊，我之前也不知道！012---I know. Neither did I!
哇，这件裙子真漂亮 是你的生日礼物吗？012---- Hey, great skirts! Birthday present? - Yeah.
- 谁送的？ - 你送的012---- From who? - From you.
我把你送的衬衫拿去换了012---I exchanged the blouse you got me.
心意最重要012---Well, it's the thought.
罗斯的班机不是快到了吗？012---Doesn't Ross' flight get in in a couple hours?
我记得是在登机门二十七B012---At gate 27B?
对012---Uh, yeah.
摩妮卡，我想了很久012---Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it.
我觉得我不该跟罗斯在一起012---I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.
- 为什么？ - 因为我会觉得012---- Why? - Because I feel...
我不只是在跟他交往012---...like I wouldn't just be going out with him.
你们大家都会变成我约会的对象012---I would be going out with all of you.
- 我会有压力… - 没有压力、没有压力的！012---- Ugh, there'd be all this pressure and... - No pressure, no pressure!
摩妮卡，我们八字都还没一撇 你就已经这么…012---Nothing has even happened yet and you're already so...
我哪有！好吧012---I'm not "so."
一开始我是觉得有点怪…012---I was a teensy bit weird at first...
可是我发誓不会给你们压力012---...but I'll be good. I promise.
是谁？012---Who is it?
是我，卡尔012---CARL: It's me, Carl.
上来吧012---Come on up.
你背着我哥偷吃？012---Behind my brother's back?
像这种话 我绝不可能会对你说的012---Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
- 七百块！ - 太棒了！你办到了！012---- Seven hundred bucks. - All right, you did it.
家里有水果吗？012---Do we have any fruit?
真是可怕的两个礼拜012---Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?
你知道吗？ 我觉得我从中学到很多012---You know what, though? I really feel I learned something.
你还要继续 〝凡事以她为主〞吗？012---So you'll stick with this "it's all for her" thing?
你疯了吗？012---What, are you crazy?
- 个盲人恢复视觉之后 还会这样走路吗？012---When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
我只是说 如果再让我看到…012---I'm just saying, if I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr...
艾德贝格利在电动车里的照片012---...in that stupid electric car...
我就会自杀！012---...I'm gonna shoot myself!
我并不是反对环保…012---Don't get me wrong. I'm not against environmental issues, per se...
我只是讨厌那个家伙！012---...it's just that guy!
没想到你竟然宁愿跟他出去 而不是我012---I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
抱歉，我正在约会耶012---Excuse me, please. I'm trying to have a date here.
好，那就停止想我啊012---Fine, just stop thinking about me.
做不到是吧？012---Can't do it, can you?
我是在想你，那又怎样？012---So I'm thinking about you. So what?
我不懂 这个男人到底哪里好？012---I don't get it. What do you see in this guy anyway?
他似乎是一个好人012---Well, he seems to be a very nice guy.
拜托！你好歹也买部真正的车吧！012---I mean, come on, buddy! Get a real car!
瑞秋，给我们一个机会吧012---Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
- 罗斯，这对我来说太难了 - 不…012---- Ross, it's too hard. - No, no.
为什么？因为大家会觉得很怪吗？012---Because it'll get weird for everyone else?
谁会在乎啊？这是我们两人的事012---Who cares about them? This is about us.
