这个女的很棒012---Wow. This girl's good.
是啊  有押韵的歌词  连我都没想过012---Oh, yeah, a song with rhyming words. Ooh, I never thought of that before.
我喜欢她012---I like her.
为什么  因为她会唱歌  会弹吉他012---Why? Because she can sing and play guitar...
然后将两个结合在一起012---...and do both at the same time?
我对这些人的期望  也大概就这么多012---Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.

我在卖大鱼的地方  撞见弗拉德…012---I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish...
他说你常在这里表演012---...and he said you played here a lot, so...
听好  我得去厕所012---All right. I have to go to the bathroom.
如果她们又提到大鱼那个地方…012---But if the place with the big fish comes up again...
我想知道是有好几条大鱼  还是只有一条大鱼012---...I'd like to know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
菲比说你会写广告歌012---So Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
我其实是说她抛弃我  跑去写广告歌012---Actually, I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
有没有我们听过的012---Uh, anything we might've heard of?
有012---Uh, yeah, um...
对  但是我不写了  我很厌倦012---Yeah, but I don't do that anymore. I got kind of sick of it.
也想不出好歌曲   所以被炒了鱿鱼012---And then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
真惨012---Hmm, bummer.
其实我…012---Well, you know, I was just...
我在想说… 希望可以…012---Um, I was just thinking and just hoping that...
或许你想跟我再次搭档012---...maybe you'd want to get back together?
不要  不过谢谢你的提议012---No, but thanks.
别这样  菲比  你可不可以考虑一下012---Oh, come on, Phoebe. Would you just think about it?
好012---Okay.
不要  谢谢了012---No, but thanks.
好012---Okay, uh...
再见了  菲比012---See you, Pheebs.
真是残忍012---Wow. That was kind of brutal.

可以给我一张卫生纸吗012---Can I have a tissue, please?
好012---Oh, yes.

不在  他在咖啡厅  认识了一个女生012---No, um, he met some girl at the coffeehouse.
好像叫做琴吉012---Ooh. Yeah. Ginger something.
不…012---No.
不会吧  你确定不是  听起来像琴吉012---No, no. Uh, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded liked Ginger?
像是 "琴吉尔"012---Like, uh, "Gingeer"?
不  是琴吉012---No, it was Ginger.
我会记得是因为  他告诉我时  我说…012---I remember because when he told me, I said:
该死012---Oh, man.
我之前就是在躲那个女孩012---That's the girl I was hiding from.
她如果知道他是我室友  一定会跟他说我做了什么012---When she finds out he's my roommate, she'll tell him what I did.

等钱德回来再说  那样比较好玩012---We'll wait till Chandler gets home because it'll be more fun.
好吧012---All right.
大概是四年前012---Okay, it was, like, four years ago.
琴吉跟我约会了几次  有个周末…012---Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times. Then one weekend...
我们去了她父亲的小屋…012---...we went to her dad's cabin...
就我跟她  和她烦人的小狗  胡椒012---...just me, her and her annoying little dog, Pepper. Heh.
那一晚  我煮了一道  很浪漫的晚餐…012---Well, that night I cooked this really romantic dinner...
你在食物中下毒012---You gave her food poisoning.
我还希望是如此012---I wish. No.
晚餐后  我  她和小狗  都在炉火前睡着了012---After dinner, me, her and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire.
我在半夜醒来  看到火快没了012---Well, I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out...
所以捡了一块木头  丢进去012---...so I picked up a log and threw it on.
至少我以为那是块木头012---Or at least what I thought was a log.
天啊  你把狗丢进去012---Oh, my God. You threw Pepper on the fire.
我希望如此012---I wish.
还有一件琴吉的事  我或许得告诉你们…012---See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger...
她其实…012---...is that she kind of has a, uh...
装了假腿012---...artificial leg.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
乔伊  你把她的腿丢到火里之后  怎么了012---Joey. What did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
我就跑了012---I ran.
那是我有过的最棒的吻…012---Well, that's the best kiss I've had...

对  去听演讲012---Yeah, at the lecture.
我上个礼拜就跟你说了  你说你不介意012---I told you that last week. You said you didn't mind.
噢  不是  不是听演讲的关系012---Oh, no, no, no. It's not the lecture, uh, I mind. Um...
拜托不要说  是因为我跟马克去的关系012---Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
嗯… 天啊  罗斯012---Well... Oh, my God. Ross.
很抱歉  但是… 如果他不是你的同事了012---Well, I'm sorry, but... Look, if you're not working with him anymore...
为什么还要跟他出去012---...why do you still have to do stuff with him?
因为他是我的朋友012---Because he's my friend.
好  但你真的需要  多一个朋友吗…012---Okay. But do you really need another friend? I mean...
好  如果我不跟乔伊和钱德玩  就可以跟马克玩吗012---Okay. Well, if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
这很好笑吗  我应该笑吗012---Is that funny? Am I suppose to be laughing?
我不知道  你也觉得 "星期六见"很好笑012---I don't know. You thought "See you Saturday" was funny.
马克是时尚界的人012---Look, honey, Mark is in fashion, okay?
我喜欢有共同兴趣的朋友012---I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.
你们永远不会跟我去听演讲的012---You guys would never go to a lecture with me.
我很想跟你去012---I would love to go with you.

你知道  人们常说 "有人看的锅子不会叫"012---You know, they say, "A watched pot never beeps."
只是… 已经几个小时了…012---It's, you know, ahem... It's been a couple hours...
她还没打来012---...and she hasn't called.
也不是说我在乎  我一点都不012---Not that I even care. I don't.
菲比  你为什么不直接打给她012---Phoebe, why don't you just call her?
很明显你想要打012---You obviously want to.
你以为你很了解我012---You think you know me so well.
你不想打吗012---Well, don't you wanna? Yeah.

怎么样   我做不到012---Well, so?  I can't.
做不到  她甩了我012---I can't. She dumped me.
我完全相信她   然后突然有一天…012---I mean, I totally trusted her, and then one day it was like:
"好  再见了  菲比"  就这样走了012---"Okay, bye, Pheebs." Gone.

你懂吗012---You know what I mean?
我喜欢你不属于  我那个生活的一部分012---I mean, it's like I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
这样清楚多了012---That's a little clearer.
这不代表我不爱你…012---Honey, see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you...
