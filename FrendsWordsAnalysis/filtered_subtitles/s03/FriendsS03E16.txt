《老友记》前情提要\N我是说我觉得我不像有女朋友了012---Previously on Friends: I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.
你要我辞掉工作  让你觉得你有女朋友012---You want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
这跟马克有关吗  天啊012---Is this about Mark? Oh, my God.
好吧  跟他无关  我的天啊012---Okay, it's not. Oh, my God.
我不能为同一件事情老是跟你吵架012---I cannot keep having this fight with you!
听着  或许我们该休息一下012---Look, ugh, maybe we should just take a break.
好吧  你说的对  我们休息一下012---Fine. You're right. Let's, uh, take a break.
我们去吃冷冻优格吧  不012---Let's get some frozen yogurt. No.
我们该分手了012---A break from us.
我们大吵一架  我跟他说我要分手012---Then we had this big fight, and I said I wanted to take a break.
我不想分手012---I don't want to take a break.
这太疯狂了012---This is crazy.
我们能解决这个问题吗  你要喝什么012---Can't we work on this? What do you want to drink?
是谁在说话012---Who's that?
没有啊012---Nobody.
是  马克吗  甜心  听着  他刚好…012---Is that Mark? Honey, look, he just...
对  我明白了012---Yeah. Got it!
来跳舞吧  你结婚了吗012---Hey, come dance. What are you, married?
我不在乎012---Ha, ha. Because that's okay.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
周年纪念日晚餐吃得如何012---How was the big anniversary dinner?
其实我们没吃晚餐012---Well, we never actually got to dinner.
太棒了012---Ha, ha, oh. Nice.
我们分手了012---We kind of broke up instead.
什么012---What? Aah!
天啊  连天花板都喷到了012---My God! It's on the ceiling!
没关系012---That's okay.
这比我的天花板沾了水果012---This is more important than fruit...
还要重要012---...on my ceiling.
你们分手了012---You broke up?
对  没关系的  罗斯离开后  马克刚好过来012---Yeah, but it's okay because when Ross left, Mark came over.
不  你跟马克  不  没事的  冷静点012---Oh, no! You and Mark? No, it's okay. Calm down.
马克跟我谈过012---Mark and I talked...
我了解到我多爱你的笨哥哥012---...and I realized how much I love your stupid brother.
我们是有一些问题  我真的想解决012---We got our problems, but I really wanna make it work.
早安012---Morning!
012---Friends S03E16 The One the Morning After
嗨  是我012---Hi, it's me.
我整晚都在找你  我真的好难过012---I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful.
求求你  罗斯  你得知道  我跟马克没什么012---Please, Ross, you've got to know, there's nothing between me and Mark.
分手这件事太蠢了012---This whole breakup thing is just stupid.
抱歉我让你受苦了012---Ugh, I'm sorry I put you through it.
我不想用答录机跟你合好012---And I don't want to get back together over a machine.
我爱你012---So I love you.
我爱你012---I love you.
你知道吗  我要睡了012---And you know what? I'm gonna go to bed now...
不过明天我去上班的时候  八点半会顺道去你家  再见012---...but on my way to work tomorrow, I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.
可洛  你还好吗012---Chloe, how's it coming?
你觉得我该养哪种狗012---What kind of puppy do you think I should get?
我不知道  买只大狗怎么样012---Um, oh, hey. I don't know. How about a big one?
但我的公寓很… 那就养只小狗012---But my apartment's so... Then a small one.
你得走了  等一下  我的鞋子在哪里012---We have to go. Wait! Where's my shoes?
你需要鞋子吗012---You need shoes?
为什么我们要这么赶  还记得我跟你说的女朋友吗012---Do I know why we're rushing?  You know my girlfriend?
她想跟我复合012---It turns out that she, uh, wants to get back together.
我找到了012---I found it!
我为你们感到高兴  你一定很开心012---That's so great for you guys! You must be so happy!
对  那是我现在的感触之一012---Yes, I am. One of the many things I'm feeling.
祝你跟你女朋友一切顺利   谢谢012---Good luck with your girlfriend. Oh, thank you. Ah, eh.
瑞秋012---Rachel!
你听到我的留言了吗   你还真是准时012---You got my message? You are right on time!
怎样  我能再当你的女朋友吗012---So can I be your girlfriend again?
当然可以  这样最好了012---Yes, you can. Very much.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
为什么你在擦天花板  香蕉粘在上面了012---Why are you mopping your ceiling? Ugh, there's banana on it.
有个印第安老女人的灵魂  住在我的身体里012---I have the spirit of an old Indian woman living in mine.
那么你应该了解012---So then you know.
邮差刚好过来  我帮你把邮件拿上楼012---The mailman was here, so I brought your mail.
太好了  谢谢  法布科技是什么东西012---Oh, good. Thanks. Now, what is Fabutech?
别批评我  好吗012---Okay. Don't judge me too much, okay?
我看到广告  我发誓我从来没有012---I saw this infomercial, and, um, I swear I have never...
买过电视购物频道的东西012---...bought anything on TV before.
除了这支拖把012---Except for this mop.
但这个腿部蜜蜡除毛产品  看起来好棒啊012---But there was this stuff on leg-waxing, it looked amazing.
蜜蜡除毛  对  你看到了吗012---Waxine! Yes! Have you seen it?
太不可思议了  我想当蜜蜡除毛女郎012---It's incredible! I want to be a Waxine Girl!
我知道012---I know!
天啊  你觉得真的不痛吗  他们是怎么办到的012---God! Do you think it really doesn't hurt? How can they do that?
最近在雨林发现的有机物质012---Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the rain forest?
那里的东西是最棒的了012---They have the best stuff in there.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
我们找不到你  还以为你跑回家跟瑞秋合好了012---We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone to make up with Rachel.
其实你该那么做012---Which is probably what you should have done, huh? Heh.
你说呢012---You think?
天啊  我真的好痛苦  我该怎么办012---God, I'm in hell. I mean, what am I gonna do?
瑞秋一直说我爱你  我满脑子只想着012---Rachel's all "I love you," and all I can think about...
如果我把实情告诉她  她会有什么反应012---...is what is she gonna do when I tell her what I did?
首先我们该强调一下重点012---First, we should address the more important question...
你到底有多笨呢012---...how dumb are you?
什么  听着  我们想复合012---What? Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right?
不诚实以对  还谈什么感情012---How am I supposed to do that without being total-honesty?
罗斯  我完全支持诚实以对那一点012---I'm on board about the total-honesty thing. I am.
不过会惹麻烦的事  还是少说为妙012---Just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
他说的对  这对大家没好处  你只会伤害她012---He's right. Nobody benefits, and you'll just hurt her.
到时候感情也没了012---And there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
你不觉得…012---Don't you think...?
如果你非告诉她不可  至少等到时机成熟012---If you have to tell her, at least wait till the timing's right.
所以临终之前才要忏悔012---And that's what deathbeds are for.
好吧  太棒了012---Yeah, okay. All right.
好吧  我们得确定  她不会从别的地方知道这件事012---Okay. Now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way.
你有考虑切断关联吗012---Did you think about the trail?
什么关联012---What trail?
跟你一起做的女人012---From the woman you did it with...
到你千方百计要隐瞒的女人012---...to the woman you hope never finds out you did it!
一定要切断关联012---Always think about the trail!
我想她们没有关联012---I don't think there's any trail.
好吧012---Okay, okay.
可洛跟艾萨克是同事012---Chloe works with that guy, Isaac.
艾萨克的姊姊是洁丝敏   她跟菲比是按摩店的同事012---Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works at the massage place with Phoebe.
菲比是瑞秋的同事  那是她们的关联  我找到了012---Phoebe is Rachel's friend, and that's the trail! I did it!
将蜜蜡涂在腿上  贴好亚麻布012---PHOEBE: "After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg..."
好了  好的012---Did that!  Okay.
抓住亚麻布的末瑞012---"Grasp the linen strip by its tab...
快速地将它往上扯012---...and pull it off in one quick...
完全不会痛  好的012---...pain-free motion." Okay.
不是不会痛吗012---Was it not "pain-free"?
不  是痛死了012---No, it was pain-ful!
天啊  他们该叫它超痛蜜蜡除毛012---My God, they should call it "Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
广告里的女孩似乎觉得  好像不觉得有这么痛012---The girls on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
因为她们笨到神经麻木了012---Because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid.
如果你不相信  自己试试看吧012---But, you know, if you don't believe me, please be my guest.
天啊012---Ow, ow, ow! Oh, my God!
你该庆幸  我们没有先贴比基尼布条除毛了吧012---Now are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
可洛012---Chloe, hi.
你来质问我  拿走你手表了吗012---Is this about me taking your watch?
你拿走我的手表  抱歉  我会这么做012---You took my watch? I'm sorry. I do that.
手表送你  听着  你有跟任何人提起我们的事吗012---You keep it. Listen, did you tell anyone about us?
不  我觉得那不关别人的事012---Oh, no. I feel like it really isn't anybody's business.
没错  你什么都没跟艾萨克说吧012---Exactly. So you didn't mention anything to Isaac?
我什么事都跟艾萨克说  是吗  那当然012---Oh, I tell Isaac everything. You do? Of course you do.
艾萨克  我们没有正式介绍过012---Hi, Isaac. You know, we haven't actually met.
你超猛的012---You dog!
我想我是超猛的  听着  我刚好有女朋友012---Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.
对   咖啡厅的瑞秋012---Right. Rachel from the coffee place.
就是她  听着  我不想伤害她012---That's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
我了解  不论我们多爱她们012---Oh, hey, man, I know. It doesn't matter how much we love them.
一夫一妻制真的很残忍012---Monogamy is too cruel a rule.
对  听着  你能帮我保密吗012---Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
没问题  我们要互相关照才行012---Oh, no problem. We gotta look out for each other.
你跟我是一丘之貉012---We're the same, you and me.
其实我们不是的012---Actually, no, we're not. Heh.
对  我们就是012---Yeah, we are.
不  不是的012---No, we're not.
对  就是012---Yeah, we are.
不  不是的012---No, we're not.
好吧  不是的  对012---Okay, we're not. Right.
不过事实上就是012---But we are.
好吧  我只是要知道  你没跟你姊姊说012---Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
我可以保证不会再跟她提012---I can promise not to tell her again.
洁丝敏012---Jasmine? Uh-huh.
我们在菲比的生日派对上见过面  我是罗斯盖勒012---We met at Phoebe's birthday party. I'm Ross Geller.
你做了坏事012---You did a bad thing!
没错   非常坏012---Yes, I did. Very bad!
非常坏   对  超级坏012---Very bad. Very, very bad!
我同意你的说法012---I'm agreeing with you.
听着  你跟菲比说了吗012---Listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
还没有  好的  洁丝敏012---No. Okay. Jasmine.
求求你别跟她说012---Please. Please don't.
我非常爱我的女朋友  我希望能跟她有结果012---I love my girlfriend very much and I want to work it out with her.
好吧012---All right.
谢谢你012---Thank you. Thank you.
不过你该跟我的室友谈  因为我跟他说了  他也认识菲比012---But you should talk to my roommate. I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.
你的室友是谁012---Who's your roommate?
阿甘012---Gunther! Gunther!
请跟我说你没告诉瑞秋   我跟影印店女孩的事012---Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我不该说吗012---Was I not supposed to?
我们没事   没事的012---We're all right. It's okay. It's okay.
我们只是在做腿部蜜蜡除毛   是吗012---Ooh! We were just waxing our legs. Off?
我得说这是男人不懂的痛苦012---For your information, this is a pain like no man will ever experience.
你无权那么说  除非你也被踢到012---You can't make that statement unless you've been kicked in an area...
上帝要我们好好保护的地方012---...that God only meant to be treated nicely.
女人的忍痛能力就是没有男人好012---Women just have a lower threshold for pain than men, that's all.
少来了  只是蜜蜡除毛而已012---I mean, come on, it's just a little wax. Heh.
是吗  过来012---Oh, yeah? Come here.
还真是成熟012---Oh, that's mature.
现在只要把它撕下来012---So now I just pull it off? - Uh-huh.
没错012---That's right.
瑞秋  别这样  跟我说话   拜托012---Rachel, come on. Just talk to me. Please!
我连看都不想看你一眼  什么012---I can't look at you right now. What?
没事012---Nothing. Nothing.
她说一切都没事的啊  他们在说什么012---She said it was okay. What are they talking about?
离我远一点  我错了  好吗012---Just get away from me! I made a mistake, okay?
你错了 你想把你的宝贝  放在哪里  她的皮包里012---A mistake? What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?
他把他的宝贝放在哪里012---Whe...? Where did he put it?
罗斯  你跟别的女人上床012---You had sex with another woman!
天啊012---Oh, my God! - Oh...
我就知道出事了  因为昨天我的指甲没有变长012---I knew something was wrong because my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.
我猜他们吵了一架   他喝醉了012---I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...
你们知道这件事  却没有告诉我们012---You guys knew about this and didn't tell us?
他跟女人上床  结果是我们被打头012---He has sex, and we get hit in our heads!
我要你离开  快给我滚出去  不012---I want you to leave! Get out! Now! No! No!
我要留下来好好谈谈012---I want to stay and talk about this.
好吧  她的功夫如何012---Okay! All right. How was she?
什么   她很厉害吗012---What? Was she good?
别回答那个问题012---Don't answer that.
你说你要谈的  来谈吧  她的功夫如何012---You said you wanted to talk about it. Let's talk. How was she?
她… 很可怕012---She was... Awful.
一点都不棒   超逊的  比不上你012---She was not good. Horrible. Nothing compared to you.
她不一样012---She... She was different.
好的不一样012---Good different?
没有人喜欢改变012---Nobody likes change.
住口  什么  好吧012---Just stop! What? Okay! Okay! Okay!
我们该想想办法吗012---Should we do something?
对  千万别背叛瑞秋012---Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.
对不起  好吗  连我都讨厌我自己012---I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I was disgusted with myself...
今天早上我好难过012---...and this morning I was upset...
我听到你的留言时开心极了012---...and then I got your message, and I was so happy.
我只希望她能离开我的公寓012---And all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment...
等一下012---Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute.
你的小朋友何时离开的012---What time did your little friend leave?
天啊  当时她还在那里012---Oh, my God. She was there? She was still there?
我在那里时  她也在012---She was in there when I was in there?
听着  重点是她对我而言毫无意义012---Listen, the important thing is, she meant nothing to me.
但她却能毁了我们的关系012---And yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship!
那时我以为我们之间完了012---I didn't think there was a relationship.
我以为我们分手了  我们只是分开一下012---We'd broken up. We were on a break.
我只知道那可能会是永远  就跟分手一样012---That, for all I knew, could last forever. That is a breakup.
你想用技术问题逃脱吗012---You're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
我没有想到逃脱012---I'm not trying to "get out" of anything.
我以为我们之间结束了012---I thought our relationship was dead.
你真的很会挑出轨时间012---Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.
我想我们不该再听下去了012---I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
你在做什么  我们不能出去012---What are you doing? We can't go out.
为什么  我饿了012---Why not? I'm hungry.
他们会知道我们一直在偷听012---Because they'll know we've been listening.
天啊  我还得让阿甘来告诉我012---God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!
少来了  我跑遍全城  只为了确定不会发生那种事012---Come on, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
那真是贴心012---Oh, that is so sweet.
我想我又爱上你了012---I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
我们可以出去  他们还有别的事要担心012---We can go out. They have other things to worry about.
我们会没事的012---We'll be fine.
瑞秋  我想告诉你  我觉得该告诉你012---Rachel, I wanted to tell you. I thought I should.
但钱德跟乔伊说服我别那么做012---And then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to!
用蜜蜡把门封住  我们永远都不要出去012---Wax the door shut. We're never leaving.
我是菲比  得有人帮我接九点的班  为雷哈克先生服务012---It's Phoebe. Someone has to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak...
现在是9点15分  我还没有到店里012---...because it's 9: 15 now, and I'm not there.
难道你不知道  不该发生这种事的  要不是我以为012---None of this would've happened if I didn't think...
你跟马克上床了012---...you were having sex with Mark.
好吧012---All right.
就算我跟马克上床了  你会原谅我吗012---Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
我会的012---Yes, I would.
你能接受马克吻我   跟我裸体面对012---You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me and been naked with me...
和我做爱吗012---...and made love to me?
当然可以012---Yes.
如果你知道我们火烫汗湿的身体…012---If you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...
好吧  我会非常抓狂012---Okay. Okay, yeah. I would have been devastated...
但我还是想跟你在一起012---...but I would still want to be with you.
因为是你012---Because, I mean, it's you.
什么012---What?
快告诉我  你在想什么012---Come on, tell me what you're thinking.
我在想…012---I'm thinking...
我要叫披萨012---...I'm gonna order a pizza.
叫披萨的意思是…012---Order a pizza, like...
"我原谅你了"012---..."I forgive you"?
天啊012---Oh, man!
披萨012---Pizza?
我喜欢披萨012---I like pizza.
在披萨上面加橄榄012---Put olives on the pizza.
我们可以吃蜜蜡  它是有机蜜蜡012---We could eat the wax! It's organic!
太棒了  有毛的食物012---Oh, great. Food with hair on it.
不是吃用过的蜜蜡012---No, not the used wax.
那么做的话太疯狂了012---Because that would be crazy?
可以算我一份吗  我也饿了012---Could I get in on that? Because I'm kind of hungry myself.
好吧012---Fine.
我要订大份披萨012---Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
不要鳀鱼  多加些鳀鱼012---No anchovies. With, uh, extra anchovies.
没关系  我可以挑出来012---That's okay. I'll pick them off.
拜托你切一下加在酱汁里012---And could you chop some up and put it right in the sauce?
如果你要的话  最后一块给你吃012---You can have the last piece if you want.
那应该是我的披萨  你跟别人上床012---Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
他们应该会和好  对吧012---They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
当然  少来了  他们是罗斯与瑞秋012---Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.
他们非和好不可012---They've got to.
如果他们真的分手呢012---What if they don't?
你们觉得我需要换新走路方式吗012---You think I need a new walk?
什么012---What?
我从高中以后就用相同的方式走路012---Well, I've been walking the same way since high school.
你们知道有些人一走进来  大家会立刻注意到他吗012---You know how some guys walk into a room and everybody takes notice?
我想我得用  会引起大家注意的方式走路012---I think I need a take-notice walk.
你是认真的吗012---Are you actually saying these words?
怎么  现在你连话都不跟我说了012---What, now you're not even talking to me?
听着  瑞秋  对不起  我疯了012---Look, Rachel, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.
我以为我失去你了  我不知道该怎么做012---I thought I'd lost you.
拜托  我一定是疯了  才会做出那种事吧012---How insane must I have been to do something like this?
我不会外遇  对吧  那不是我的作风  我不是乔伊012---I don't cheat, right? That's not me. I'm not Joey!
对  好吧012---Yeah, okay.
嘿012---Hey.
已经凌晨三点了  他们不知道我回家了012---It's 3 a.m. They don't know that I've come home yet.
你们注意到  他们根本没担心我在哪里吗012---You notice how they aren't wondering where I am?
对  有些人就是只想到自己012---You know, people can be so self-involved.
你知道吗  想分手的人不是我012---You know what? I'm not the one that wanted that break.
放弃的人是你  面对难关时012---You're the one that bailed. You're the one...
想要逃走的人是你012---...that ran the moment things got rough.
