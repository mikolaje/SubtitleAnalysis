乔伊  这就是你父母叫你不要在床上跳的原因012---See, Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
《老友记》  第三季  第3集 爱果酱的人012---Friends S03E03  The One with the Jam
看看我  我在做果酱012---Hey, look at me. I'm making jam.
我早上四点就起来了  那么早你怎么可能买得到水果012---I've been at it since 4:00 this morning.  Where'd you get fruit at 4 in the morning?
在码头那边买的012---Went down at the docks.
你一定不知道能买到批发价012---Bet you didn't know you can get it wholesale.
我根本不知道有码头012---I didn't know there were docks.
嘿  嘿012---Hey.
你手断了吗012---Aw, is it broken?  Aw.
不  但得挂着这东西几个星期012---No, but I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
你有没有告诉医生  你是因为在床上跳才受伤012---Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
不  我编的故事本来行得通的  但是…012---No. I had a whole story worked out, but then...
钱德出卖了我012---...Chandler sold me out.
抱歉  乔伊012---I'm sorry, Joe.
我想医生不会相信你说的手臂自己断了012---I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just fell out of his socket.
这是什么  水果吗012---What is this? Fruit?
摩妮卡在做果酱012---Monica's making jam.
我最爱果酱了  我们家怎么从来没有果酱012---Jam? I love jam. Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
因为孩子们需要买新鞋012---Because the kids need new shoes.
我得做正事了  我不想再为理查的事烦心012---I'm going into business, people. I'm sick of being depressed about Richard.
我需要一个计划  来忘记我的男人012---I needed a plan. A plan to get over my man.
什么是男人的反义词   就是果酱012---What's the opposite of man? Jam.
乔伊  别动  太烫了012---Joey, don't. It's way too hot.
那么这就算我的了012---This will just be my batch.
到此止步  嘿  你这位穿名牌的…012---Um, that's it. No. Hey you. J. Crew guy...
你干嘛跟踪我012---Yeah. Why are you following me?
这一周来  我在哪里都能看到你012---All week long, everywhere I look, there's you.
你不回我电话  又把我的信退回来012---You wouldn't return my calls. You sent back my letters.
什么   再给我一次机会  乌苏拉012---What?  One more chance, Ursula. Please.
真是太尴尬了012---Oh. Well, this is awkward.
怎么了012---Why? - Um...
你要找的是乌苏拉  而我是菲比  我们是双胞胎姐妹012---Yeah, because you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.
我认真的012---Seriously.
真不好意思  我跟错人了012---Oh. That's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman.
我真是个傻蛋012---I am such a dingus!
你不是傻蛋012---Oh, you're not a dingus.
我只想让你知道  我不是一直这样的012---I just... I want you to know I didn't used to be like this.
在认识你姐姐之前  我只是012---Before I met your sister, I was, like, this normal guy...
卖手机的普通人012---...who sold beepers and cellular phones.
听着  这不是你的错  知道吗012---Well... I mean, look, it's not your fault, you know?
只是她对待男人就是这个样子012---I mean, this is just what she does to guys, okay?
就是…012---Just...
谢谢012---Well, thanks.
等等  我有个小故事告诉你012---Wait. You know what? I got a little story.
我在念国中时012---When I was in junior high school...
有一阵子  我以为自己是女巫012---...I went through this period where I thought I was a witch.
有个辅导员老师跟我说了一段的话012---And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me...
我想可以帮助你012---...that I think will help you a lot.
他说〝你根本不是女巫  你只是个普通学生〞012---He said, "Okay, you're not a witch. You're just an average student."
你懂我的意思吗  不是很懂012---See what I'm saying?  Not really.
忘了这段感情吧012---Um, well, get over it.
你看起来是个好人012---I mean, you just... You seem like a really nice guy.
别太难为自己  好吗012---You know, I just... Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?
没错  你说得没错  谢谢你对我这么好012---Wait, you're right. I know you're right. And thanks for being so nice.
给你012---Here. - Aah!
谢谢你012---Thanks a lot.
你要不要去喝杯咖啡012---Do you wanna get a cup of coffee or...?
好啊  好012---Yeah, okay.  Okay.
你不用走在我后面了012---You don't have to walk behind me anymore.
抱歉012---Sorry.
摩妮卡  摩妮卡012---Mon?  Mon?
〝去多买些罐子  等一下回来  摩妮卡盖勒〞012---"Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller."
等等  你看012---Wait a minute. Look.
看看… 怎么了…012---Look, look, look.  What, what, what?
整间公寓里都没人012---It's an empty apartment. - Mm.
这间空房里  只有我们两个012---We're all alone in an empty apartment.
我十分钟后得去上班012---Aw, honey, come on. I have to be at work in, like, 10 minutes and, oh...
好吧  我又不是模范员工012---All right. Well, it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
啊012---Ha, ha. Whoo!
在这里啊  这就是你要找的012---There it is. Oh. Oh, that's what you're talking about. Ahem.
嘿  嘿012---Hey.  Hey.
我看起来很胖吗012---Do I look fat?
不胖012---No.
这么说我可以接受012---Okay, I accept that.
当珍妮丝问我时  我回答不012---When Janice asked me and I said no...
她却认为我说她像母牛012---...she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
重头再说一次给我们听…012---Okay, walk us through it, honey. Walk us through it.
珍妮丝说…012---Okay, well, Janice said, uh:
〝我今天看起来胖吗  我看看她…012---"Hi. Do I look fat today?" And I looked at her...
你看看她012---You looked at her?
你绝不能看012---You never look.  Mm-mm.
你只能回答  就像条件反射 "我看起来胖吗" "不"012---You just answer. It's like a reflex. "Do I look fat?" "No."
"她比我漂亮吗" "不"012---"Is she prettier than I am?" "No."
"尺寸很重要吗  不012---"Does size matter?"  No.
这点男女都适用012---And it works both ways.
所以你们本来就知道这些012---Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
吵了大概三四十次架后 你大概就了解了012---You know, after about 30 or 40 fights, you kind of catch on.
例如012---Okay. For instance, ahem:
珍妮丝旅行回来  她给你两种选择012---Let's say Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options.
选择一  她从机场自己搭计程车回来012---Option number one: She'll take a cab home from the airport.
选择二  你在领行李的地方与她碰面  你会怎么做012---Or option two: You can meet her at baggage claim. What do you do?
简单  领行李的地方  错了  这样你就没女朋友啦012---That's easy. Baggage claim. Ehh! Wrong. Now you're single.
其实是第三个秘密绝招012---It's actually secret option number three.
你在接机门与她碰面  这就表现出你对她的爱012---You meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
好  这样真不错012---Hmm. Okay, this is good. This is good.
好  我有一个问题  珍妮丝喜欢抱抱…012---All right, listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle...
在晚上的时候  我当然也喜欢抱抱012---...at night, which I'm all for. - Mm.
不过当你想睡觉时  你会想要一点空间012---But, uh, you know, when you want to go to sleep, you want some space.
我要怎样告诉她  才不会…012---So, uh, you know, how do I tell her that without...
不小心又说她胖之类的012---...you know, accidentally calling her fat or something?
抱歉  我们帮不了你  因为我们都是抱着睡的012---Oh. Honey, I'm sorry. We can't help you there, because we're cuddly sleepers.
我上班要迟到了012---Okay, I'm late for work. Oh.
你们要不要下来   好  等一下就去012---Are you guys gonna come down? Uh, yeah. I'm right behind you.
祝你好运  钱德  谢了  瑞秋012---Good luck, Chandler. Thank you, Rachel.
再见  再见  宝贝  亲爱的012---Bye, sweetie. Bye, honey.
关于睡觉那件事012---Okay, the sleeping thing.
非常困难  但也不是没办法可想012---Very tricky business but there is something you can do.
我以为你们都是抱着睡觉  其实不是012---I thought you were cuddly sleepers. No.
不  不是抱着睡  不是我  只有她012---No, not cuddly. Not me. Just her.
我跟你一样  我需要空间012---I'm like you. I need the room. Ahem.
好  到这里来012---Okay, come here. Ahem.
好  现在你在床上012---Okay. You're in bed.
好吧012---Yeah?
我还是用靠垫好了  好吧012---I'm gonna use the cushion.  Yeah.
好  你在床上  她在你旁边  抱着你012---Okay. You're in bed. She's over on your side cuddling.
现在  你等她逐渐睡着…012---Now, you wait for her to drift off...
然后你抱住她…012---...and then you hug her...
然后把她滚到床的另一边012---...and roll her over to her side of the bed.
然后你…012---And then you...
你就滚到一边去012---...roll away.
抱住她012---Hug for her.
滚到一边去012---Roll for you.
就像以前的拥抱与翻滚   对012---Okay, the old "hug and roll." Yep.
只有一个问题  说吧012---Okay. One question.  Shoot.
你把枕头当作女生  对吧012---You're pretending the pillow's a girl, right?
记得小时候…012---Remember when you were a kid...
你妈会把你送到电影院…012---...and your mom would drop you off at the movies...
给你一罐果酱和一根小汤匙012---...with a jar ofjam and a little spoon?
你真可爱012---You're so pretty.
嘿  嘿  菲比012---Hi. Hey, Phoebe.
你知道那个跟踪我的人吗   我今天跟他说话了012---Hey, oh! You know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
你跟他说话  你疯了吗012---[MUMBLING] You talked to him? Are you crazy?
第一  我没有疯  第二  用嘴来说  别乱喷012---Okay, first, I'm not crazy. And second, say it. Don't spray it.
反正他叫做麦肯  他也不是在跟踪我012---Anyway, his name is Malcolm, and he wasn't following me.
我是说  他在跟踪没错  但他以为我是乌苏拉012---I mean, he was, but just because he thought I was Ursula. Ick.
所以他不敢上前来跟我说话012---And that's why... That's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me.
因为有禁制令012---Because of the restraining order.
我还是对麦肯没有好感012---Hmm. Not feeling better about Malcolm.
不  他不是疯子012---Oh! No, no, no, he's not like a kook.
他只是个非常热情  极度浪漫的家伙…012---No, he's just this, like, very passionate, incredibly romantic guy...
只是有点过火了012---...that just got a teensy bit carried away, you know?
我们处得很好  而且他很可爱012---And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
天啊  你竟然喜欢跟踪你姐姐的人012---Oh, my God. You've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
我要帮他忘记乌苏拉的一切012---No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get "de-Ursula-ized."
就像乔伊跟她约会后我为他做的一样012---Like, you know... Like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
我没有跟踪她012---Yeah, but I didn't stalk her. I mean...
你是鸡同鸭讲012---I asked for the news, not the weather.
嘿  大伙儿  嘿  摩妮卡012---Hey, guys. Hey, Mon.
乔伊  这是你的  这是黑莓红醋粟酱012---Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry currant.
太美妙了012---Yeah.
乔伊  我得问你012---Hey, Joe, I gotta ask.
影印店的那个女孩  全裸012---The girl from the Xerox place, buck naked...
还是你要一大缸果酱012---...or a big tub of jam?
你把两只手放在一起好了012---Put your hands together.
你慢慢吃啊  那是最后一批012---Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
没有果酱了012---No more jam?
你的果酱计划呢012---What happened to your jam plan?
我算过了  我每罐得卖17元才能打平012---Well, I figured out I'd need to charge 17 bucks a jar just to break even.
所以我有个新计划  就是生小孩012---So I've got a new plan now. Babies.
那你可能需要很大的罐子012---Well, you're gonna need much bigger jars.
你在讲什么   讲我要要生小孩的事012---What are you talking about? About me having a baby.
你是认真的吗  是的012---Are you serious? Yeah.
果酱计划让我开始掌握自己的生活012---The great thing about the jam plan was I was take control of my life.
所以我就想什么事对我最重要012---So I asked myself, "What is the most important thing to me?"
因此我就想出  生小孩这个计划012---And that's when I came up with the baby plan.
你是不是忘了什么012---Well, aren't you forgetting something?
那个家伙叫什么   叫〝爹地〞012---What is, uh...? What is that guy's name? Dad.
我花了28年  找到一个  想与他共度终身的男人012---It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanted to spend my life with.
如果我还得再等28年  我就得56岁才生小孩012---If I have to wait another 28 years, then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.
那样实在太愚蠢了012---And that's just stupid.
那样叫愚蠢012---That's what's stupid?
我不需要一个真正的男人  只要他几只会游泳的小家伙012---I don't need an actual man. Just a couple of his best swimmers.
而且你可以在某个地方  弄到那些小家伙012---You know? And there are places that you can go to get that stuff.
又要去码头了吗012---Down at the docks again?
晚安  大宝贝012---Night-night, Bing-a-ling.
晚安012---Night-night...
珍妮丝012---...Janice.
看看她那一边的空间012---CHANDLER: Look at all that room on her side.
都可以放一只大企鹅了012---You could fit a giant penguin over there.
不过那样会很奇怪012---That'd be weird, though.
要开始拥抱与翻滚了012---Hug and roll time.
我正在拥抱…012---I'm hugging. I'm hugging.
你在翻滚  然后…012---You're rolling, and...
太好了  自由了012---Yes! Freedom!
除了这只胳膊012---Except for this arm.
我被困住了  胳膊卡住了012---I'm stuck. Stuck arm.
该玩以前那种抽桌布的游戏了  一个华丽得快动作012---Okay, time for the old tablecloth trick. One fluid motion.
像猫一样矫捷012---Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.
一  二012---And one, two...
三012---...three.
这是我的望远镜012---Here's my binoculars.
很好  你做得很好012---Oh, great. Great. You're doing great.
很不错  继续吧012---You know, real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
这是我的夜视镜012---These are my night-vision goggles.
这是我在公园里看她时  假装阅读的书012---This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park.
这些是接字游戏  只是打发时间用的012---And these are Madlibs. They're just for fun.
噢  好吧  这是什么012---Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. What's this?
这是我写的日志  记录她的一举一动012---Oh. This is the log I kept, recording her every movement.
要不要听听看  我一点也不想听012---You want to hear something from it? Um, not even a little bit.
是跟你有关的  那好吧012---It's about you.  Oh, okay, then.
"我今天遇到菲比012---"I met Phoebe today.  Ha, ha.
她对我很好  即使我是个窝囊废"012---She was really nice to me even though I'm such a loser."
唔012---Oh.
当我走回家时  我不断想着她012---"And then when I was walking home, I thought about her a lot.
虽然很怪  但是很酷012---It was weird but kind of cool."
很好012---Good. Ha, ha.
你在想什么012---So, what were you thinking?
我在想亲你是什么感觉012---I was thinking what it'd be like to kiss you.
真的  开玩笑012---Really?  No.
哇012---Oh.
我是故意说的  这样我才能亲你012---See, that's just something I said now so that maybe I could kiss you.
噢  好吧012---Oh, okay. Ha!
不  不用了  我刚吃了一罐芥末012---No, it's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
好  捐精者编号0 3 8 15012---Okay. Sperm donor number 03815, come on down!
好  他是6尺2寸  170磅012---Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.
他形容自己是男性的吉娜戴维丝012---And he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
你是说除了我们之外还有别人012---You mean there's more than one of us?
你不能这样做  摩妮卡  如果你这么做  我会…012---You can't do this, Mon, all right? If you do this, I'm gonna...
你能怎样   我会告诉妈012---You're gonna what?  I'm gonna tell Mom.
很抱歉  他是对的  我爱你  可是你真的疯了012---Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
疯了  为什么这样就疯了012---Crazy.  What? Why? Why is this crazy?
就算这不是最理想方法  这根本不是…012---So this isn't the ideal way to do something...  Oh, it's not...
别打断  我还在讲话012---Lips moving. Still talking.
这样可能不太理想  但…012---It may not be ideal...
我真的准备好了012---...but I'm so ready.
我看到班  看着你的样子012---You know, I see the way Ben looks at you.
让我心好痛  你知道吗012---It makes me ache, you know?
你看看  果酱饼干012---Check it out. Jam crackers.
好吧  这个如何012---Okay. All right, how's this?

在皇后区出生012---Born in Queens.
大家族 七个姊妹  而且…012---Wow. Big family. Seven sisters...
他是唯一的男孩012---...and he's the only boy.
天啊  个人评论写着 〝《纽约尼克队》最厉害〞012---Oh, my God. Under personal comments: "New York Knicks rule."
对啊  《纽约尼克队》最厉害012---Yeah, the Knicks rule.
乔伊  这个是你012---Joey, this is you.
让我看看012---Let me see.
哦  对012---Oh, right.
你什么时候去过精子银行012---When did you go to a sperm bank?
就在我参加纽约大学的性研究之后012---Right after I did that sex study at NYU.
你记不记得你生日时我送你的毛衣012---Hey, remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
那是你用这样赚来的钱买的012---And that's how you bought it?
不  那是我捐精子那天穿的012---No. That's what I was wearing when I donated.
我真惊讶他们那里  还会有我的小家伙012---I'm kind of surprised there's any of my boys left.
那里竞争很激烈的012---Well, honey, it is pretty competitive.
还有真正的火箭科学家呢012---I mean, I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
或许我该叫他们012---Hey, maybe I should call this place...
把我演的《我们的日子》放上去012---...and get them to put my Days ofour Lives gig on here.
多增加点声势012---You know? Juice this puppy up a little.
嘿   你好012---Hey!  Hello.
那个疯子如何了012---ROSS: How's the maniac?
他真迷人  我们接吻了012---Oh, he's yummy. We did a little kissing. Aah!
菲比  你在搞什么012---Phoebe, what are you doing?
不  你们知道吗012---Oh, no, no, no. You know what?
不  他不会再犯了  他为了我戒掉了012---He's not into that anymore. He quit for me. Mm-hm.
那家伙迷恋你姐姐012---Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister...
天晓得到底有多久了012---...for God knows how long, okay?
他不可能就这样忘了她012---You don't just give up something like that.
他把他的夜视镜  和一切东西都交给我了012---Look, he gave me his night-vision goggles and everything.
一个有夜视镜的人说的话  你也敢信012---You're taking the word of a guy who has night-vision goggles?
他不再跟踪她了  你觉得他还在跟踪她吗012---What? He's not still following her. You think he's still following her?
快醒醒  感觉一下什么叫禁制令吧012---Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
你说我该怎么办012---What should I do?
若你真的很喜欢他  应该相信他才是012---I think that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
谢谢你  摩妮卡012---Thank you, Monica.
也许你该跟踪他  看他会去哪里012---Or you could follow him and see where he goes.
我也会这么做的  忘了我刚说的吧012---Oh, that's what I would do. Forget mine.
天啊  发生什么事012---Oh, my God. What happened?
钱德发神经  把我转一圈…012---Oh, God. Crazy Chandler, he spun me...
然后推下床012---...off the bed.
转圈圈啊  听起来很好玩012---Wow. Spinning. That sounds like fun. Oh.
我倒希望012---I wish.
他只是在试罗斯的那招  拥抱与翻滚012---No, you know, he was just trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.
罗斯的什么012---Ross' what?
当他抱住你把你滚到旁边  再…012---You know, like, where he hugs you and then he kind of rolls you away, and...
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
菲比  怎样012---Phoebe? Yes? Yes! Oh.
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
我只是在找我的…012---Oh, I was just here looking for my, um...
吃过的三明治  在这里012---My part of an old sandwich. Here it is! Oh!
你在跟踪我吗012---Were you following me?
也许012---Um, perhaps.
是的  我很抱歉012---Yes. Yes. I'm sorry.
我害怕你仍然迷恋我姐姐012---I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
所以你在监视我012---So you spied on me.
我真不敢相信你不信任我012---I can't believe you don't trust me.

〝我们不在你的厕所游泳  所以别在我们的池子尿尿〞012---"We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool."
我们才不会有那种标语  你会有的  那是我送的礼物012---We do not have one of those signs.Sure you do. It was a gift from me.
